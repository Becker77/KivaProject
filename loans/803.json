Her business is selling new clothing and catalog lingerie.  She has been in this business for two years.  She makes her sales to workers in a hospital and from her home to neighbors and acquaintances.  She says that she also works as a domestic employee some days of the week.  She buys the clothing in Patronato and Meiggs neighborhoods, in the city of Santiago and buys the lingerie directly from the brand's distributor.\r\n\r\nElodia will use her loan to buy catalog lingerie.  She says that she will only invest in this merchandise because, owing to the change in the season, it is more risky to buy clothing because you can end up left with merchandise which you are unable to sell.\r\n\r\nElodia says that during the winter season she buys cardigans, leggings and fleece clothing (a warm material).  One of her goals is to have established sales premises.  For this, she will need to extend her house and she will do it.  Elodia lives together with her husband and one of her personal dreams is to go on vacation and travel around another area of the country.  She says that the only thing stopping her is her work schedule.\r\n\r\nElodia is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that she is receiving from Fondo Esperanza as it allows her to invest in her business.  She says that her community bank is very good and united.  She is so keen that she has been holding the meetings in her own home for the past six months.  As regards the training sessions, she has learned new strategies for organizing her business.\r\n\r\nTalca is located in Maule region, in the central area of our country.  It is the region's administrative, financial and cultural center, being one of the most important cities in Chile's Central Valley.  There is an interesting reference to Talca in the Chilean phrase: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (Talca, Paris and London).  One of the suggestions as to its origins is that it comes from something an Englishman once said: \"Talca parece Londres' (Talca is like London), owing to the abundant fog which frequently covers the city during the winter, just as it does in the UK capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1006480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy catalog lingerie","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-02-20T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-21T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":381143,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":30451},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28953},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29506},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":30069},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30643},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31228},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31824},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32431},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":33050},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33681},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":34324},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34983}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":124.69,"local_amount":59404,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":59799.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315317},{"amount":125.04,"local_amount":59575,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59971.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031504},{"amount":196.66,"local_amount":93695,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":94318.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643681},{"amount":137.44,"local_amount":65481,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":65916.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283324264},{"amount":142.74,"local_amount":68005,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":68457.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430118},{"amount":73.43,"local_amount":34983,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332903}],"funded_date":"2012-02-21T11:44:50Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":393432,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is a 21-year-old Lebanese single woman living with her only parent and a working sibling.

He is married, and has three children aged four, twelve and fifteen. He has two additional dependents, a sister and her ward, who live with him. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Alhaji Mohamed established his used clothing business. He began his business because he wants to be self-reliant and to take care of his children. Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,800,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of SLL 5,000,000. \r\n\r\nAlhaji Mohamed has already received and successfully repaid four loans, and now requires a new loan in order to increase his stock.

She began her business with help from her elder sister who has relocated to another town, and with the aim of being able to cater for the needs of her family. Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,700,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan of SLL 4,500,000.

With the given funds, she will buy clothes and some necessary tools to start her service. She hopes that our lenders will give her help to develop her business due to experiencing financial lack.

She has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 25 years, starting this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to hard work and persistence, Totukan's business consists of one cow, five sheep, and five goats today, yielding about 6,000 som in profit every month.

Adri\u00e1n lived in another community, Bulo Bulo, about ten years ago with his wife and daughter, but he had to move to Chimor\u00e9 because of the separation from his wife. As a consequence of the separation he lost his house and all of his belongings. Thanks to his father\u2019s support, he has gotten back on his feet. He now has his own house and agricultural land where he plants rice, which he harvests every three months. This is his main source of income. He also works as a driver in the June 2 Labor Union. \r\n\r\nThe loan that Adri\u00e1n is requesting is to legalize his vehicle. By doing this he will have more income because he would be working with his own vehicle and continue paying for his daughter\u2019s studies. \r\n\r\nAdri\u00e1n dreams of a better future for his

Kadek hopes that through the MUK Pig Breeder Loan program, she will not only get capital but will also get training from MUK on the best way to feed and care for pigs.  Kadek will use her share of the loan to purchase piglets and pig feed. She already has a sow. She plans to sell the piglets after six months for use as fattening pigs. With her profits, she will help support her family of three by supplementing the income of her husband, who works as a farmer.

Now that she is 30, she farms in order to support her family. The land in Huaripampa is favourable for sowing peas and potatoes. She has her own land where she sows these products. \"Every year I plant peas twice, and it goes well for me,\" she says. Her husband is the one who works the hardest in the fields. Every day, Felipe gets up at dawn to clear weeds and care for his plants. Their potato plantation is 30 minutes away from where they live; the long days of working and transporting the products are tiring.\r\nRocio is a strong, resolute woman. These qualities allow her to confront any and every situation in the fields. She has been able to provide an education for their three children, who are the main reason she keeps working. Rocio plans to sow one more bag of pea seeds this season; this will mean 40 bags harvested. This will be her thirteenth loan with MFP. In the previous loan cycles, she demonstrated her punctuality with repayments; she plans to continue to be punctual.

The couple jointly takes care of the various household expenses.  Marie left school at the elementary level.  To cope with her various expenses, and for about four years now, she has been preparing meals (rice, pasta etc.) that she sells in her neighborhood.  She buys her supplies at a market in Benin.  In order to increase her activity level and to attract more customers, she is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9, along with the other members of the GBENONKPO group.

She has a creative business through which she offers a cleaning service for rugs and living room and dining room furniture.  She started this business in 2006.  Before that she worked for companies in the city for ten years.  Although she is a psychologist by profession, when she learned about this business, which she carries out through her mother-in-law in the city of Medell\u00edn, she became keen and started working with a lot of enthusiasm which she still hasn't lost.  She has grown and strengthened her business in the city of Barranquilla and has invested in marketing the business through leaflets, ads in newspapers and telephone directories, mobile ads, etc.  Most of her customers are households who need cleaning and upholstering services for their living room and dining room furniture, drapes and rugs.  Gisela has the help of one worker who handles the cleaning machine and leaves the furniture clean, unstained and dry the same day.  This is something her customers really like.  With her great business vision, Gisela has taken part in cleaning fairs organized by chain stores and large stores in the city.  She will invest her loan in buying supplies and hiring staff to collect from customers who pay 30 days after they have received this service.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCristeta dreams to expand her business and help her child through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVeronica operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells personal products for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVeronica hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

He lives in the rural part of this district, which is progressing a little, so for now, they only have basic electrical service.\n\nSegundo lives in an area that is thoroughly dedicated to agriculture and livestock raising, so he is not unfamiliar with these businesses, which are his principal economic activities. Segundo has 0.5 hectares of agricultural land, which is planted with lemons of good quality. As he tells us, this is an export product. He has been working in this business for approximately 6 years, because in the past he worked in the sale of animals, and in his desire to excel he decided to plant and look for better and larger markets for his products and thus be able to buy more hectares of agricultural land to improve his living conditions.

For social reasons, Bintou didn\u2019t have the chance to continue her elementary school studies, and she quickly became interested in earning money. After having failed at several businesses, she ended up opting to sell fruits, vegetables and tubers twelve years ago. She finds that this business generates a lot of money and works really well. In order to satisfy her clientele in quality and quantity by increasing the size of her business, she decided to turn to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven years ago. After having properly repaid five group loans, she is on her ninth individual loan, and all of her previous loans were repaid without difficulty. With this new loan, she plans to buy baskets of bananas and potatoes. She stocks up at different weekly fairs in villages neighboring Koutiala and in Sikasso, and sells her goods at the grand market of Koutiala to a clientele consisting of women and men, for cash or credit. She foresees earning an average of 150,000 FCFA per month, which she envisions using to repay the Soro loan, paying for family expenses, and investing back into her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1010639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy bananas and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-21T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-22T19:10:09Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757143},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91840.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251909},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251910},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91840.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410901},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449038}],"funded_date":"2012-02-22T01:25:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":394764,"name":"Mildred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mildred is a 28-year-old single lady from Nakuru.

Today, Tadjikhan has two heads of dairy cows and four sheep in her business, and sales of milk products and meat allow her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month. Tadjikhan also grows cotton on 0.84 hectares of irrigated land, and earns a profit from sales during the harvesting season. In order to further expand her business, Tadjikhan requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase livestock for fattening up and resale and to buy cotton seeds.

Su negocio desde hace 12 a\u00f1os, ha tenido muchas modificaciones de infraestructura, porque ha ido creciendo. As\u00ed mismo  en honor a su padre puso el nombre que hoy lleva este restaurante.  En su negocio trabaja con su hermano y un auxiliar en el proceso productivo, que son su mano derecha.  Hernando est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con esta actividad, con la que  ha logrado sacar adelante a su familia, conformada por su esposa y 3 hijos en las edades de 13 a\u00f1os, 4 y 6 meses de nacido.   Actualmente la \u00e9poca carnavalera,  trae consigo un gran incremento en sus ventas y su capital de trabajo, se torna insuficiente para responder a esta demanda y ofrecer precios competitivos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 refrescos y bebidas, adem\u00e1s de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos. Estas compras la realizar\u00e1 de contado y en mayor volumen,  lo cual disminuye el porcentaje de sus costos y es justamente lo que motiva el \u00e9xito de su inversi\u00f3n. ","en":"Hernando, who is 30 years old, is the proprietor of a restaurant in the center of the city, which he began as the result of a family tradition, since his parents worked in this business and he had to assume control because his father became sick. It has been his business for 12 years, and he has made many modifications in the infrastructure, because it has been growing. Also, to honor his father, he gave the restaurant the name that it carries today. In his business he works with his brother and an assistant in the production process, and they are his right hand. Hernando is very satisfied with this business, with which he has managed to raise his family, which consists of his wife and three children, ages 13, 4, and 6 months. Now the carnival season is approaching, and it brings with it a great increase in his sales, and his working capital becomes insufficient to respond to this demand and offer competitive prices. This is the reason why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that he will receive from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy soft drinks and beverages, in addition to ingredients to prepare his foods. He will make these purchases for cash and in large volume, which will decrease a percentage of his costs and is precisely what motivates the success of his investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1006637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to
