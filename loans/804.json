He has been living together with his partner, Victoria, for more than 18 years.  He has an elementary school level of education.  The couple have 8 children, 6 of whom are in school.  They live in Huancuni community, toward the north of Colomi, in the city of Cochabamba, on the shores of the lake.  They have lived there for 18 years.\r\n\r\nGregorio and his partner are farmers.  They grow potatoes, beans, 'oca' and 'papalisa' (native tubers).  They grow some of their crops on 4 hectares of farmland that they inherited from their parents in their own community and some on a 1 hectare plot of land that they own in Paracti community.  They also own 3 dairy cows, 1 cow which is raised for meat and 2 calves.  Gregorio and his partner built a new house in which they invested all of their savings.

Specifically, she makes weavings with a power loom in a workshop that she has set up in the dining room of her house. \r\n\r\nShe says she began in this field when she worked for a company selling wool. Later they sent her for training where she did a course in weaving. In this way she learned the trade. Over time she realized that she liked handicrafts and she bought her first power loom so that she could work independently. Currently she makes woven pieces with different designs, as she weaves a lot. Additionally, she has two big customers who buy her handicrafts at wholesale and then resell them at retail. One of these customers is an exclusive clothing store in the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar. She also makes pants, vests, t-shirts, and other innovative designs in women's clothing. She buys her merchandise, essentially \"wool\", in La Ligua (an area known for its artisanal textiles). One of her goals is to add-on to her house so that she can install her workshop in another area of the house. With this loan she will buy wholesale wool. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa mentions that she has been separated for three years. Right now she lives with her two children who are 16 and 10 years old. Her personal dreams are to give her children a better quality education. She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her as it allows her to invest in her business. She says that the communal bank group that she is a part of is very responsible and committed. With respect to the trainings, they have helped her to better organize her business accounting.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers north-west of Santiago.

Additionally, together with his wife and with the help of his children, they have implemented a small business selling chicha de jora (a native corn-based beverage), beer and food within their own home.  At this time, it is going very well for them, given that they already have their own customers in that area.\r\n\r\nAlejandro wants to purchase balanced food that he can feed to his animals and sell them at a better price, promoting them in the local markets as well as the markets of other villages where he is also already known for his many years in the business.  At the same time, he wants to purchase some of the equipment necessary to continue implementing his second business.  For this reason, Alejandro is requesting a loan in Edpyme Alternativa for the amount of 1800 Nuevos Soles, which will be invested in the aforementioned ways."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1007294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The area where Hilda lives, like many in this district, is principally devoted to agriculture and cattle raising.\r\n\r\nHildra raises and sells animals, principally sheep, goats and poultry. She has fixed up the rear part of her dwelling with specific places for the raising, fattening and promotion of each one of the animals that she sells. Hilda travels the markets of Chiclayo to sell her animals and has fixed customers who are drawn to her way of doing business. They note that she is a very responsible woman in terms of her business commitments.\r\n\r\nHilda has requested a loan from Edpyme Alternative for the sum of 1200 nuevos soles which she will use to purchase feed to fatten her animals and at the same time she will buy Eternit (corrugated zinc) that she will use for the roofs of her animal corrals so they will be more secure.\r\n\r\nHilda is already well known by this field partner because of the steady loans provided her, thanks to her responsible behavior and prompt repayments. Similarly she and her husband promise to make payments for this new loan in a responsible and timely manner.

Her good reputation had enabled her to get orders through women\u2019s groups at local ceremonies and for upcoming celebrations. \r\n\r\nShe joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso a year ago to meet the needs of a growing customer base. This is her second individual loan, and she will use it to buy 15 pieces of wax fabric and 5 pieces of embroidered fabric in Bamako. She sells door to door in the various office buildings of Koutiala and from her home, for cash or on credit payable monthly, to a clientele consisting of both men and women.\r\n\r\nShe expects to earn a monthly profit of 90,000 CFAF, which she will use to repay her loan, to provide for the needs of her family, and to expand her activity. An ambitious woman, she would like to open a shop where she would sell fabrics and other items at the big market of Koutiala.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1010656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy wax and other fabrics for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-22T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-23T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":43750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757145},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251912},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251913},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410903},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449040},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502774},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268452},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":44989.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498864}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T13:52:52Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":391833,"name":"Johanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johanna  de 28 a\u00f1os vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 3 hijos en las edades de 1 a 6 a\u00f1os, ella es consultora de productos  como detalles del hogar, dulces, accesorios  y adornos.

","en":"Hanifa is an elderly woman with eight children, all of whom have their own households.  She is currently retired together with her husband, Abdukodir, and they are raising their grandchildren.  They also look after livestock, some of which they purchased with our loan and her savings, and were, thus, able to increase their livestock quantity.

","en":"Faizullo is an active young guy and a family man with two children. He and his wife Manzura were engaged in the same business, but as Manzura is raising their small child, she is not currently working. For almost 15 years Faizullo has been making kebabs (a traditional meat dish) and selling them ready-to-eat near the entrance to the local hospital, where he has his diner-like spot. It's a crowded place with many visitors, and Faizullo sells over 150 kebabs daily, while also serving fish and beer. \r\n\r\nFaizullo first came to MDO Arvand, LLC six years ago, and since then has been taking loans continuously to expand his business. Every day Faizullo purchases raw ingredients at the market using his car. The vehicle has become worn out and requires daily expenditures, so Faizullo is planning to buy a new car as he cannot do without one. He has saved up some money on his own, and is requesting this loan to cover the balance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1011346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new car for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-02-22T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-23T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faizullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":149.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":153.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":172.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":180.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":185.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":185.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":146.2,"local_amount":146.2,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":146.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095169},{"amount":149.69,"local_amount":149.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":149.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919629},{"amount":153.27,"local_amount":153.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197649},{"amount":156.93,"local_amount":156.93,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":156.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197334},{"amount":160.69,"local_amount":160.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":160.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397392},{"amount":164.53,"local_amount":164.53,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":164.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452217},{"amount":168.46,"local_amount":168.46,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":168.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212470},{"amount":172.48,"local_amount":172.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":172.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443223},{"amount":727.75,"local_amount":727.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":727.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048196}],"funded_date":"2012-03-21T14:38:36Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":395050,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 40,000 through NWTF to purchase additional fishing net and other fishing equipment for her fishing business.\r\n\r\nNenita has been in this business for five years.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nErlinda dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1011282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-22T07:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-23T07:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275604},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2832.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997988},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2831.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606528},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2832.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095387}],"funded_date":"2012-02-22T08:46:32Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Natalie Eslick","image":1085366}},{"id":395056,"name":"Nourng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nourng, age 52, is a  humble local farmer who cultivates rice crops for her livelihood.

is a 24-year-old single man who lives in Sana`a, Yemen. He has been operating a spice store and has worked a great part of his life with the intention, first of moving his parents ahead, and now of providing a better quality of life for them. Formerly he used to work with his father in the store and thus contributed toward meeting family expenses at that time.

However, he does not have enough capital to make all of these purchases, and so it is for this reason that he requested a youth loan of 300000 YER from AMB.

She tells us that, some years ago, she decided to start her own business selling soft drinks and Mexican snacks (empanadas, tostadas, fried tacos and picadas) because she wanted to support her husband with their household expenses and enjoy a better quality of life.  Adela tells us that she rented a small sales location next to the elementary school and this is where she sells her soft drinks and sweet treats.  She also sells Mexican snacks (empanadas, tostadas, fried tacos and picadas).  During recess she puts her food on a table to sell.  She says that her business is doing well because the children buy their breakfast there and she is already popular with the students.  \r\n\r\nAdela needs this loan to buy corn dough, tortillas, oil, cheese, meat, soft drinks, juice, cream, disposable plates and candies.

Con su credikiva lograr\u00e1 una inversi\u00f3n exitosa, porque lo hace sobre pedidos,  que garantizan una rotaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de sus ventas y con descuentos especiales que agregan valor a su venta. Su meta mas adelante es tener su propia casa y para disminuir los gastos de arriendo del hogar y disfrutar de mayor sosiego familiar. ","en":"56-year-old Teresa is a married woman who has two children aged 28 and 36.  She has been selling cosmetics in Atl\u00e1ntico department for 10 years and used to carry out the same business when she lived in the country's capital city.  Teresa currently lives together with her husband as her two children are living in other cities in Colombia.  She makes income from her own business selling perfume and vegetables to a market consisting of housewives and small businesses.  She makes her sales for cash and on credit.  As her customer base continues to grow, her working capital is not enough to respond to her buyers in a timely manner.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy vegetables and a variety of merchandise including cosmetics and perfume.  She has specialized product catalogs which she uses to promote and sell her products.  Teresa will make a successful investment with her Kiva loan because she sells to order.  This guarantees her a quick sales turnover and she enjoys special discounts which makes her more profits on her sales.  Her goal for the future is to own her own home so that she can reduce her rental expenses and live more peacefully with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1006640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband and she are raising two children, and their youngest daughter is three years old.  Gulmira's family's primary business is fattening up and reselling livestock and farming.

Each bag of manure costs 120PEN and each sack of dung is 5PEN.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1004569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"Comprar bolsas de abono y sacos de guano de ave de corral.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-22T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-23T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2012.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446529}],"funded_date":"2012-02-22T22:57:40Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":392512,"name":"Reina Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reyna Isabel tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tiene 2 hijos de 5 y 12 a\u00f1os de edad, los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, vive en la Aldea La Esperanza, Tela.\nReyna hace dos a\u00f1os que estableci\u00f3 su propio negocio de pulper\u00eda para vender productos alimenticios como arroz, frijoles, harina, manteca, huevos, refrescos, embutidos, condimentos etc. anteriormente trabajaba en un hospital como enfermera pero los ingresos no eran suficientes y por eso decidi\u00f3 este negocio.

They live in the south of the city which is where she has her two businesses.  One of her businesses is selling a variety of merchandise to fill orders made by her customers and the other is selling fried food and soft drinks.  She started her main business selling general merchandise more than 15 years ago, with a small amount of working capital, mainly selling clothing and footwear.  She then received a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo as a member of a community bank.  She used the loan to improve her income and start her new business.  Aideth has been working with this organization for 18 years and she has received 21 loans which she has invested wisely in her businesses. She has managed to increase her working capital and also her income.  Aideth is currently applying for a Kiva loan to buy fried products and soft drinks.  She will also buy school supplies, footwear and uniforms because her regular customers need them as students are starting their classes right now.

It is comprised of seven members and directed by a board headed by Catalina. The businesses run by the members of the communal bank are varied. Among them are selling chu\u00f1o (freeze dried potato flour), making hats, sewing macram\u00e9 blankets, selling pants and selling layettes.\r\nCatalina reports that she has been working with Pro Mujer for two years and that she became a part of the institution because she was invited by a promoter. She currently owns a hat making business. She's been in this line of work for years and she learned it from her former boss.\r\nThe loan she requests now is to increase her working capital by purchasing leather from hardware stores by wholesale. After crafting it, she will sell it in her sales booth. This line of work allows her to get an income in order to support her family, since she's married and has three children.\r\nWhen asked about what she likes most about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health services. \r\nIn the picture, Paulina is absent due to cultural reasons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1007531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase leather.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Irma\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julieta Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13131.3,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.9,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133077},{"amount":550,"local_amount":3751.8,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3800.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749889},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243373},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.9,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516241},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.9,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441177},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495127}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T04:02:40Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":395310,"name":"Araba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Araba sells a local drink popularly known as Awusa beer at Krofofordo near Abura.

She is not afraid of work and is always happy seeing the positive side of life.  She is married to Arturo, who is 28 years old, and they have two children, Gino who is 17 and Ingrid who is 15.  Jessica lives beside her family in her own home and works hard daily since she wants to bring her family a better quality of life.  Jessica's job consists of selling food.  Early in the morning she goes to the market looking for the freshest ingredients and the most select items in order to bring forth a good product.  Once she returns home she prepares everything and goes out to sell to her clients who are very loyal since they know that her flavors are good and she treats her clients the best.  She does all of this work on her own at home.  She has been doing this work for one year.  Before that she worked selling groceries but that job was never-ending.  She likes what she does now since it permits her to have some free time.  It is going well for her as she is generating good income for her family.  Her plans for the future include opening a restaurant in her house, but she knows it is a process that will take a long time so for now she just wants to continue consolidating and growing a little bit the variety of dishes that she offers to her customers.  This will be her third credit with MFP, and she is hoping that with your help she will be able to reach her goals.  For her part, she promises to complete her scheduled payments and continue being a punctual group member like she was with her previous credit.  With the first loan she met other members of the communal bank and she knows that they are all very responsible and committed, and for that reason she is very happy to belong to such a good group.  With the requested loan of 2000 Peruvian soles, she will buy non-perishable ingredients, so that she will have them in stock, since during the rainy season like right now prices go up a lot and don't allow for good earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1007551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Since youth, he apprenticed with a master craftsman who made traditional chests. These chests are household objects and are used by Tajiks to store a bride's dowry, and also serve as a gift for a daughter when she gets married. After six months of training, Damir began manufacturing the chests on his own. In the beginning, things were difficult due to limited clientele. However, after working for one year, Damir acquired his own customers who regularly place orders for his chests. He makes a high-quality product and uses good wood, as well as a variety of ornaments and designs to decorate the chests' fronts. Using this loan, Damir would like to buy three cubic meters of lumber to increase

She is the mother of 7 children who she raised until they were grown-up. Now she only has one child at home, 14 year old Kaori. She has always lived alongside Armando, her husband, with whom she has worked to be able to offer a good education and upbringing to their children. Many years ago, Reyna had a good and prosperous business selling groceries. She had a very large and well-stocked store. Unfortunately, she had an illness that left her bedridden for a long time and so her business fell and she could no longer run it. As a result, 18 years ago, she decided to start a new business, one that she wouldn't have to work at all the time, but rather one that would enable her to rest. This is how she started to work in her new business that, at the start, she only did at the weekends. With time, she started working on alternating days. She works selling patasca (a soup from the mountains). In our city, there are many people from this part of out country and they very often go in search of dishes that are prepared the way that they like, with good seasoning and well made. She has been running this new business for 18 years and her husband helps her. \r\nThe business is going very well and she has good sales that bring her a good income. For the future, she'd like to grow her business and make a greater variety of dishes and so better serve her customers. This will be her fourth loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support as she feels more sure that she can move her business forward. For her part, she promises once more to continue being good at making her repayments. She is very happy to work alongside the community bank members as they are all very united and responsible. \r\nShe will use the $950 she is requesting to buy ingredients and supplies to continue her business and to prepare a greater variety of dishes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1007572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients and supplies to make a greater variety of dishes.

Her principal agricultural activity is planting corn and potatoes on her own agricultural land. As she has few parcels, she plants on a small scale. But this does not discourage her. She knows that she has to advance for her children. For this reason, during the agricultural season she works as a laborer on other plantings, where they pay her a daily amount of money. But, as she is an ingenious woman, she buys animals such as sheep and pigs, which she fattens and sells in the market that takes place in her city on Sundays. She also sells her harvests, and in this way she obtains a larger income. \"I can't be without doing anything, I have to work on something,\" she mentions. For this reason she also knits wool sweaters with her own hands. This is going very well, and a number of people have placed orders with her. In addition, she works on government projects in her district, where they pay her a monthly salary. In this way she can offer everything necessary to her children. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is very happy to have financial support, since she has always shown that she is responsible with her payments. In addition, she is pleased to be part of her association (communal bank), since all the members are responsible and united people.\r\n\r\nOn receiving her support, Domitila will invest the money she
