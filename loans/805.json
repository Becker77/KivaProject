In 2000 while looking for a source of financial support for her family Burul started her business in field work and animal husbandry. She used a starting capital amount of 10,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle. Burul was able to develop her business with a monthly income of around 10,000 som. At this time her business has three milk cows, ten sheep and one horse as well as 1,04 hectares of arable land with clover which is used as a fodder for her livestock. With the goal to further develop her business Burul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep for fattening.

She often works from home, or when a customer wants her to go to their home, she does not hesitate to go.\r\n\r\nShe is doing very well in her work, and she likes it because she is having fun while making money. She has now increased her range and sells secondhand clothing as well, in different communities around the city. Every day Marli demonstrates that she is a woman who is not afraid of hard work and wants to progress. She has plans that in time she will have a place where she can serve her customers in comfort. This will be her seventh loan with MFP, and she is very happy at being offered this financial support to increase her working capital. She knows she must be very responsible, and above all very punctual. She is happy to belong to the communal bank, and sees them as very supportive. With the 1200 Soles requested, she will buy more merchandise to offer a greater range of innovative designs to customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1007557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T08:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T08:10:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":191.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":205.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":217.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":182.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386555},{"amount":136.43,"local_amount":363.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":366.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099680},{"amount":6.79,"local_amount":18.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713817},{"amount":77.09,"local_amount":205.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":206.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202710},{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":213.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":214.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098390},{"amount":81.74,"local_amount":217.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":219.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401184}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T00:23:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":392973,"name":"Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia, es una se\u00f1ora que esta enferma y perdi\u00f3 la pierna por la diabetes, ella tiene ingresos con el apoyo de su esposo ya que trabajan elaborando ropa deportiva.\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para continuar su fisioterapia, y de esta forma aliviar su dolor para seguir apoyando a su familia.\nSilvia, es casada y tiene dos hijos viven en casa propia en la zona Obispo Bosque de la ciudad de La Paz.\nEs la segunda vez que trabaja junto a IMPRO y  la segunda vez junto a KIVA.\n","en":"Silvia is a woman who suffers from health problems and lost the use of her leg as a result of diabetes.

She lives in the house she inherited from her parents in the city of El Tambo, where she takes care of her three daughters.  For five years she has been active in the art of embroidery which she started after a friend taught her.  Now she embroiders at home where she can comfortably take care of the house and attend to her children.  She also grows alfalfa which she sells wholesale.  She has no fixed work schedule but is constantly embroidering because the complexity of the work and thickness of the design on the fabric means it takes up to a month to make a typical garment admired by her customers which they buy and pay for in cash.  The most profitable season for business is during the local holiday season called the festival of Saint James which is widely celebrated in the region.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to increase her production of embroidered skirts and hire people to help with production.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Victorianas\" and this is her sixth loan through MFP.  She is very happy with the financial support and always has been responsible in her payments.  She enjoys being part of the communal bank because all the members are responsible, supportive people.  \r\n\r\nIf Victoria receives your support she will use the loan to buy thread and fabric for her embroidery products.

The couple have three children who they care for in their own home in the town of Yacuraquina.\r\n\r\nJulia started working as a very good farmer but she always dreamed of being a saleswoman and having her own business.  The farm work was tiring and sometimes she suffered many losses as the bad weather would make her lose crops.  For this reason, she saved up the money she needed to open a business buying and selling clothing in different sizes, colors and price-ranges.  She sells these products in her own village.  During the week, she travels to a nearby city where she buys fashionable clothing and takes it back to her village.  Owing to the distance, this is not an easy journey to make and there are no clothing stores in her village.  This means that her business does very well.  Julia's husband works providing a public transport service in a motorcycle taxi that he acquired a short time ago.  During the day he transports local people from Pampas to different places in the area.\r\n\r\nNow Julia would like to increase her capital and buy new clothing for her business. This will her first loan from MFP and she is very happy to have financial support.  She has always shown herself to be responsible in making her payments.  She enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.

He is a single man who is devoted to his family.  Over the years he managed to acquire a car which he uses to provide a public transport service, covering the routes between Hualahoyo and the city center.  He carries out his work from Monday to Saturday.  On Sundays he rests after a week of hard work.  He says that he makes more profits during the school term because his customers are mainly school children.  Now that they are on vacation, he doesn't make so much profit.  He is keenly waiting for the school year to start again.  \"I like to care for my nieces and nephews as if they were my own children\", he says.  For this reason, he would like to have a stable job in the future with social benefits and also a pension later down the line.  With this security, he would like to start building his own home and form a family.  He will take the first step by acquiring a new driver's license which he needs to work for a well-known mine in his town.\r\n\r\nThis is Idilio's first loan from MFP.  He is very happy to have financial support and he has always shown himself to be responsible in meeting his payments.  He enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.

They sell it to them wholesale.  Liseth also sells all kinds of clothing.  She makes her sales in the afternoons when she has time free and on days when she doesn't accompany her husband to sell fish.  They have been in this business for more than five years and it is a business that Liseth learned from her dad who is also in this line of work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fish and clothing.

Early in the morning she goes to the nearest market\u2014and sometimes straight to the wholesale market\u2014and buys the freshest vegetables and the healthiest meat for her dishes. Once at home, she cleans the vegetables and grinds the meat, seasons the ingredients and keeps an eye on the food, while her secret condiments penetrate the meat and give it its delicious taste, until the plates are ready to cook. As soon as the cooking is under way, Lili writes small notices with the name of the dishes she is about to offer during the day. She has been in this business for the past twelve years and is working with her husband, although he suffers a bit from declining health and cannot support his wife as much as she would like him to do. Lili really likes what she does, because it gives her a better financial situation and allows her to do the various household chores. She expects her business to continue its growth and would like to have better premises, where she could serve her customers more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. She expects to continue their collaboration to pursue her goals, and for her part she promises to pay the installments on time, just as she did with her previous loan.

Like all good Peruvians, she likes typical Peruvian food; one of her favorites is Parrillada (barbecued meat). Veronica is the mother of 2 children, aged 10 and 12, who are in school. She loves them very much and they are her reason to be and to continue getting ahead.    \r\n\r\nWith much effort and dedication, she was able to save some money and she now has a business selling tamales and humitas, both made with milled corn, seasoning made from spices, and pork, among other ingredients. Her seasoning is so good that the majority of her clients come back for more.

She's pleasant and happy, too.  She lives with her partner, Wilder, who is a teacher and father of her three children, Wendy, 18, Neyer, 16, and Gary, 2, all of whom she loves dearly.  They live comfortably together in their own house that they worked very hard to buy.  In the mornings Daysi sells meals like juanes [seasoned rice wrapped in a green bijao leaf], chicken soup, soft drinks, etc.  She has a stand set up in front of a business where lots of local teachers pass by and she provides them with great service starting very early.\r\n\r\nDaysi started out more than four years ago with a private loan that allowed her to get her ingredients and so far she has worked with the support of her daughter, who serves customers.  Daysi feels her business is sufficiently profitable because it provides healthy profits and a busy location.  She decided to start her business because she had an accident on the river in which she lost the boat she used for her transportation service and she needed to have income to support the family.  So now, given the good results she's getting, she wants to keep and maintain her business.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Daysi's second loan with MFP.  She's very glad to know that she'll get financial support because it will make her feel secure in moving ahead with her business.  She plans to invest the 1500 soles in ingredients for meals.  Prices are going up so she'll look for better prices to increase  profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1007668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients and supplies for food preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daysi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":177.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.64,"local_amount":121.66,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386561},{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":137.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099698},{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":136.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713833},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":141.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202727},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":144.28,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":148.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401199},{"amount":119.59,"local_amount":311.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":321.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455594},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":72.51,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451365},{"amount":35.25,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446538},{"amount":65.84,"local_amount":171.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":176.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052575},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":177.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":183.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189144}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T23:38:31Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":395886,"name":"Dzidjogan","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Djidjozan est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 33 ans.

She decided to help one of her aunts with her business until she could raise enough money to continue her education. After some years she raised some capital, but after consulting her aunt about her plight, she advised her to establish her own business instead of going back to school. Since she had some business experience, she decided to take her aunt's advice and open her own shop. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL to buy four cartons of assorted children\u2019s slippers (450,000 SLL), three cartons of ladies' sandals (650,000 SLL), and two cartons of ladies' slippers (550,000 SLL). The balance of the loan will be used for transportation. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 700,000 SLL.

He does his work in a small rented space at the entrance to a shoe store, where he gives his customers quick and friendly service and is very much in demand.  He began three years ago with his own capital, buying a sewing machine for shoemaking, and has worked alone up to the present.  He considers his business quite profitable because of the profits it yields him.  He also saw the opportunity to generate income for himself, because this service was scarce in that area.\r\n\r\nBefore starting his business he had financial problems because he was unemployed.  Besides liking the work, he looked for alternatives to be able to support his family.  Consequently, seeing the profits and the good results he is having now, he wants to continue his business and in the future open a shoemaking workshop.\r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan with the MFP institution, for which he hopes for your collaboration so he can continue with his goals.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 3000 PEN he will invest in buying materials to repair shoes, such as glue, thread, and others, as well as shoemaking materials such as soles, leather, and others.

","en":"Kaiyrkul is 58 years old, married and raising two grandsons. Her family's primary business is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1993 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS), today yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Kaiyrkul's business has two dairy cows, five sheep and one horse.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Kaiyrkul requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep. This would allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, making the best capital investment, in her

Then, they started to cover the ground with plastic by building small greenhouses.  Due to the changes in prices and seasons (early vegetables are more profitable to sell), they now have the need to build a large greenhouse, but do not have their own means to do so.  Olga is requesting a loan in the sum of 10,000 hryvnia to install a large greenhouse for tomatoes.

When she took her first steps in business, she focused on selling underwear.  She was studying at the time and it was easier for her to do this.  When she got married in 1980 her husband, who had a lot of experience (because he used to work in a store,) shared his knowledge with her and encouraged her to start her own business.  She gradually bought sheets and toiletries which she sold to her first customers who were neighbors.  She did very well.  With her savings, she acquired display cabinets one by one and started to diversify her product range until she turned the business into what it is today a 'general store' where, in addition to a variety of merchandise, she also sells food, provisions, soft drinks, etc.  Right now, her wish is to continue growing her business and this is why she has requested a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy school supplies and food products in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that it is the first school term of the year which is a good time to sell these products.

Two years ago her father began an internet caf\u00e9 business which he later gave to her so that she could earn her own income, pay for her university education, and become more independent. Her business has gotten ahead because she meets the virtual communication needs of her community since very few people have computers or technological means which today are absolutely necessary for everyone. For that reason, everyone from students to housewives come to this business and pay for the services that Chadya offers, like internet work, fun games, special offers, communication through social networks, etc. Her goal is to expand and in the future have a branch in another neighborhood of the city that also needs it. Her main challenge is that before growth demands it, she needs to have more computers and a larger space because that which she has is tight. This is just the reason why she\u2019s applied for a Kiva loan which she will use for improvements to her shop and to move a wall which will give her more space in order to bring in more equipment that will meet the growing demand of her clientele.

Thanks to his last loan, he increased his working capital and, therefore, was able to use the freed-up funds from sales for continued expansion of his business.  Andrey's competitive advantage is the fact that he has a wide selection of spare parts at minimal prices compared to competing market neighbors.

At home, his family kept livestock and grew various agricultural crops from spring to autumn.  He also stopped going to Russia and began helping them to breed cattle.  Currently, thanks to our support, Hurshed has seven cows.  He plans to buy another pair of cows before spring after obtaining this loan.  He will sell them after fattening them up or when the time comes to sell livestock, and will use the resulting profit to plant cucumbers, tomatoes and cabbage, and also melon crops on a leased plot of land.

Tolibjon is involved in making furniture and various national tables.  He has a large order to make national tables, which are small and low.  Many use this type of table in the winter to heat up a room by covering it with a blanket.  Tolibjon's wife stays home and raises their child.  Tolibjon started this business one year ago and already has many clients.  He is very grateful to Arvand for the financial support because he previously bought wood with credit, which was expensive.

She lives with 60-year-old Dimas, with whom she has five children - Adriana, aged 14, Susan, aged 8, Deydra, aged 4, Patrick, aged 3 and the youngest, Fernando, aged 1 and a half. They live in a house she owns and she works very hard to improve her family's living conditions.\r\nEvery day, after taking care of her home chores, Doris goes out to the streets of her town where she searches for new customers or closes deals with the old customers, with whom she has been working for a long time. She sells cleaning products, both for house cleaning and for personal hygiene. She does business on credit or cash, depending on how the customer wishes to obtain her excellent products. She has been in this line of work for five years and she does it alone. It's going very well, since she gained a lot of customers along the way, thanks to the excellent service she provides. She's always friendly and facilitates everything for the customers when they purchase one of her products. She hopes to continue having the same success she has had so far and to keep on expanding her business. In the future she would like to set up a grocery store so that she can increase her merchandise and make higher sales. This will be her second loan with MFP, so she hopes to get your collaboration in order to keep on pursuing her goals. On the other hand, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely and responsible fashion. Furthermore, she's very glad to be a part or her communal bank, since all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.

She's married to 40-year-old Gerson, with whom she has four underage children - Paulo, aged 15, Liz, aged 10, Jenifer, aged 7, and the youngest, Jazmin, aged 3. She works very hard because she wishes to improve their living conditions. They live together in a house they own, where they share the good things and face the difficulties that come their way. Elda's work is selling regional food. Every day she goes out to the sidewalk in front of her home and sets up the tables, chairs and all the supplies she needs in order to start selling. Every day she gets a lot of customers who come searching for the delicious dishes she prepares with her own hands which are very skilled at seasoning. The most important thing is that she offers all kinds and varieties of dishes, from the most common to the most rare ones. Her customers always find what they search for and leave satisfied, because she always greets them all with special service and a beautiful smile. She has been in this line of work for three years and during this time she learned that a well-treated customer is one who will come back often.\r\nShe remembers when she got her start in this business. Because they had a low income, she decided to start this business without neglecting her home and, most of all, her children. She currently has many plans, but what she wants for now is to consolidate her business and to begin expanding it in the future. This will be her fifth loan with MFP. She's very glad to know she will have financial support, because this way she will feel more confident as she moves forward with her work. Besides, she enjoys being a part of her communal bank, since all of the members are responsible and very supportive people. With the requested amount of 3.000 soles, she will purchase ingredients so that she can continue preparing her various food dishes. Also, she will invest part of it in getting new kitchenware and providing more security for her venue."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1007546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase food making supplies and to renew her kitchenware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":478.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":476.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":513.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":532.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":545.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":169.94,"local_amount":453.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":456.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386553},{"amount":179.32,"local_amount":478.19,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":481.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099678},{"amount":143.23,"local_amount":381.95,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":384.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713816},{"amount":228.08,"local_amount":608.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":612.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202709},{"amount":199.86,"local_amount":532.96,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098389},{"amount":28.85,"local_amount":76.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401183},{"amount":175.72,"local_amount":468.58,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":471.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869237}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T19:32:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:21:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":396043,"name":"Akouemevo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe AKOUEMEVO est form\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

Her main clientele are the many employees at the company where her daughter works, who have begun to trust, little by little, in her ability to make delicious meals. Ferlina employs someone to help transport the meals, while she is in full production. The results of her business present a level of sales that allow her to cover her operating costs. Her income is in cash, though she has some monies still owed to her because although she generally accepts only cash, some of her most loyal clients pay by credit. The toughest part is getting enough work capital together to improve her process, that\u2019s why she is requesting her 1st Kiva loan through the Maria Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan, she will buy an industrial stove, kitchen utensils and a large volume of basic ingredients. This is an exciting investment because she plans on buying product in large volume and by cash, which will lower her production costs. She wants to be competitive and well prepared with a strong business infrastructure and good offerings for her

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is in a common-law marriage and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health center.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Francisca was not present in the photograph for cultural reasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1008316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy rugs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remigia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Sonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15151.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1894.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133081},{"amount":278.11,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749893},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243377},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516245},{"amount":278.11,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441181},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495129},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260706},{"amount":278.28,"local_amount":1894.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1909.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490441}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T05:55:29Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":395371,"name":"Airtime Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clever is a 34 year old married man from Masvingo, Zimbabwe.

She lives in the city of Pisco, a city that is characterized by beautiful beaches, a warm climate, and one of the most beautiful tourist attractions of our country, the Ballestas Islands and the Candelabro. Santos loves Peruvian food, and one of the dishes that she likes most is the very delicious \"aji de gallina\" (chili pepper chicken, a Peruvian chicken stew). She is a mother and has two children whose ages are 4 and 14 and whom she loves very much and who are her reason for living. For economic reasons, she could only go to school up to the fifth grade of secondary education, but she would have liked to study gastronomy, because she very much likes to cook.\r\n\r\nThanks to her good cooking skill in preparing dishes, she began her business selling one of the Peruvian flagship dishes, the very delicious ceviche, 11 months ago. Santosa gets up very early to go in search of the ingredients to prepare this dish. She works about eight hours a day and can serve about 30 customers a day. She believes that she is doing well in her business because she is a good cook and furthermore, she treats her customers in a kindly manner.\r\n\r\nSantosa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help she will be able to buy a freezer and a display case for the sale of her dishes, which will permit her to store the ingredients that she uses in preparation in an optimal manner and to have more order in showing her products. With it she will continue working and striving to accomplish her greatest dream, \"to have her own business location.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1008339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 31 years old, married and the father of four children who live in Aden, Yemen. His educational background is Bachelor of Commerce.\r\n\r\nAhmed is very hardworking. With much great effort and dedication, he managed to save money and forge his business, which today is a general store. He works around 12 hours daily. He said that without sacrifice, there is no reward and if one wants to get ahead, you have to do what you can. He believes that his business is going well because his family is his best motivation. Additionally, they are very close and all cooperate in order to move forward.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of Php 16,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes to grow the business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Among them are: selling underwear, selling salchipapas, selling washed sand, selling skirts and selling weaving.  \r\n\r\nRufina indicates that she has been working with Pro Mujer for a year and joined the institution when she was invited by one of her friends. At present, she has a knitting business selling sweaters and blankets. She has been doing this for awhile, having learned at a business where she used to work.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her capital. She will buy wool that she will acquire at fairs and later sell in her commercial space. This work allows her to generate resources to support her family. She is married and has three children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the health aspects.  \r\n\r\nIn the photograph Elvira is not shown for cultural reasons.

He is married and has 1 child, age 3 yrs. He has 1 additional dependent who lives with him.  In 1999, Sulaiman established his textiles business. He began his business because at the age of 19 years he went to one of the diamond mining towns known as Kono. However, due to the rebel war in Sierra Leone, they were attacked by rebels, and he fled to Makeni where he started doing petty business with the small amount of money he had by then. \r\n\r\nAfter some years when the business developed, he decided to come to Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, to continue his business until now. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

She earns a minimum of Php 700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 38,000 loan.

She leaves her products on credit, and she collects once a week.  \r\n\r\nShe buys the clothes in the city of Guayaquil, which is where she goes each time she needs merchandise.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Annie is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnnie hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners.

It's only the early wake-up call in the morning that makes her feel tired, but the result at the end of each harvesting season makes her proud of herself. Fatima has also been an Al Majmoua borrower for three cycles, and all her previous loans were invested into her business with impressive results. This time Fatima is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary chemicals, plastic bags and nutrients for her agricultural business.\r\n\r\nYousra is a 44-year-old married woman, mother of two children.

Faridah is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past 4 years, Faridah has been working hard to manage her rearing animals, from which she sells milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to build more rental houses, and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and buy food to feed her family. Faridah hopes that in the future she will be able to become a secretary. \r\n\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Faridah's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1012728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to

He lives together with his wife and two small children in the Vodyanoye village.  Vitalyi is involved in growing early vegetables in his greenhouses.  He has a large plot of land, three big, 80x100 meter greenhouses, and two greenhouses for seedlings.  Vitalyi has been involved in agriculture for 13 years.  He had invested 110,000 hryvnia into his business.  His annual expenses for seeds and plastic amount to 43,000 hryvnia.
