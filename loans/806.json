To provide an income source for her family, Dinara is involved in animal husbandry and farming.  Having started with a sum of 15,000 som (KGS), she was able to develop her business to currently have one dairy cow, one calf, ten sheep and one horse.

She dedicates about 8 hours per day to her work and she can serve up to 30 clients a day. She believes that her business is going well because she is friendly in her attention to her clients and because she offers products in good condition. \r\n\r\nCurrently Maria is very thankful for the loans from Kiva since, thanks to the support that it has provided, she will be able to buy more merchandise for the creation of her spices and so to have more earnings. With it she will continue working to continue fighting and to complete her greatest dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This region is known for its traditional culture and, moreover, for being a few minutes from two of the best beaches in the province which are San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n\r\nIn this location lives Ms. Angie who is 23 years old, is married and the fruit of this relationship is a 1.5 year old son who, since his birth, is her entire life. Her husband is a dump truck driver. \r\n\r\nShe is a young mother and housewife who, in order to obtain her own resources and with this to collaborate on the expenses of the home, dedicates herself to the sale of clothing through a catalogue.  Her manner of sales is door to door and she also sells from her home where her clients come. She works 5 days per week, selling her products on credit and collecting payment each week, or every 15 days, in agreement with what her clients want. Her merchandise is sent to her through Guayaquil, the city in which she was born, where her family lives. She has spent more than 4 years on her business and it is going very well, in spite of her tiny son who has made it very difficult for her to complete her travels, but she keeps progressing because she knows that it is for the good of her family. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy pants, shirts, tank tops, blouses and clothing for children. She has spent 3 years in the Banco Comunal and she likes it because the loans are quick and without too many restrictions.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1008588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy pants, shirts, tank tops, blouses and clothing for children.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Charapoto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1320,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":132}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":265,"local_amount":264,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034094},{"amount":397.5,"local_amount":396,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646175},{"amount":265,"local_amount":264,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321255},{"amount":265,"local_amount":264,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208855},{"amount":132.5,"local_amount":132,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":132.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335189}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T00:37:58Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":393580,"name":"Serenidad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres de nombre Serenidad, se conform\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2009, gracias a la Sra.

successful clients of our organization and has been working with us since 2006.  He is married and has three children.  At the onset of his credit history, he obtained a loan in the amount of 300 somoni, which he used to buy one bag of rice and gradually increased his product turnover to 7000 somoni.  He buys rice from dekhan farmers, who deliver several bags of rice to him at a wholesale price.  He sells the rice during the course of two weeks and then buys new product again.  Currently, Aliboy has about 800 kilograms of rice, which is in high demand among the residents because the Tajik people love the national plov

She has a son who is 6 years old, whom she dreams will become a successful professional and with this in mind she works from day to day in her own business which she started after being unemployed.

In search of an financing source for her family, Gulmira started her own business in animal husbandry and farming ten years ago with an initial sum of 40,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, today her livestock business yields about 20,000 som per month from sales of milk and milk products.  The earnings from the business allow Gulmira to pay for her son's education at the Medical Institute.  In order to further expand her business, Gulmira requested a loan in the sum of 75,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow and ewes.

Her future goal is to expand her shop in order to organize herself better and sell more quantities. Her biggest challenge is to have enough disposable cash to keep her shop stocked since some clients use credit and only pay every two weeks.

She initially bought retail for 1 package of chicken and sold from home, but the market was growing so she was looking for new options. From the recommendation of a friend, she acquired a code to make purchases using a credit allowance at home from one of the largest suppliers of these products.\r\n\r\nGradually, she was extending its business to other sectors such as shops and various small shops that provide food. In her home she has a freezer that is 700 pounds, 2 scales for weight. Sandra's goal is to put a room in her home to accommodate the business and add other meats. Currently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from the Fundaci\u00f3n.  With the loan, Sandra will buy chickens in bulk to increase sales and obtain discounts of about 50%.  This is precisely what guarantees her success in this

In search of a source of funding for her family,  in 2006 Baktygul started her agriculture business with a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Batygul's hard work, today her land holdings of 1 acre planted with potatoes bring in around 10,000-12,000 som (KGS) per month.  In addition, to cover daily family expenditures, Baktygul purchases scrap metal that she then turns in to a factory.  In order to further grow her business, Baktygul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase potato seeds.

She sells cheese, dairy products, and gelatins. She is married and has a 1 year-old child who she hopes will become a successful person. Her husband is a public taxi driver and between the two of them they earn the income for their household. She began learning commercial business when she was 16 years old and was working in stores to help out her widowed mother. So, three years ago when she thought of a way to earn money on her own, she had no doubts about opening her own business, also because at the same time she needed to take care of tasks in her own home. She obtains her dairy products from the department of Magdalena and they are very natural and fresh, which has allowed her to gain a good number of customers. She is currently requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy cheese at wholesale price.

Her suppliers are stores where she makes purchases in cash.  Her assets are her machines and accounts receivable and she has the financial support of her spouse.  Her accounts receivable rotate their inventories quickly, so her portfolio is well managed.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for this loan, her first with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, so that she can purchase supplies to fulfill her contract and a sewing machine to improve her production times and the quality of her work.

He grows tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Alexander has five large greenhouses and two separate ones for seedlings. All the greenhouses are heated. Alexander has been growing vegetables for ten years and has approximately 200,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) invested in the business. He spends about 84,000 UAH annually on seeds and polyethylene sheeting to insulate the greenhouses. Alexander needs another 20,000 UAH to purchase coal to keep the greenhouses heated. He has set up a heating system in each greenhouse, but it requires a lot of coal, which is getting more and more expensive each year in Ukraine. Alexander believes there is a good future for his business in this region of the country. Near his home there are two plots of land for sale. Alexander hopes to purchase the land for his business and to continue expanding.

She lives in a traditional family in the Darsalam neighborhood in S\u00e9gou.  For social reasons, she never attended school, but rapidly became involved in money-making activities with her aunt who was selling clothes and shoes.  After  several years of apprenticeship by her side, she started to work independently.  She has been working at her business for 9 years and enjoys a good experience and a large number of customers.  Her strength comes from the fact that she knows this field of activity very well, but also from the fact that she practices very affordable prices.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her business and to generate more profits, she is requesting a new loan.  She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 48 months, and has already duly repaid 4 individual loans.  This is her fifth individual loan.

It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also sells basic ingredients in her stall for additional income.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEstelita dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1013538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-25T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-26T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1925.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275649},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3208.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998015},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1925.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606555},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2566.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095412}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T14:48:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":396429,"name":"Noor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noor is a 25-year-old women committed to succeeding and helping her family.

Because of this, he wants to stock the store by buying basic staple items but he does not have enough capital to make these purchases and this is why he took a loan of 80,000 YER from AMB that will allow him to buy  items such as rice, beans, soft drinks, and cheese to increase the variety of items he stocks for his customers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he is hoping that he can provide his children with opportunities to study in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic staple items such as rice, beans, soft drinks, and cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-25T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-26T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Majd","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563375},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050520},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072061},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266932},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320270},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341204},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310563},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918897},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331051169},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8221.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339441197}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T18:09:20Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":396433,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marilyn, 47, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines.

She is married to Alfredo, a driver, and mother of two children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n        \r\nJean operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates a small barber shop for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJean hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a widow with three children, the youngest of whom is still of preschool age. Kairykul worked as a math teacher in secondary school for a long time, but after her husband\u2019s death in 2008, searching for an income source for her family, she launched her livestock business, with a starting capital of 25,000 KGS. Thanks to Kairykul\u2019s hard work, her farm, which now counts three calves and a cow, brings in about 13,000 KGS a month from the sales of milk as well as dairy and meat products. The revenues from her business allow Kairykul to pay for her son\u2019s law school studies. In order to grow her business further, Kairykul turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Parnters\u201d for a loan in the amount of 120,000 KGS in order to buy calves for fattening and later resale. Kairykul plans to invest her revenues into expanding her

In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jane's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

The loan will be used to buy more flour for making bread, and will help Ronah to generate greater profits and buy food to feed her family. Ronah hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nRonah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

city in eastern Sierra Leone. This group of teachers has come to Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan.

","en":"Lira is 54 yeas old and married. Lira worked for many years as an elementary school teacher in the village of Khan-Burgo, and she is now retired. Seeking a source of income for her family, Lira started her own animal husbandry business ten years ago by purchasing one dairy cow. Thanks to her hard work, Lira's business now numbers two cows, one calf, one mare, and 15 sheep. Lira also farms two hectares of irrigated land, where she grows beans and potatoes. In order to further expand her business, Lira requested a loan of 70,000 soms (KGS) from the Bai Tushum & Partners Company to purchase livestock.

He is married and his spouse is a housewife. He has two children, aged 18 and 13 years.

The balance of Le10,000 will be used to pay labourers. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 720,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Alpha plans to complete his building construction, provide quality education and buy a delivering van.  He has the belief and conviction that in acquiring the loans his shop will expand more than before.  His major problem is the fluctuation in foreign currency which causes increase in prices.  He serves 20 customers each day.  His business is popular because of his customer care strategies.  His suppliers are located in Freetown and he transports his items through public vehicles.  He buys at least three times per month.  \r\n\r\nSome of the profit is ploughed back into the business and some is used on his building construction.

She is married to a businessman and has 2 children, aged 19 and 17 years.  They are both in school.  In 2004, Ejartu established her skirt, party dress, and under wear business. She began her business because her parents were against girl child education and at  6 years she was given to foster parents who likewise had no respect for female education.  They were mainly engaged in business.  After Ejartu was fully mature, she was handed in marriage to a businessman.  Her husband gave her some money to start her own business.  She now enjoys doing business and she has almost solved all her problems. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,145,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.   Ejartu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans.  Now she would like a new loan in order to purchase the following items: skirts - 2 bales @ Le1,450,000, party dresses - 1 bale @ Le1,100,000, and under vests - 10 dozen @ Le50,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 429,000.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ejartu plans to build a house, educate her children to university level, which opportunity she did not have, and have a shop on her own.  She feels happy about taking this loan because it will help her business to grow.  Her major challenge is sometimes she buys a bale that contains spoiled clothing.  She serves 15 customers each day.  Her business is popular because she sells quality used clothing.  She is only assisted by her children.  Her suppliers are in Freetown and she transports her goods by public vehicle.  She buys twice in a month.  She uses the profit of the business to repay her loan.  She wants her business to expand and this will be accomplished by proper utilization of her capital. She is hard working and honest.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1013799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy skirts, party dresses and under vests -","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T03:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T03:00:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ejartu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":562500},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974908},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815470},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444524},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537234},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284702},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338256},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354646},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":562500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":564375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315575722}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T14:23:49Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:11:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":394938,"name":"Maria Libia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda  tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y no tiene hijos, actualmente vive en el domicilio de sus padres a quienes apoya econ\u00f3micamente y el cual esta ubicado en un caser\u00edo rural perteneciente al distrito de Mochum\u00ed y el mismo a la Provincia de Lambayeque de donde se estima una distancia aproximada de 1.20 Horas.
