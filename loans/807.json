This situation means that in the face of the difficulty of finding a paying job, the women need to become their own employers. In the case of Irma, she had already participated in her first loan cycle at a Banco Mujer. Upon moving to Jalaca, she continued with this business, but it presented the drawback that, given the limitations of her capital, she was not able to construct a farrowing pen, which is a space inside the pigsty where they put the recently born little pigs once they are being fed by the mother pig, because the little pigs can't be in the space with the mother pig all day because they run the risk of being crushed by their own mother, as has already happened. Thus there is an urgent need to do this construction, as well as to have growth feed concentrate, since at this time she has sixteen little pigs that need this food to be able to achieve adequate growth. At the same time, they need vaccines to protect them from diseases.\r\n\r\nThe goal that Irma Rosa has set for herself is to be able to have three sows, so that in this way she can be taking some thirty little pigs to sell every six months, which will permit her to make the monthly loan payments, capitalize her business, and be able to help support her household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1010803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to construct a farrowing pen and buy pigs, feed concentrate, and vaccines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Corredores","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":226586.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":249244.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":274169.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":453.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":498.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":548.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":454,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":230632,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301396814},{"amount":1046,"local_amount":523000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":531368,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347072958}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T12:42:20Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":394911,"name":"Carlos Humberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos Humberto, tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, desde hace 4 a\u00f1os vive con su esposa en la aldea Santa Cruz de Yojoa.\nCarlos ha sido agricultor desde muy peque\u00f1o, trabajando con su padre adquiri\u00f3 mucha experiencia de varios cultivos, principalmente en el cultivo de Yuca.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosalina hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Like all good Peruvians, she loves Peruvian food, and one of her favorite dishes is the delicious chupe de camarones.\r\n\r\nNelly works at her business selling shoes.  She spends about 10 hours a day at her business and she can serve up to 15 customers daily.  She is very charismatic and above all attentive with her customers, which is why she thinks her business is going well.  She also puts a lot of effort into getting ahead every day so that her children can have a good quality of life, as they are her reason for living.\r\n\r\nNelly is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is because of their help that she will be able to buy more merchandise, especially shoes for the school year.  This will allow her to have a wider variety of products and thus increase her earnings.  She will keep struggling and applying herself to grow every day and be able to achieve her greatest dream: to see her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1009478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

and is raising a four year-old son. As a source of income for her family, Aizhan is engaged in animal husbandry and field crop cultivation. Begun in 2007 with the purchase of five sheep, her business now brings in about 15,000 soms (KGS) per month. Aizhan's business currently numbers three dairy cows, one horse, and ten sheep. In order to further develop her business, Aizhan has requested  a loan of 120,000 soms (KGS) from the Bai Tushum & Partners Company to purchase additional livestock.

She has been operating this farm business for 14 years. 60,000 hrivnas has been invested in the business. Annual expenditures on seeds and tape come to 29,000 hrivnas. Svetlana needs an additional 20,000 hrivnas to construct a greenhouse, purchase seeds and plastic film, and to prepare for the coming growing season. Svetlana has long dreamed of erecting an additional greenhouse, but she hasn't been able to find the funds for doing this. This year Svetlana purchased new arches for the new greenhouse. But now she needs money for installing them. Svetlana is divorced, and lives alone. But she is accustomed to doing everything herself. Right now she is building a new house, has installed gas in it, and recently purchased some land at the edge of the village, and plans to put up two more greenhouses eventually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1015217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to erect a greenhouse, puchase seeds and plastic film and prepare for the coming growing season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Blagoveschenka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2500,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20015,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518694}],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T21:14:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":394223,"name":"Llapallanchis Purisunchis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLLAPALLANCHIS PURISUNCHIS\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de San Jeronimo, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco. \n\n\nLa socia Sra.

She is married to Antonio, a vendor, and mother of three children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNormita operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is to buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a small profit. Her products are clothes, sandals, bags and other such-like products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNormita hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1014526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for merchandise and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Normita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2424.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275662},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998023},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606563},{"amount":113.34,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095420},{"amount":28.33,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359045}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T01:51:02Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":396921,"name":"Gaudiosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gaudiosa is forty-one years old and lives in the Philippines.

After graduating from high school seven years ago he decided to initiate a kiosk business. As the only son, Yakob is responsible for helping his mother generate income for their daily needs. He spent his own money to buy kiosk stocks. He sells daily-use basic items e.g., instant noodle, biscuits, sugar, coffee, shampoo, etc. \r\n\r\nLately, Yakob is thinking of adding stock to his kiosk such as cigarettes, instant noodles, snacks, cooking oil, etc. as the more goods he sells then the more income he can earn.  He needs capital assistance to do so. \r\n\r\nHe met a loan officer and received some information on the individual lending program provided by TLM. He then was interested in joining the program and requested a loan of 4,000,000 Rupiah (IDR). Yakob is hoping that TLM will approve his loan application soon.

She is married to Rudy, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

She works in the city's central market where she sells office supplies.  Her shop is located on a central aisle, which clearly contributes to her high levels of sales.  Olga has already been in this business for more than 5 years.  Her monthly income is around 6,500 hryven.  \r\n\r\nNot long ago, the neighboring shopkeepers decided to sell their shop.

She is married to a driver and has 2 children aged 6 years and 8 months old. She has no additional dependents.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Zainab established her Maggi (a product for enhancing the flavour of soups and stews), rood season, and cooking oil business. She began her business because her husband, who was supporting the home strongly, was relieved of his job. She was so dependent on him for survival as she didn't learn a trade, so as a result, she went to her elder brother who advised her to go in to business. Her brother gave her some capital to start the business so that she can also be supportive of her husband. Since then, she worked hard to improve on her capital up to this time. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

It is well known that Peru is known for having the most delicious food in the world, and one of the dishes Fiorella likes a lot is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" [dried potatoes with meat and sauce served with pasta].  Fiorella is the mother of a five-year-old child who is in the first year of school.\r\n\t\t\r\nFiorella works selling snow cones, \"papa rellena\" [stuffed potatoes], and \"salchipollo\" [fried potatoes with chicken].  She works at this job about nine hours a day.  In one day she is able to serve up to 25 customers.  She believes that it is going well for her in her business because she treats her customers well.\r\n\r\nFiorella is very grateful to the lenders because with their help she will be able to buy utensils for preparing her dishes and an electric snow-cone machine.  With this improvement she will be able to serve her customers faster and have the necessary tools, and so continue working to realize her big dream: \"To give her son a career and to grow as a micro-entrepreneur.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1007695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy utensils and an electric snow-cone machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiorella Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":152.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":176.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":182.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.03,"local_amount":152.08,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993978},{"amount":58.76,"local_amount":156.7,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":157.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601876},{"amount":18.86,"local_amount":50.3,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090999},{"amount":105.91,"local_amount":282.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":284.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222069},{"amount":66.04,"local_amount":176.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298146},{"amount":68.4,"local_amount":182.41,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350915}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T20:48:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":397103,"name":"Maligie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

He sells paracetamol tabs, malarial drugs, baby food, procaine injections (Novocain: type of anesthesia) and blood tonic. He has been running this business for 15 years. He began his business because he needed a permanent source of income to take care of his family. He works in the business 7 days per week and 18 hours a day. He also earns income from the patients he treats. He says that the main challenge for his business is that most of his customer do not have money for their medical bills.\r\n\r\nIdrissa has requested a loan in order to buy more paracetamol tabs, malarial drugs, baby food, procaine injections, and blood tonic. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve his standard of living and educate his children. In the future, he plans to open a clinic. He appreciates your support.

She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 350,000.

\n\nPreviously, Mariatu was a civil servant, but she retired and went to Ivory Coast to seek a visa to go to the United States. Unfortunately, she was denied one, and when she went back home, there was no job for her. With her remaining money, she opened her provisions and drinks shop in 2006.\n\nWorking six days a week and ten hours a day, Mariatu earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month.

He has already successfully repaid his previous loan and now needs a new loan in order to buy six cartons of luncheon meat for 180,000 SLL, twelve crates of Parrot Bay malt liquor at 48,000 SLL, twenty cartons of margarine for 75,000 SLL and six bags of sugar for 210,000 SLL. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 900,000 SLL. \n\nIn the future, Michael plans to build a house from the proceeds of the business and see that his children receive a university education. He thanks you for your support.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1009174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 6 Catton luncheon meat @ Le.180,000, 12 crates parrot drinks @ Le.48,000,20 Cattons margarine butter @ Le.75,000 and 6 bags of sugar @ Le.210,000.

Ana is a single mother of three children.  Her business consists of making hair products like shampoo, conditioner and anti-frizz serum as well as disinfectant for floors and home surfaces.  Ana purchases chemical products from local distributors to make her products and packs them for distribution.  Her finished products are sold in small grocery stores and in her own home.  In addition, Ana is a dressmaker, sewing clothes and decorative pieces like curtains, bathroom sets and bedspreads. \n\nAna\u2019s most important challenge is to see her children become professionals.  God has given her the strength to work hard as a single mother, to provide for her family and to send her children to study.  She enjoys sewing and making products.  She learned her last one around six years ago and, after completing all her classes, she decided to invest and produce products for hair, body and other uses.  She has received 15 loans with Esperanza and, with her first loan, she bought a sewing machine and started making student uniforms. With this loan, Ana will buy fabric to make bedspreads and bathroom set and chemical products (Sodium chloride, boric acid, menthol, methyl salicylate, glycerin, fruit fragrance, cetyl alcoohol, etc.) for hair and household products.\n\nAna's dream is to have a big factory to produce her chemical-based products and to sell them in other cities and in big department stores.  She thanks you all for your support.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1013122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and chemical products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"El Seybo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.8 -69.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T06:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T06:50:04Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daysy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":83000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6723.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":6406.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6526.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6648.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6772.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6898.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7027.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7158.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7292.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":7428.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7566.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6551.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":174.17,"local_amount":6723.81,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6749.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263296707},{"amount":335.01,"local_amount":12932.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12981.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016061},{"amount":347.63,"local_amount":13420.19,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13470.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276625030},{"amount":546.17,"local_amount":21084.49,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":21163.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476399},{"amount":381.31,"local_amount":14720.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":14775.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287456911},{"amount":365.71,"local_amount":14118.21,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14171.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294550956}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T19:01:21Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":392345,"name":"Roda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roda lives in Yambio.

undergraduate degree at Strathmore University. This is her story:\r\nMy name is Rosemary, a 19-year-old lady from Kenya. I live with my parents and two siblings. My sister is a second-year university student and my brother started high school this year.\r\nI am a student at Strathmore University pursuing a bachelor of business degree in actuarial science. I am currently on my long holiday, which will see me join my second year when I resume class in April this year. Strathmore is one of the leading private universities in Africa offering quality education to its students, which is why I chose to study here.\r\nThis loan will enable me to focus on my studies without the uncertainties of being sent away from school in the course of the semester because of my fees balance and not being allowed to sit for my examinations. The assurance that I will complete my course without any financial setbacks will give me peace and help me concentrate on my classwork.\r\nUpon graduation, I want to venture into the insurance field, especially life insurance and micro-insurance, where I want to apply my acquired skills and also get to learn more on the same. I hope to see an increase in the level of penetration of insurance in Kenya to a high level, probably higher than that in South Africa. Embracing of micro-insurance, especially among low income earners, is one of the best dreams I have for my country. The benefits of this will go a long way in providing a better lifestyle for most people and will also reduce the money spent to cover losses compared to if they had not been insured.\r\nThis loan will help me complete my studies without financial constraints and at the same time enable my parents to educate my other siblings. The repayment mode of the loan makes it possible for one to take up the loan and pay it in time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7975,"image":{"id":1014615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story:\n\nI am Quinter, aged 18 years, from Kenya. I come from a family of 8, I am the fourth born, my three siblings have only high school qualification,one is in high school and the youngest is in primary school. I am the only one pursuing university education. I am in my first year taking an undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Business Information Technology at Strathmore University.\n\nI completed high school with the help of well-wishers in 2010. My excellent performance and improved skills in basketball led me to be called for by the UNICEF Talent Academy where I was exposed to many clubs including an outstanding, high-level performing institution that is Strathmore University. I applied for a sports scholarship, and luckily I was awarded 75% of my tuition fees. My father is having difficulties financing the remaining 25% of the tuition fee.He is not financially stable, and besides that my small business cannot help me raise this money in a stable way.\n\nAt the end of my degree course I dream of being an IT specialist, majoring on networking. Besides that, I wish to have a chance to get my basketball to a professional level, because it has been the virtue of my assistance to my academic progression and it\u2019s my motivator in my struggles.\n\nThrough the Strathmore media I came to know about KIVA and felt the urge to apply for the 4 year maximum tuition loan to help me out of my struggle to raise the 25% of my fees.  With that at hand, I had to consider the thought to seek this loan to help see my dream come true."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1003581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married and has 3 children, all of whom are in school. She also takes care of additional family members (her late brother's children).  Lucy has a business of selling spare parts.  She has been in this business for 10 years, and she works 6 days out of every week. She sells her products in a shop, by means of retail.  \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more spare parts.
