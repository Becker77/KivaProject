Due to the current bad situation in Yemen, he faces difficulty in the lack of gas leading him to sometimes have to close his business for a long time thus he has less profit from his enterprise and his customers are decreasing.\n\nSo he took a youth loan of 300,000 YER from AMB to buy more bakery items such as flour, gas, etc. for his business in order to make bread and distribute it to many shops. \n\n In the future, he hopes to expand his business to purchase another shop and make it a gas cylinder store and also buy a car for transporting his business items.\n\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1013663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy more bakery needs such as flour, gas, etc. in order to make bread to distribute to many shops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Taisyr","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37535},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37495},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":172.04,"local_amount":37535,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":37718.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563378},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050523},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072064},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266935},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320273},{"amount":171.86,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341207},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310566},{"amount":171.85,"local_amount":37495,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37678.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918900}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T19:36:58Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":396479,"name":"Fuad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuad is a 26-year-old man who is always kind-hearted in his everyday life, according to the residents of his neighborhood.

He had some thoughts about further enlarging his business by opening a cafe next to this business selling food to his clients, a commonly sold food eaten as breakfast. \r\n\r\nFuad was in need of a loan to start up the other business and visited one of Al-Amal Bank's branches. He  took a youth loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to pay the rent for the two shops and purchase needed materials like a large amount of white cement.

He has a young family and, hence, has to earn well in order to provide not only for his wife, but to help his retired parents.  This is why, his father and he are involved in breeding goats.  Their village is small, and they do not have a primary job.  Many people mainly go to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan in order to provide for their families.

This group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor, an agricultural area so most of our loans are dedicated to the agriculture sector. Ceferino is running a butcher shop; other members in this group are breeding cattle, working the land, selling animals, etc.\r\n\r\nCeferino makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and their five children. Ceferino is excited to be taking his 15th loan with Esperanza after successfully repaying his previous loans and growing his business.

Maria, a very independent person, hopes to keep making enough to sustain her family and is very proud of her own work so far."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1015319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cement and other supplies for a hardware store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":189.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":193.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":182.44,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":182.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031124},{"amount":185.22,"local_amount":185.22,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":185.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643312},{"amount":189.33,"local_amount":189.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-25T07:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326000},{"amount":193.01,"local_amount":193.01,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-30T08:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":193.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287431327}],"funded_date":"2012-02-27T20:05:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-30T08:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":394501,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Now her customers know her for the tasty dishes that she makes.  She also plants corn from Cuzco on her agricultural land.  This season she only used one parcel because she rented the other land for a good price.  Currently she hopes to obtain a good harvest, since she has worked hard caring for the crop.  Now she wants to increase her livestock, since recently she sold an average of 300 guinea pigs and for next season she needs to stock up on her livestock for sale.

Currently Churek lives with her daughter-in-law and her grandson, while her son is away to Russia to earn money. \r\n\r\nChurek was born into a simple family of a sheep herder. After school she attended Prjewalski co-op institute to earn her degree as a saleswoman. Upon finishing her studies Churek moved to the Moskovski region where she had relatives and started working as a milkmaid in the \"Druzhba\" farming co-op in the Aleksandrovka village. In 1981 she married a tractor driver from the same co-op. The young family received a house from the co-op's administration and Churek's four children were born there. They lived and worked for the co-op for 20 years, raised their children there, slowly purchased their own herd of livestock. After the farming co-op broke apart with the fall of the Soviet Union, they lost their jobs and were forced to sell their livestock and move to the Rovnoe village in Panfilovski region, where they were able to buy a house. Churek's husband started working as a mechanic in \"Shapak\" farming co-op and Churek took care of the house and children. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 Churek and her husband decided to start raising livestock again and purchased a heifer. Their livestock business began with 5,000 som (KGS) and it grew to yield 7,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. In 2010 Churek's husband passed away and she became her family's main provider. Her hard work and determination allowed Churek to continue her husband's business and currently her herd has two milk cows and a heifer. In order to purchase more animals she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). Churek is planning to use the profits from this loan to purchase more animals and in the future save enough money for her grandson's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1016553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Churek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25192.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339093},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":25192.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012180},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25192.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743519},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25192.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013753}],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T00:04:48Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":397671,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 58 years old, married and has nine children.

Chincha was named after the Chincha people, who are known for their advanced knowledge of agriculture and for their maritime exploits.  Today, Chincha is an incredible mix of cultures, with a large Afro-Peruvian population, which comes from the remnants of an indigenous past and the influence of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with other cities close to the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007 when high-magnitude earthquakes struck.  However, it has endured, just as it always has throughout a large part of its history.  In her free time she likes to watch soap operas.  As everyone knows, Peru is famous for having the most delicious food in the world and one of Dionisia's favorite dishes is the wonderful carapulcra con sopa seca.  Dionisia is the mother of four children, all of whom are now adults.\n\nDionisia works selling toasted corn, peanuts, broad beans, and candy.  She does this work for five hours a day and she can serve up to 25 customers in one day.  She believes that her business is going well because she seasons her food well and because she is charismatic with her customers.\n\nDionisia is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is their help that will allow her to buy more merchandise, which will allow her to have fresh ingredients with which to prepare her dishes and keep offering quality products.  This will allow her to keep working toward achieving her greatest dream: to be able to offer other products and to grow as a small businesswoman.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1011210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Its members decided to call it that because in their community, there are a lot of Neen trees, which serve to control diabetes and blood pressure.  This group is made up of three hardworking and nice people with desires to improve and complete their lives. The representative of this group is Mr. Francisco Bruno, an intelligent and hard-working man of 42 years who is happily married to Mrs. Maura Berta, a very nice and hard-working woman with the strength necessary to help her husband with what he needs. They have three children, Berta Sof\u00eda, Eva Maria and Carla Idolina. They are their pride and motivation to fight to continue helping them so the children can achieve their dreams and the parents can give the kids a good education. Better known as Don Chico, Mr. Bruno has been dedicated to the production of limes and bananas since he was five years old.

Therefore, he was encouraged to borrow additional capital.\r\n\r\nAbdulsalam took a loan of 100,000 YER from Alamal Bank, which he will use to purchase mobile recharge cards to sell to his customer

He says that he grows some of the fruit he sells himself and buys the rest in the wholesale food market in a nearby town.  He says that he has been in this business for ten years, since he was very young.  He used to help his parents sell in the markets and streets in different towns.  Janitzio is requesting a loan to buy fruit such as peaches, avocados, blackberries, cauliflowers, lettuce, spinach, carrots, etc.  He says that he will also buy manure and fertilizers because he has an avocado orchard with approximately 50 trees but only 30 are producing.  One of the difficulties that he has is transporting his fruit because it costs a lot to pay somebody to do this.  He would like to have his own vehicle and he is working hard so that he can buy a used truck.  He would also like to continue sowing more avocado plants because this is a good business, and he would love to own cows, pigs and lambs so that he can guarantee his children's future.\r\n\r\nJanitzio is married to Carolina who is a homemaker.

She plans to invest in her business by buying more fruits and vegetables (potatoes, onions, tomatoes, carrots, watermelon, oranges, lemons, avocados, pineapples and more) and hopefully achieve her goal of improving the standard of living of her family.
