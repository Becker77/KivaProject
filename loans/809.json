While her sales have increased, Maria  depleted all of her savings in order to purchase the store. Looking for a small loan to be able to purchase more materials, Maria decided to join the Seagulls Trust Bank, comprised of seven members who have 29 children among them. Their businesses range from restaurants to veterinary assistance to tortilla-making. Like Maria, they are all striving to make a better life for their families. <p>\r\n\r\nMaria, who has expanded her product line to include purified water, sodas, smoothies and meals, hopes to one day have a larger store to accommodate more customers. \"My group and I feel fortunate that people in other countries, who don't even know us, are willing to support us financially,\" said Maria. \"Our families are benefiting, which is our goal.

","en":"Gulnara is 47 years old, married, and has three children. Seeking sources of income for her family, Gulnara started her own business of animal husbandry from a loan of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's dedicated work, her farm today counts two dairy cows and twelve sheep, which brings in around 15,000 som per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. In order to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional head of livestock. Gulnara is planning on investing the earnings from the loan in further increase of the number of

Falefoe has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Falefoe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Falefoe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 720 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Falefoe is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase more farm supplies & equipment.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by this borrower from SPBD.  Falefoe plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1017251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Having formed in 2010, the ladies are an active and dynamic group; they know each other well; and they share a close friendship. This is their fourth loan cycle, and they paid their three previous loans in full and on time. \n\nAlso in her fourth cycle, Rosa Maria is thirty-six years old, has four children (two boys and two girls) who are in 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th grades.  Rosa Maria is the president of her trust bank, and her business is embroidery, a practice she learned from her husband thirteen years ago. Dedicated to her practice, she is perfecting the technique. Rosa Maria also sells traditional clothing. As she lives near the market, she made a small space in a room in her house to open a small shop where she sells her products. Rosa Maria is excited to get another loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase fabric and thread to fill the orders she has, especially during this time of the year (which is right before Easter).  Many people place orders with her because of her modern designs. Rosa Maria's dream is to have market stall or storefront in the market. Although she has a small space in her house, she wants to be closer to new clients and display her products in the market, that way she would be able to sell more product and generate more income to support her family. \n\nOn behalf of her Trust Bank partners, Rosa Maria, says, \u201cI am very happy that people from other countries who have more possibilities, have the desire to help those who intend to move forward with small businesses. I thank Kiva investors for opening the doors of opportunity for the benefit of our families and community.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1013228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

The group is very active and dynamic; it is composed of seven women, dedicated to various commercial and production activities, such as: sale of clothing, animal husbandry, and the sale of meat, which are sold in the community or the nearest market (20 minutes away from the village).

In recent years Maria Francisca has been a working with livestock, rather than weaving. She sells her products in the market nearby (20 minutes from where she lives) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Maria Francisca believes strongly in good education, although she did not have the opportunity to attend school herself, but she encourages her daughters, currently in kindergarten, 1st, 4th and 5th grades, to stay in school.  Her dream is that they graduate from high school and ultimately from college. \n\nWith the new loan, Maria Francisca wants to increase her sales. She plans to add variety to her business, so she will buy more chickens, turkeys, ducks and pigs to meet her clients\u2019 needs. With her income Maria Francisca can provide better standard of living for her family, as the cost of living has increased and her husband's income is not enough. Maria Francisca is very optimistic about the future; she hopes to be more successful through growing her business with the support of her daughters. \n\nMaria Francisca and her Trust Bank are very grateful that people from around the world know about them and take time to invest in them. They believe that Friendship Bridge and Kiva loans make a difference in their lives. \"Wow, technology has advanced, and there are no barriers to support another human being,\" says Francisca Maria

Also, Seyde works on 2.28 hectares of land, where she grows cereal crops, potatoes and sainfoin.

In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.

","en":"Nazira is 37 years old and has three children. In search of a financing source for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 2002 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazira's persistent work, today her business yields about 12,000 som quarterly from sales of milk and meat products. In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep and goats.

","en":"Nabirakan is 60 years old, a widow and lives with her son's family. In search of a financing source for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 2000 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nabirakan's persistent work, today her business has four dairy cows, ten sheep and two horses, which allows her to earn about 15,000 som per month from sales of milk and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy purebred sheep.

Their meetings are located in the municipality of Monterrey, N.L. \r\n\r\nMaria is one of the members of the 'Jade' group. She is a very hard working woman and is 44 years old. She has two children, a 5 year old boy who is in kindergarten and a teenage girl who is 18 years old and works in a small clothing store. Maria has been a merchant in mobile markets for the past 5 years. She told us that her business began when her sister gave her a large amount of clothing and toys. But because it gave her shame to go out and sell, her daughter was the one who started selling. After some time she got comfortable with the idea and with the help of a loan she increased her sales and started to sell beauty products, jewelry, corn on the cob and 'frituras' (a fried snack food) as well.

She is married and has 4 children, two of which are adults and the other two, whom she is still caring for are 8 years old and 10 years old. They are both in school and in a few weeks will resume with classes again. \r\n\r\nBenedicta and her husband work hard to help their children get ahead. Her husband earns income preparing and distributing meals and she sells groceries and ice creams from her small store. Her store was recently reopened, thanks to one of her older children. A few months ago her husband had an accident and was not able to work to provide income. They got to the point where they only had money for day to day necessities and nothing to reinvest in the store. It is because of this that their son decided to help them by taking out a loan so that Benedicta could stock her store and re-open her business, with the only condition that she must work hard. With this good news Benedicta was filled with joy and she re-opened her store. Thanks to God her husband has now recovered and has returned to work.    \r\n\r\nBenedicta has the dream of opening a Mini Market. She is currently working an average of 15 hours a day. She has her business in the front part of her living room so that she can take care of her small children at the same time. With much effort and dedication she will be able to improve her income, but right now she doesn't have the necessary money to buy the school supplies and other items that she will need when classes start in a few weeks, and which her customers have already started asking for.

","en":"Ainagul is a 49-year-old widow who is raising a son, still in school.  Like many families in search of income for their family, Ainagul fattens livestock.  She started this activity in 2009 with an initial amount of 20,000 som (KGS).  Today, she owns one cow and a couple of sheep, and the sale of dairy and meat products allows her to earn close to 8,000 som per month for her family.  In order to further expand her business, Ainagul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy a dairy cow.  With her revenues, she plans to do some repairs in her

is 41 years old, married, and has two children, the oldest of whom goes to the firsts grade. Guldana is an accountant by trade. In 2008, while searching for help to increase her family's income, she started her own business in trade.   Due to hard work and diligence, Guldana was able to develop her business so that it provides 2,000 KGS every month. Right now, she does not carry a wide assortment of goods. Therefore, she approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to increase her inventory. With income from the loan, Guldana plans to buy a shop in the market that will be comfortable for her customers and increase her sales.

Natalya was born and grew up in Ak-Suu on the family farm. After graduating from high school, she married a fellow villager. Natalya's husband worked as a mechanic on one of the largest cooperative farms, and she worked in a sugar factory. Five years later, Natalya and her husband collected the money to buy a small house in Ak-Suu. For additional income, the family decided to farm. The husband built a place for the livestock. They bought a few piglets. Today, Natalya and her son take care of the household. Her husband works on a tractor, but since his work is seasonal, in the winter, he slaughters livestock and sells the meat at the local market.

She says that her group goes by the name \u201cLos Girasoles\u201d (The Sunflowers) since there are many of those flowers where they have their meetings and for that reason they use that name. \r\n\r\nPaulina\u2019s had a beauty shop for more than eight years, and she says that she has it in her house and that she began that business because, since she was very young, she liked cutting hair, applying dye, and fixing hair for her friends and cousins. It\u2019s for this reason that she decided to study this profession. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to improve her business conditions like buying new furniture. She says that \u201ceven though the furniture I\u2019m getting is a little expensive, little by little I\u2019m going to change it out since what I have is very run down and I want to have a good look for my beauty salon.\u201d \r\n\r\nShe says that she is very happy with the loan that she will get because she will have more clients and improve her business conditions. One of her goals is to work very hard since she want to expand her salon and move to a more central location in order to have more clients. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Graciela, Sofia, Gabriela, Ysabel, Felipa, Mar\u00eda, Sof\u00eda S., Anita, Marlen, Ver\u00f3nica, Juana, Teresa, Itxe, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Juana, Ma Remedios, Raquel, and Mariana.

In 2008, in search of an additional source of revenue for her family, she started her own livestock breeding business, with a starting amount of 30,000 som (KGS).  Through hard work and perseverance, she was able to develop her farming business which now consists of 3 cows, 10 sheep, 2 horses and 15 goats, bringing her about 5,000 som (KGS) from the sale of dairy and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, Nurzhan has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners, requesting a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock.  In the near future, she is planning to use her profits to expand her business by growing potatoes.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1018186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Jar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-29T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-30T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurzhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35556.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339104},{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":35556.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329699}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T20:39:05Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":398344,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora is 40 years old, is married, and has 4 children in school.

For the past 7 years, Francis has been working hard to manage his small business, which sells produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Francis has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce for resale, and will help Francis to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Francis hopes that in the future he will be able to educate his children. \r\n\r\nFrancis is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Okitella hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nOkitella is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Okitella who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1017645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her activity began with breakfasts because in her neighborhood there was a sports league, after which she added lunches. She stopped working for one year due to much travel but she returned a year ago and has since begun selling lunches. She works alongside her husband and begins at 6 am to purchase vegetables and supplies and begins to prepare the meals. Her challenge is transportation to go purchase the vegetables and when it's time to return home. Her husband puts together wooden furniture and helps her a lot in her business. They have three children all of whom are adults. Her dream is to continue working with D-MIRO and increase her business activity from her home.

They live in a small community called the Trinchera de Pital, which is in the Alajuela province.  Their main business activities are livestock and agriculture.  Growing pineapples stands out because they are mainly sold to international markets.  For this reason the community has been developing and growing in the last few years.  This has been generating a greater demand for products and services, which offers greater opportunities for work.  Jenny has devoted herself to agriculture for several years.  She distributes her product to most of the neighbors in her community.  They are very satisfied with the quality.\r\n\r\nJenny Cristina is currently requesting a loan for 500,000 colones to plant yucca and pineapple.  She will also buy fertilizers and agricultural chemicals.  She will do this in order to get good quality harvests, to get ahead with all of the daily expenses, and to give her family a better quality of life.  With this investment she hopes that her small business will grow, and that she will be able to take care of more customers and offer them better products at harvest time.  All of this will help improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\nJenny Cristina is a member of Trinchera de Pital's \"Empresa Comunal de Mujeres al \u00c9xito\" (Community Venture of Successful Women), one of EDESA's 150 member organizations in Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to continue growing on a personal and a financial level.

After graduating from a secondary school, he was accepted to the Kapan construction technical college.  Masis is married and has two daughters and a son.  His children attend the Kapan secondary school, and Masis' wife is a homemaker.  Since 2000, he has been involved in an entrepreneurial business of manufacturing construction blocks and panels.  Masis has all of the necessary equipment, which allows him to make quality construction materials.  He accepts private orders from people and, thanks to the quick and quality execution of orders, never has a shortage of clients.  He buys his raw materials, such as cement and sand, in Kapan.  Masis likes his work very much, and he works without days off.  His son learns this trade after his school studies, so that he could fully help his father with the business after graduating from school.  Masis supports his family thanks to his business.  He has already obtained two loans from the Nor Horizon organization.  This time, Masis decided to buy a large inventory of raw materials at the Yerevan wholesale markets, where prices are much lower.  He needs a loan in the sum of 800,000 dram for this purpose.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1013619,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2550,"youtubeId":"vhABjUqhr_0","title":"Kiva
