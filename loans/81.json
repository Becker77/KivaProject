In school, she only went as far as junior high.  She is a widow and has two children, a boy and a girl; both already married. Currently she lives alone.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena tells us that she has always worked, since she likes to keep busy, especially since her husband died around 8 years ago.  In the afternoons she sold chicharrones (pork rinds) and slices of watermelon to earn a bit of extra money. Eventually, she began to sell a few groceries in the hallway of her home. Gradually, as sales were good, she built a small store in front of her house, where she continued selling groceries. She called her business \"Abarrotes Britani\" (Britani Groceries), and when her husband died, she wasn't left unprotected since she had a business to work in, that could enable her to get ahead in life.  \r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy milk, rice, beans, sugar, soft drinks, salt, cookies, candy, coffee, cheese, cream, soap, bleach, toilet paper, canned goods, tomatoes, chiles, and onions in order to re-stock her business.

She has been married for 2 years, and from this marriage has a son, Kelvin, who she cares for in her own home in the rural Cayan settlement.  The struggle to provide for her family is her main virtue.  From the time she was married, she began to cultivate her lands, scattering potato seeds of every variety and quality.  According to her, every morning she goes out to care for and clear her croplands; she harvests her crops after many months of work.  She now has 3 years of experience in farming, and what she likes the most is to be able to see her crops grow little by little.  What she dislikes is when she has to cut the price of her products in the market.  But, as she is an intelligent woman, she finds other ways to generate income, such as caring for the bulls and cows that she has.  According to her, now one of her cows is pregnant, so very soon she will have enough milk to make the rich cheeses that only she knows how to prepare.

Her husband trained her in the business, since she did not learn any trade from her parents.\r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about Le 1,912,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Adama has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy pans, hot pots, drinking buckets, and dishes. The balance of the loan is for transportation costs.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 478,000. In the future, Adama plans to build a larger outlet to display her goods; she is excited about the future as she wants her children to have a good education and a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nRainy season is a major problem and also changes in foreign exchange rate are a problem. Competition is low as she is the only one dealing in that product. Adama serves people around the city and neighboring villages. She has good quality goods at an affordable price.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is known for being a devoted mother and homemaker. She learned farming work when she was very young since her father taught her this work. Although her job requires sacrifice, she likes it. Perhaps this is why she protects from harm her crops of avocados, bananas, and citrus fruits. Her husband accompanies her every working day. Along with this job, she raises hens and pigs which are then sold in the city market and whose earnings help her with some inexpected problems since she doesn't want to take her savings that are intended for the purchase of productive land where she will renew and alternate new products that grow in the area. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is satisfied to belong to her community group since it is a very unified group with a log of desire to get ahead. With the loan that she is requesting, she will purchase 20 sacks of fertilizer to level the production of her crops.           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":525201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar 20 sacos de fertilizantes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886326}],"funded_date":"2010-04-18T23:43:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":197650,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana P. is from the village of Brgy.

His experience in the trade was acquired when he worked for 9 years in a large footwear company which operated an industrial free-trade zone.  There, in spite of being in an administrative position, he learned all the techniques and stages of the production process.  After leaving the company, he perfected his knowledge by attending a number of shoemaker's courses in the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA (the National Apprenticeship Service).  \n\nCurrently Edgardo produces all kinds of footwear which he sells by the dozen in stores and warehouses across the city.  He makes his sales for cash and occasionally allows 30 to 45 days for his customers to pay.  His average profit margin is 43% and his monthly sales are on average $2,700,000.  His workshop, although it is small, has an industrial sewing machine and all the manual equipment he needs to produce any type of footwear.  Normally Edgardo works alone but in the end-of-year season his orders usually increase considerably and he hires an assistant who helps him cut his synthetic material and leather.\n\nThis is Edgardo's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He is requesting $1,000,000 which he plans to invest in the purchase of leather, synthetic material, rubber, soles and iron fittings.  Edgardo says that one of his biggest achievements has been to sell his products in spite of the strong competition which he has seen from imports of similar products at lower prices but of inferior quality.  He dreams of having a larger shoemaker's workshop, equipped with modern machinery and many employees.  With his small workshop, Edgardo has managed to pay for his children to study in higher education which is his biggest

Together, the couple meet the various household expenses. \r\n\r\nAlmost nine years ago, Sylvie and her family settled in Logbozounkpa, in the community of Abomey Calavi. Her work involves selling cloth, hair extensions, and shoes via the distribution system. This helps her to support herself and her children. She buys her products in Nigeria, a state neighboring Benin.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of bolstering her business and satisfying her customer base, Sylvie, along with the other group members, is requesting a loan from ALID\u00e9. Her ambition is to strengthen her business further, so as to grow her revenues.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":754104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Oretha does not get financial support for her children from their father. She also cares for her mother.\r\n\r\nOretha's business is the sale of foodstuffs such as flour, sugar, butter, beans and rice.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ignacia M. is from the village of Rizalina. She is 63 years old. Ignacia is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nIgnacia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Ignacia owns & operates a business selling food, primarily snacks & other delicacies, that she sells in the local community. Ignacia has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ignacia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ignacia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Ignacia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Ignacia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":525222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

N. is forty years old, married and has three children aged between the ages of nineteen years old and fifteen years old. Her business is located at Murera Juja a very busy market at Thika. She operates a hardware store in which she has been selling pipes, bicycle spare parts and other items. She has been selling to the local people for the last five years.\r\n\r\nShe has provided employment to one person. She says that this business is profitable, and the major challenge she has is insecurity in the area. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well.

Located among majestic baobab trees about 20 miles inland from the beach resort area of Mbour, Louly Ngokom is a poor village that depends on its youth in the cities to send money and rice home in the hungry months of August and September. In the summer of 2004, villagers lacked capital to buy seeds to plant their main cash crop, peanuts. For the initial lending, 15 household heads were chosen by Doudou and a counsel of village elders to receive a loan of $25 each to purchase of seeds before the planting season. After the harvest, 99.5% reimbursed the loans with an interest rate of 6%. In 2005, with continuing donations through John Fay, GENSEN and the village counsel were able\u00a0to increase\u00a0the loan and the number of beneficiaries to 33 persons, 17 men and 16 women selected on a rotating basis. <br \/><br \/>In its goal of becoming a self-sufficient model village, Louly has in its favor a partnership with a new modern ecovillage group, introduced with the facilitation of the GENSEN NGO, SOS Environment. In fact, the ecovillage of Louly Ngokom consists of the existing traditional inhabitants plus this new group of about 20 incoming settlers, who already have started to employ local youth to grow organic bananas and produce and to construct modern ecological dwellings.

graduating from school Shoira A. got married. Her husband used to work seasonally (he helped his uncle to grow grapes). After the birth of their 4th child, Shoira had to begin trading at the market while her oldest daughter took care of the children. Initially, Shoira purchased goods from wholesale traders, but the prices were very high when she had to take out loans. In the summer of 2006, she found out about a credit program called \"Microinvest\". After receiving her first loan, she was able to secure lower prices for the goods she purchased wholesale, which allowed her to gain additional income. One part of the income was spent on family needs and the remaining part Shoira invested in her business. In order to be more competitive in her business, she plans to travel to Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic) to purchase goods. This way, she will expand to a wholesale business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u044e\u0431\u0447\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430

Manzurahon was born in 1964. She is married and has two children. She inherited a sewing machine from her mother which has been a necessity in her life. By remembering her mother's words \"a woman must know how to sew\" she decided to develop her skills in sewing. She started her own business by making national Tajik dresses. To develop her business Manzurahon has reconstructed part of her house to make a sewing shop where she installed six sewing machines. <p>Right now, besides making national clothes, she also does embroidery and printing of colorful designs on fabrics and clothes. She wants to receive a loan for 4,000 somoni (USD$1,200) to buy raw materials: thread, fabrics, cotton fiber and other supplies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":364419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more ornaments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T03:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105846},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022956},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868197},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757393},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146487}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T11:04:56Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":131288,"name":"Betzabeth","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Betzabeth es una joven madre de 24 a\u00f1os, vive al lado de su esposo y sus 3 hijos en una casa arrendada.

She owns a business venture,  selling smokes to the local community.  Faatafunaina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faatafunaina needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faatafunaina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faatafunaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatafunaina F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business. She will be buying more quantities of products to be incorporated into her current stock inventory. She also will invest some of the loan to maintain their pigs.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives in the house she inherited from her parents. She lives with her 2 children and her grandson Piero who is 6 years old. \r\n\r\nFor many years she took orders for items of clothing for her clients. Ten months ago she managed to set up a stand in the interior of the most visited market in the region. Since them she gets up early in the morning to prepare the day's food for the kids and then she makes her way to her stand. She is fascinated by her business. She generally works alone but when she goes out to make her purchases she requests assistance from her sister-in-law, so that she does not miss out on any sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to make her business grow by selling locally made items of clothing as well as imported goods, to have the clients' interest. This is the first loan she requests from MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to the obligations of the loan. She hopes to earn the right to have future loans, to supplement her working capital. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she requests she will purchase more casual style clothing, to meet the demand of her clients. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":590398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase casual style clothing to meet client demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.2},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":348.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":371.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":397.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":417.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":426.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.69},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":113.35,"local_amount":316.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":317.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154542},{"amount":122.26,"local_amount":341.2,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":342.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449854},{"amount":124.88,"local_amount":348.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":349.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588547},{"amount":133.12,"local_amount":371.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":372.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725059},{"amount":136.69,"local_amount":381.45,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":382.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463158},{"amount":142.34,"local_amount":397.23,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":398.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886565},{"amount":150.07,"local_amount":418.8,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":420.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326901},{"amount":152.29,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":426.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195502}],"funded_date":"2010-09-16T18:03:09Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":230457,"name":"Rwenyerere Bakyara Tukwatanise Group, Kihihi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As they say, hard work pays!

They are sold for cash to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make an average monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA. This profit will enable him to repay his loan and invest the rest in his business.  He plans to become a reputable wholesaler in order to satisfy his many customers who continue to grow more numerous.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":735511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-03-21T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bamory ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226594},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301435},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581012},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750804},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120111},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84829.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881979}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T21:21:39Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":287830,"name":"Jose Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene dos hijos menores.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.

neighborhoods of Dakar. We intend to set up sales points in the various neighborhoods where people raise sheep, goats, and chickens. In general, it is very productive to set up such a project since breeders have to find feed daily for their livestock or their poultry. This project will allow us to create work for all the members of the group, since each of us will be responsible for managing one of the sales points in our eco-village. Thus, thanks to Kiva, we will be able to create jobs for young people who will then no longer have to consider taking off by sea to immigrate illegally, incurring who knows what consequences. <P> <B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Notre projet consiste \u00e0 l'achat et au stockage d'aliments pour animaux d'\u00e9levage et ensuite les revendre aux \r\n\r\n\u00e9l\u00e8veurs qui sont dans les villes et les diff\u00e9rents quartiers de Dakar. Nous allons constituer des points de \r\n\r\nvente dans les diff\u00e9rents quartiers de la ville o\u00f9 les populations s'adonnent \u00e0 l'\u00e9levage de moutons, ch\u00e8vres \r\n\r\net poulets. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant de monter un projet pareil car tous les jours, les populations \r\n\r\nvont \u00e0 la recherche d'aliment pour leur b\u00e9tails ou pour leur poulailler domestique.

She is married and has a child. Oteka\u2019s business is sewing traditional women\u2019s dresses. Three years ago, she started offering her services as a seamstress to her neighbors and acquaintances. She conducts this work with only one sewing machine right now. She sells finished clothes in the market. <P>\r\n\r\nFortunately, the good service that she offers and the good materials with which she works help her to make her small factory progress. Despite her young age, Oteka already has apprentices at her tailoring shop. As a result of the large quantity of orders, she needs to acquire another machine so she may satisfy the orders. For that reason in mind, she is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni for a term of 10 months to buy a sewing machine. With your help, Oteka can grow her business and improve her family\u2019s quality of life. She thanks you for your trust and support.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She will buy kitchen utensils, food, and drinks with the loan money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":374600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of food and utencils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-21T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":141.78,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641734},{"amount":141.78,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081205},{"amount":141.78,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997356},{"amount":141.78,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":419.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842700},{"amount":282.88,"local_amount":832,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":837.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734282}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T01:38:47Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":135420,"name":"Chheun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chheun N. is 29 years old and a resident of Kampong Chhnang Province.

She lives in a rented house with her husband Hugo, 36, and their 3 children: Rodolfo, 16; Yadira, 15; and Frank, 10. Her husband and children are the reason for all of her hard work.\r\n\r\nNancy\u2019s business is located in the Laguna Temporal esplanade (a place where markets are set up in the city of Juliaca).  Her artisanal weaving booth is one of the most visited, since the designs she has are very original.  She weaves the artisanal garments herself, and so she gives her weavings the finish that she wants.  The thing Nancy likes most about her work is weaving, and as long as she weaves she feels better; besides, it allows her to pay for her younger children\u2019s studies.  She has made a living in this business for 2 years, and says that the thing she finds most difficult is transporting her crafts to her booth, since she lives very far from there.  In the future she hopes to set up a store where she can sell her garments more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis is Nancy\u2019s sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP.  She is very punctual in making her payments, since she does not want to cause problems at her communal bank; she is very happy with her bank and knows that it will help her to make progress.  Nancy is asking for 1600 soles and will use the money to purchase more wool so that she can increase the amount of garments she produces.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":479626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T08:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":265}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":267,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":276.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960300},{"amount":95.96,"local_amount":267,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":276.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993144},{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":267,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":276.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717930},{"amount":95.95,"local_amount":267,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":276.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751604},{"amount":95.96,"local_amount":267,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":276.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934072},{"amount":95.23,"local_amount":265,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":274.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672849}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T09:54:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":176842,"name":"Orubu 1 Apiyo Rosemary Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Her marriage life was never a success because her husband left her with their two children. However, this trial never became a burden to her; instead, she made it an opportunity to work hard and show that she could raise their children alone. \n\nThe year 2009 is when she heard of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.(ASHI) \u2013 a microfinance institution and partner of Kiva in the Philippines looking for poor women who would like to join the program. Along with four of her friends, she joined ASHI full of hopes and dreams. After a year of good performance and dedication, she slowly gained what she came for. From her loans, she was able to begin a business of buying and selling food, and from her profits, send her children to school. Her eldest son finished a course in a vocational school and is now a technician, while the youngest is still in high school. \n\nShe applies for another loan of 15,000.00 pesos to increase the capital for her buying and selling business. She wants to buy more fruits, vegetables and fish to sell in her community and in the market. Her dreams are for her business to become stable, to buy a motorcycle that they can use to transport their goods, that her youngest will finish a course in college and, most especially, to renovate their house for more comfortable living. She is praying that more friends from ASHI and Kiva will support her and her family.

Margie has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Margie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Margie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Margie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Margie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Masaling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental, in the Philippines. She earns a living through 3 business ventures: operating a general store, buying and selling rice, and fattening pigs.\r\n\r\nAmalia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of 12 prior loans from Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living.  This time, for her thirteenth loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy inventory for the general store and feed for the pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business ventures.\r\n\r\nAmalia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF's alleviation program empowers women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. The women are taking a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\"--a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a fruits & vegetables business.  Her husband Petronito, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have two children who are 12 and 23 years old.  Merylou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merylou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy additional bananas for resale so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.  Merylou is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He is married to a trader, and has five children aged 15, 10, 8, 6 and 3 years, three are school going children. In 2001, Alie established his pot making business. He began his business because he went into blacksmith work when he lost his father at the age of 16 years and there was nobody to support his education.  His mother was a housewife and since there was no money to support his schooling, she sent him to a blacksmith workshop to be trained in making pots.  Now he is a specialist in making pots.  Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 2,140,875 every month from this business.  \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.  Alie has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to produce the following - 8 big sets of pots, 5 medium sets of pots, and 7 small sets of pots. The balance Le 30,000 will be used to transport the raw materials.  \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 2,140,88. In the future, Alie plans to acquire his own workshop and educate his children to the university level which he was able to do himself.  His major problem is that sometimes he can make a pot and missed the dimensions that will lead to him having to redo it to get the correct quality. He serves about 15 customers each day, his business is popular because he is the only pot maker around that locality.  He has three trainees in his workshop.  He gets his raw materials from Freetown and Makeni Township.  He usually transports his materials by public transport. He plows back the profit into the business. \r\n\r\nHe thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":926489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to produce new pots at his blacksmith shop and transport the raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T18:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721828},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124737},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505643},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974749},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815317},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444374},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537106},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284597},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338188},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":404625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354599}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T00:51:19Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":365738,"name":"Chhit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chhit is a married woman who has been residing in the Reussey Keo commune, Phnom Penh.

Rosemary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":275100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more shirts; hand bags and pouches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130799},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027588},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613589},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010668},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105199.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232954}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T14:11:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":94437,"name":"Mrs. Roeng Chea Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sixteen people living in Prasat village in Kandal province are asking for a village bank loan to use for various purposes.

Sin embargo, considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que trasladar su mercader\u00eda desde el centro de la ciudad hasta el lugar donde vende, siendo muy pesada esta labor. Para el futuro, Luisa ans\u00eda comprar un puesto adicional para vender productos para el hogar y de esa manera incrementar sus ingresos y poder solventar los estudios de sus hijas.\nEste es su catorceavo cr\u00e9dito con Microfinanzas PRISMA, donde la puntualidad la ha diferenciado, ya que es considerada como una persona muy cumplida con sus pagos, es as\u00ed que se gan\u00f3 el respeto y cari\u00f1o de todas sus compa\u00f1eras de grupo. Luisa necesita la cantidad de tres mil soles para comprar mercader\u00eda en las f\u00e1bricas de ropa, ya que la nueva temporada se avecina y pretende tener lo necesario para cubrir las expectativas de sus clientes.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":394167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-25T02:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":452.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":491.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":508.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":531.82},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":556.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.21,"local_amount":452.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":455.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997586},{"amount":161,"local_amount":460,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":463.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842935},{"amount":491.3,"local_amount":1403.71,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734510},{"amount":44.79,"local_amount":127.97,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":129.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959639},{"amount":194.7,"local_amount":556.29,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":560.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992453}],"funded_date":"2009-10-19T04:31:54Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":143669,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is a very industrious business woman who is engaged in managing a village store.

I. is 38 and married with 6 children (ages 10 - 20).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faleala has many years of experience in this business.  Faleala needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Faleala joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faleala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 24 years old, single, and lives in the city of Chinchero in the department of Cusco. He is studying to become a tour guide at the Instituto Superior Americana del Cusco, and he works making and selling woven goods such as shawls, belts, and chullos [typical Andean wool caps]. He makes these at a craft studio called \u201cNiway Away\u201d and sells them to tourists who visit the city. \r\n\r\nAdolfo is investing 500 dollars in the materials he uses, such as alpaca wool and looms. He's been doing this work for two years, and working with the Kiva field partner has allowed him to get ahead and helped his business grow. With the new loan he will expand to sell more items and will buy more materials to work with. It is his hope to one day have his own studio in which to make his crafts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":550357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials such as alpaca wool and looms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.37,"local_amount":77.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":77.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851944},{"amount":79.71,"local_amount":79.71,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159590234},{"amount":82.09,"local_amount":82.09,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800957},{"amount":84.55,"local_amount":84.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070730},{"amount":87.1,"local_amount":87.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":87.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362056},{"amount":89.18,"local_amount":89.18,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":89.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497037}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T04:18:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:05:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Remedios is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives in a brick house, in the outer ger housing districts of the city. Odongerel\u2019s two sons live apart from her, but she still supports them. Odongerel believes that if her sons live on their own, they will gain valuable life skills. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Odongerel began purchasing Mongolian dairy food products from local herders and reselling them to customers. In 2008, she sold her dairy food equipment in order to purchase a metal container at Narantuul market. In 2009, she began working together with her oldest son to operate a clothing accessories retail business from an outdoor stall and the metal container she owns at Narantuul. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she doesn't own the outdoor stall's rental contract. She's renting from a middleman and not directly from the Narantuul market. It's her goal to have 2 million MNT of working capital in order to purchase the rental contract from the current owner.

To make a living, Eden owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Eden has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eden joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Eden is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Eden from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Sergia works diligently on her land so that it will yield productive returns.  She grows cacao, coffee, and turmeric.  These products are in great demand.  She takes her harvest to the collection centers located in the city of San Francisco, where she is able to generate considerable earnings.  Her crops provide her with the necessary income to support her family and pay for her child\u2019s educational expenses.  For this reason, Sergia does all she can to make her land productive.  What she enjoys most about her work is protecting her crops against plagues of insects, and she is willing to do whatever it takes.  Sergia has been farming for eight years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products from the field to her community.  This journey requires one hour of walking, but she knows that she will be rewarded for all of her efforts.  Now her greatest priority is to buy animal manure for fertilizing her crops, which will ensure a good harvest.  For this reason, she asks for all the help she can get so that she can follow through with her plans.  In the future, she hopes to buy more land so that she can increase production.\r\n\r\nThis will be her ninth loan with MFP.  Sergia says that she repaid her previous loans on time and hopes to do the same now.  She is an active participant in her Communal Bank.

She makes sure that she gives the best to her six children so that they can be productive in the future and support themselves. Esther enjoys farming, especially milking and grazing her dairy cows. Esther has farmed for eight years, and is recognized as one of the best farmers in her village. Because of this, most villagers want products from her farm. This has increased her profits. \r\n\r\nAlthough she enjoys selling her products to the nearby market and to neighbors, her income is not sufficient to enable her to comfortably take care of her family. Therefore, she plans to start a poultry farm. Esther requests 30,000 KES to start a poultry farm to improve her income.
