Seeking a source of income for her family back in 1995, she started her business of animal husbandry with an amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Manat's dedicated work and persistence, she managed to expand her business. As of today, the farm counts 9 cows, 25 sheep and 1 horse, and brings in around 5,000 som (KGS) from the sale of dairy and meat products. In order to further develop her business, Manat turned to the organization Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase bull calves. In the near future, Manat is planning on investing the earnings from the loan in reconstruction of the cattle yard."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1018200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married and has three children - a son and two daughters.  His youngest daughter and son attend a village secondary school, and the oldest daughter graduated from school two years ago and currently does not study anywhere and does not work.  Feliks' wife is a homemaker and also helps him with running the agricultural business.  Feliks works as a forest ranger in the Syunik forestry and, parallel to this, is involved in an agricultural business in his village.  Together with his wife, Feliks breeds cattle, chickens, pigs and also grows fruits and vegetables.  He has a small plot of land, which serves as the pasture for cattle, and, thanks to which, he does not have to buy livestock feed for them.  Feliks sells his agricultural products, such as vegetables, fruits, beef, pork, milk and eggs, to his regular customers in the city of Kapan.  Thanks to his agricultural business, Feliks is able to support his family.  He currently needs a loan in the sum of 300,000 dram to purchase combined feed for pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1018277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She raises two children. Aizaada works as an office clerk in the local Administration. Seeking an additional source of income for her family 10 years ago, she started her business of animal husbandry with an amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aizaada's dedicated work and persistence, she managed to expand her business. As of today, her farm counts 2 cows and 10 sheep, and brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. In order to further develop her business, Aizaada turned to the organization Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep. In the near future, Aizaada is planning on investing the earnings from the loan in further increase of the number of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1018203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Currently, Cecilia does not have the money she needs to be able to buy rice, sugar, noodles, milk and any school supplies, that she wants to sell because of the quantity of people requesting them at the beginning of the school term, at wholesale \r\n\r\nCecilia has lots of orders and she knows that with this opportunity she will be able to sell what her customers need and improve her income. Her goal is that in a few months she will have established herself as a shopkeeper in her area and be able to offer her customers a better welcome, as well as to make herself a great small business woman. Her other dream is to be a great mother and provide the best possible example to her daughters.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1016846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She previously worked as a nurse at a local clinic. However, the salary at a clinic was so low that Rahbaroy decided to quit and started her business instead. One year ago, she started selling food and household goods in her own stall. Rahbaroy's husband is an apartment repair man. He hung shelves in the stall to display the items and helped Rahbaroy settle down. Rahbaroy is glad that the loans helped her increase the turnover.

She wants to have her house and a stable business, to save and live a tranquil and safe life.\n\nRosa is very excited to receive her four loan through Esperanza International. She took her first loan around two years ago, and after receiving these loans she has been able to make investments in her small business.\n\nRosa has a Colmado, this is a small food market, where neighbors go to buy their daily meal, She will invest this loan to buy rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, flour, and other goods. Rosa dreams of having a safe house and a successful business. \n\nThis group is composed of five Haitian immigrants located in the city of La Romana, where tourists and sugarcane are the biggest industries. They all live in a rural area called Batey, surrounded by sugarcane fields.

In May of 2010, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Nataliya decided to get involved in providing food services and invested an initial sum of 80,000 som (KGS).  Putting all of her efforts into developing this business, she achieved success, and her monthly profit now amounts to about 25,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from this business allowed her to lease a more comfortable building for her cafe.  In order to continue developing her business, Nataliya requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase her working capital in order to expand the selection of the cafe menu offerings and to purchase chairs and tables.  This would allow her to increase the number of customers and provide employment for local students.  Nataliya plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her cafe and dreams of creating a chain of cafes in Jalal-Abad in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1018370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She stocks up with fruit in the wholesale food market in a nearby town.

She says that she will also use part of her loan to buy organic fertilizers and insecticides as she has 60 avocado trees and she would like to keep them in good health because the harsh frosts that have hit her community affected her, burning her trees.  She would like to feed them so that she doesn't lose them completely.

Their neighbourhood is called El Moral, and to identify themselves easily, all the mmbers decided to call the group El Moralito. Beatriz is very happy to have such a hardworking group: there have been no problems with repayments, and they all help each other. She is a woman who works hard to improve her living conditions. From a very young age she began helping at her father's stall selling chips and pancakes, where she learned well. She now has over 15 years experience in her own business, selling churros, chips, French fries, pancakes, drinks, roast potatoes and gravy and much more, at fairs and festivals. She wants a loan to buy potatoes, caramel, strawberry jam, guava jam, condensed milk, ingredients to make pancakes, cooking oil, different types of sauces, and packs of strawberries to sell strawberries and cream. She buys all the products in local stores, where they give her the best prices. One of her goals is to expand her business and buy a used truck to transport her goods more quickly. \r\n\r\nThe other nine members of the group are called Gloria, Juana Guadalupe, Rosa Isela Maria Felicitas, Olivia, Ana Laura, Ana Lilia, Pablo, and Javier.

There are 52 different communities in the canton. The surrounding area holds an important natural resource, the \"Mindo Nambillo\" Protective Forest. A large area of the canton is covered by grasslands, and the principal economic activity there is cattle-raising. People in the canton also farm palm heart, sugarcane, bananas, and naranjillas over smaller areas. \r\n\r\nPablo has a workshop where he has made crafts for fifteen years. He and several other young people learned to carve a long time ago, and today it is how he earns his living. He works up to twelve hours a day when there are orders to fill. His wife also helps him. \r\n\r\nThe problem at the moment is finding an assistant who knows how to do this work as it is quite difficult to do.

Yola, as her friends call her lovingly, is 52 and part of the group called \u201cLas Nenas\u201d (the Girls) She says that her companions chose this name because in this group all the women are thought to be pretty and lively and cheerful. She has had a grocery store for 7 years and she set it up to have a little more income to help her husband.\r\nNow she tells us she is having problems because 8 months ago she started to lose her sight because of her diabetes and so she will have surgery in a few days.   She says that she is a little nervous but she prays to God that her operation will come out well since she needs to have the cataracts removed. She tells us that she badly needs the loan so that her store will be well supplied.   This is because there will be days when she can\u2019t leave after the surgery and will then spend all her time in the store instead of going out to sell typical snack foods on weekend evenings.   She will use the loan to buy milk, eggs, sugar, beans, cans of tuna and sardines, oil, soap, etc.  One of her dreams is to expand her business and to have a little of many products so that the people in her neighborhood don\u2019t have to travel to other areas to buy their staple items.  She is married to Jos\u00e9 Antonio and he helps her a lot with her business.  They have an 18-year old son who is in high school.\r\n\r\nThe other eleven members of the group are: Rosalba, Alma Yanet, Lizbeth, Mar\u00eda Minerva, Gloria, Alicia, Mar\u00eda del Socorro, Celia, Claudia Minerva, Alma Delia and  Mar\u00eda  Beatriz.   They will use their loans to buy bedspreads, purses, typical snacks, sweets, fried foods, juices, shoes through catalogs and supplies of beauty products and perfumes, ingredients to make popsicles, oysters, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1010970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy items such as milk, eggs, sugar, beans, cans of tuna and sardines, oil, soap, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

The most difficult thing to combat is not being able to fight the pests and weeds that affect her crops, but yet she continues with her work since it is the way to deal with household expenses. Martina and her husband are concerned about their children\u2019s education and early every morning they head to their plot of land so that during the harvest times they will obtain good production.  Ever since the neighbors talked to Martina about the MFP loans, she has not hesitated to take part in them in order to carry on with her work plans. This will be her first credit with MFP, and she has agreed to pay her loan repayments on time so that later she can receive another opportunity to access another credit. She is a responsible member of her community bank. With the $1,000 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency), she will buy fertilizer in order to maintain her coffee production. \r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1011171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T01:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T01:00:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.13,"local_amount":173.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":174.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099780},{"amount":33.98,"local_amount":90.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":91.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713911},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":94.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202807},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":97.38,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":97.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098476},{"amount":38.1,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":102.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401292},{"amount":39.04,"local_amount":104.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":104.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455603},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":108.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":109.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451375},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":112.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":113.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446555},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":116.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":116.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052591}],"funded_date":"2012-03-01T03:00:31Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":395587,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia, de 42 a\u00f1os, vive en su propia casa junto a 05 queridos hijos y su esposo Arturo de 46 a\u00f1os, quien le apoya en los peores momentos.

In addition to this Rosa still maintains a part-time position with the Department of Education as a Human Resources Employee.  \n\nCurrently Rosa is the only person employed by RSJ, however before the end of the year she hopes to employ a bookkeeper and a tax preparer.

","en":"Tukhtajon is 52 years old, married and is a mother of five children.  She is a successful, punctual and hardworking woman.  She has been a client of our organization since 2002 and has a good credit history.  Tukhtajon started with selling food products.  Despite the fact that she is an older woman, she traveled to wholesale markets no less than once per week to purchase inventories of food products.  Many people at the food market, where she worked, came to her for advice of how to set up sales in order to make a good profit.  Tukhtajon helped everyone without hesitation, and many people are grateful to her today.  Thanks to the earnings from her business, Tukhtajon put all of her children on their feet.  Three years ago, she decided to change her business focus and get involved in sales of children's clothing.  Tukhtajon is successful in this business.  It is now the beginning of spring, and Tukhtajon wants to obtain a spring selection of children's clothing and, thus, increase goods turnover.

and has four children.

The group is comprised of seven women and one man, and they are very hard workers.  Each member of this group is married and has a family.  Each one of them strives day to day to get ahead.  They devote themselves to raising animals like pigs, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.  They do this in order to get income and to help when they can with the expenses, be it for their children in school or for the store in the house.  \r\n\r\nAlso, because they do not work, which is to say that they do not have fixed employment that gives them a salary, they wish to invest part of their time in something that will be productive so they can support their life partners.  They want to do this so that, together, they can get ahead with all of their current necessities. It is worth mentioning that the people in this group are very responsible and hard working.  They like working in order to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nThe San Pedro community is one of the most advanced communities in the municipality.  It has all of the public services like water and drainage, a hospital, schools, and a gas station.  It is also a densely populated community with a lot of vegetation.  Additionally, the community has a lot of professionals and a lot of children attending school.  The group decided upon the name of \u201cAltamirano\u201d because it is the name of an important writer.\r\n\r\nThe names of the eight members are:\r\n\r\n1.-David S., age 42, is requesting his loan to buy 4 sheep and grass to feed them. \r\n2.-Victoria R., age 26, is requesting the loan to buy 2 sheep, 2 pigs, and feed to raise them. \r\n3.-Patricia C., age 34, is requesting her loan to buy 4 pigs, 30 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n4.-Ambrosia G., age 62, is requesting her loan to buy 2 pigs, 10 turkeys, 20 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n5.-Anita R., age 23, is requesting the loan to buy 5 pigs and food to raise them. \r\n6.-Crescencia G., age 45, is asking for the loan to buy 10 pigs, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n7.-Teresa B., age 32, requested the loan to buy 5 sheep and grass to raise them. \r\n8.-Elvira S., age 43, is requesting the loan to buy 2 pigs, 2 sheep, grass, and corn to raise them. \r\n\r\nCrescencia, age 45, is the representative of the group.  She has been married for 27 years to Crisanto, who works as a bricklayer.  They have three children.  The oldest is 29 and married.  The next one is 20 and also married.  The youngest is 17 and is in the last year of high school.  \r\n\r\nCrescencia and her husband live in their own house, which is to say that they do not pay rent.  The reason that Crescencia decided to join this group is because of the desire to undertake a business.  \u201cI am a person who likes to buy and sell my animals.  This is because I realize that at times my husband does not have work, and I help him.  I am one of those people who devote themselves to many things in order to help with my expenses and to help my family.  I do not like to stop working.  I like taking care of the animals constantly so that I am not left without anything to get ahead,\u201d says Crescencia. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy business activity consists of, once I receive my loan, going to the farms where they sell \u201clechones\u201d (this is what the pigs are called when they are still very little).  I do not have to go very far because there is a farm in my community.  I buy the pigs that I am going to raise, and I take them to my house where I have my pen.  I feed them, and I inject them so they will grow.  When they grow I buy feed to fatten them, and then I sell them.  The people in my community know me, they know that I raise pigs, and they come to me,\u201d Crescencia says proudly.\r\n\r\nCrescencia says that so far, thanks to God, she has not had any difficulty carrying out her business activity.  She has not had illnesses, and things in general have gone well for her.\r\n\r\nCrescencia\u2019s goals are very clear.  She would like to make repairs to her house with the received income.  Above all, she wants her children to lack for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe loan that the instituci\u00f3n grants her will be a big help to her in reaching her goals and to continue making progress.\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1013069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs, sheep, and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crescencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":59000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14770.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044490},{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":14770.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656681},{"amount":1715.63,"local_amount":22125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22156.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317353},{"amount":571.87,"local_amount":7375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418743}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T22:16:51Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:17:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":398176,"name":"Nilders Yoel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilders es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su pareja en la ciudad de Ica, El departamento de Ica es el \u00fanico de la costa sur formado por planicies, tambi\u00e9n llamadas llanuras coste\u00f1as, puesto que la Cordillera de los Andes se levanta muy al interior.

The residents of the town where she lives normally work in agriculture and selling cattle.\r\n\r\nLuz is a young mother of a family who has many dreams of reaching new heights, which is why she has begun her business of selling \"chicha de jora\" (a native drink of the Incas).  She begins very early in the morning preparing her supplies with which she will obtain the \"chicha\" in order to be sold to her neighbors and people that work in the country.  Her business has been in opperation for approximately two years already.  The support that she offers her husband is an important addition since it will allow her to reach her goals.\r\n\r\nShe wants to continue growing in her business, and to be able to assist her customers she needs accessories like a stove, pots, chairs, and tables with which she can offer better assistance.  This is why she is asking for a loan from Edpyme Alternative for the amount of 1008 Nuevos Soles.  With the loan, she will invest in the purchase of her accessories.\r\n\r\nShe has already had other loans in the past with our institution, demonstrating her high level of responsibility regarding her payments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1017665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy accessories (tables, chairs, stove)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Morrop\u00f3n -

He lives with Dora, who is 43 years old, with whom he has six children. Three of them are already adults and are independent, while the other three are minors, and for that reason he wants to work hard to offer a better quality of life to his family. Di\u00f3genes' work consists of the purchase and sale of vehicles, including used motorcycles and mototaxis (motorcycles that area converted into taxis), thus he is willing to wait for a buyer and offer him a fair price. As soon as he buys his vehicles, he restores them and leaves them in good condition to sell to his customers. His shop is located in his home, and he has had this business for more than five years. He likes what he does a lot since it allows him to have a good income, apart from giving him sufficient time for other activities. He works alone and has plans for many things, but for now his only desire is to continue working until he has saved enough capital to set up a repair shop and sell new vehicles. This will be his first loan with MFP. He is very happy to know that he will have economic backing through the loan that they are offering him, since he will thus be able to make definite some plans that he has for his business. Furthermore, he promises to be a reliable member and to make his payments punctually, since he wants to enter fully and quickly into the spirit of his communal bank, for which he has good references that they are very united and punctual.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 PEN that he has applied for, he will buy parts to repair some mototaxis that he has and that are waiting to be sold.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":989404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy parts to repair mototaxis","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T08:00:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diogenes ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":151.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":176.6,"local_amount":470.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":475.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099417},{"amount":64.32,"local_amount":171.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":173.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713563},{"amount":65.44,"local_amount":174.51,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":176.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202451},{"amount":68.64,"local_amount":183.04,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":184.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098134}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T13:01:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":384912,"name":"Dushigikirane Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeanine fait partie du groupe Dushigikirane, elle habite \u00e0 Gitega, Elle est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 25 ans et est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Assoumani.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

The father who was supportive to him died because of a tetanus infection, which causes him more frustration.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, Nche George will add his personal contribution and buy a motorbike, which will be used for commercial transportation.  He strongly believes his business will succeed because he is a competent rider, there is longevity in the transportation business, and there is need for the transportation business in his community. With this business, the community will benefit from the transport of farm produce from the farm to the market,  It will facilitate movement in the community, transportat people to their job sites, and it will help to transport student to far distant schools.  \r\n\r\nMany things have happen in his life which he hates thinking about, including the sudden death of his father.  Nche George says the profit from the loan will be used to educate his children, buy parts for the motorbike that are broken or missing, and saved to undertake bigger investments.

He is 56 years of age with five grown-up children. According to him, four of his children are studying while the other one is an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker).\r\n\r\nOmar did not finish his education due to the early death of his father. Another reason is that his family has a large household. Though he didn't continue his studies,  he is able to stand independently from his family. He got married in 1980 and started to raise hogs. By that time, Omar was encouraged to raise a corn crop and engage in the transportation business. With his dedication to improve their living conditions, he endures all the struggles in running his business. Nowadays, he is raising two sows and fattening seven. With the number of hogs he is raising, his budget is not sufficient because of the expensive price of the feed and vaccine for the hogs.The income generated from his farming and vulcanizing shop business was used for his children's education. So,Omar is in need of additional capital amounting to PHP 20,000, which will be used to buy stock feed for his livestock business.Through his additional capital,and continuous financial support by the lenders, he will be able to sustain their daily needs and make his business grow. In this way, Omar would save some for security purposes when he and his wife got weak.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":997748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy feed for his livestock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

Previously, Flavio was a public service worker, however, he was left unemployed when a re-structuring meant that his job became obsolete. Since then, Flavio used his redundancy pay to set up a stationery shop so that he could continue to earn an income for his family.

All the members belong to the commune of Independencia, in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica is part of this communal bank. She is on the second row of the photo, standing up in first position on the right hand side. She is wearing sunglasses, a short-sleeved black T-shirt and her hair is light brown and tied back. She has been making a living sewing clothes for the last two years. She calls her work \"bordado con sentimiento\" [embroidered with feeling], as she writes poems, names or dedications on different articles of clothing, depending on the desires of each customer. Some of her products are blankets and T-shirts. Also, she has introduced making logos for some businesses as a stable source of work. She comments that during the months of January and February she worked for a manufacturer in making blankets.\r\n\r\nHer work has been an important economical support for her family. She buys her materials in the communes of Independencia and Estaci\u00f3n Central.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy T-shirts, blankets, threads, blended paper and towels to embroider. Also, she will pay the maintenance of the sewing machine she uses.\r\n\r\nOne of her short term goals is to buy a computerized sewing machine, to extend her business, as at the moment she uses her mother's machines. In this way, she will also be able to become independent.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica lives with her two children aged 18 and 13. Her oldest daughter will start studying a pre-university course to prepare herself well and take the PSU (prueba de selecci\u00f3n unversitaria [university selection test]) in order to study a dentistry degree at university.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica's motivations are to make an effort every day, to generate a higher income and in this way fulfil her dreams.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the loan provided by Fondo Esperanza, as it has allowed her to invest in her business and to succeed economically. She comments that the communal bank group she participates in is very close and and feels very comfortable.\r\n\r\nIndependencia is one of the 34 communes that make up the city of Santiago (the capital city of Chile), located in the central-north sector. It arose at the end of the 19th century as a traditional part of the city. Its main axis is Independencia Avenue which used to be the ancient Road of the Inca which was the northern gate of the city of Santiago. Because of its extensive indigenous population the Chilean Indigenous Cultural Center is found in Independencia.

Lucila is married and the mother of 2 daughters, one of whom has Down\u2019s syndrome and requires her mother\u2019s attention all the time.  Because her husband\u2019s work doesn\u2019t generate sufficient income to support the household, Lucila decided to start a business some time ago selling personal products by catalog.  Thanks to this activity, she is able to make up for the expenses that are not covered for the home.  Lucila cannot tend to her customers for more time than she currently offers them because she must take care of her daughters.  For this reason, she has not been able to grow her business, despite the fact that she has a good amount of orders.  Regardless, Lucila has some customers that do not require a lot of time and attention, and these placed good orders with her in large quantities.  Thanks to this, the business can continue to function.  With the intention to make delivery of a large order that a client has placed, Lucila needs to buy the requested products from her suppliers.
