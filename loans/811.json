He learned how to farm from his father at a very young age and worked together with his father growing vegetables.  Alberto's parents have now passed away and, as an inheritance, they left him the land which they used to grow crops on.  As a result, Alberto's harvests are now his source of income.  Alberto grows vegetables, especially beans, and has big customers who buy his products from him at a very good price.  Alberto would like to increase the variety of crops that he grows and would like to buy seeds and fertilizers so that he can start growing new vegetables.  Right now, he does not have enough capital to make these purchases and so he hopes to receive a loan which will enable him to buy seeds and fertilizers to grow his new vegetables.\r\n\r\nAlberto hopes that his income will increase significantly as he will be able to offer his customers more products.

persona casada y madre de 3 hijos a los que siempre les ha querido brindar todo lo necesario. Maria Zoraida aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la fabricaci\u00f3n de arepas desde hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os, pues trabaj\u00f3 para una f\u00e1brica de arepas de su municipio. Hace por lo menos 5 meses decidi\u00f3 independizarse y mont\u00f3 su propia f\u00e1brica de arepas, que ha ido construyendo poco a poco a medida que el capital disponible se lo permite. Maria Zoraida actualmente vende sus arepas a algunas tiendas y familias de su municipio, y gracias a esto genera ingresos para el sostenimiento de su hogar junto con su esposo. La manera en que Maria Zoraida fabrica sus arepas es todav\u00eda muy artesanal, pues no cuenta ni con la maquinaria ni con las herramientas adecuadas para fabricar industrialmente sus arepas. Esto hace que no pueda producir en grandes cantidades y a\u00fan tenga que vender pocas cantidades de su producto. Gracias a que sus arepas son muy apetecidas por sus clientes, quienes le han hecho grandes pedidos que no ha podido satisfacer por la poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n que tiene, Maria Zoraida ha tenido la motivaci\u00f3n de comprar algunas m\u00e1quinas y herramientas industriales para la producci\u00f3n de sus arepas adem\u00e1s de la adecuaci\u00f3n de su sitio de trabajo. Es por esto que Maria Zoraida aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de maquinaria para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sus arepas, adem\u00e1s de la adecuaci\u00f3n de su sitio de trabajo, para poder as\u00ed producir su producto en grandes cantidades y poder responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.\n\nMaria Zoraida espera que su negocio crezca y pueda generar empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas, adem\u00e1s de que su familia pueda gozar de los beneficios econ\u00f3micos que le puede traer este. Maria Zoraida sue\u00f1a con que sus 3 hijos puedan tener una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y en un futuro tener una vida econ\u00f3mica estable.\n","en":"'Hardworker' is the best word to describe Maria Zoraida. She is married and the mother of 3 children, to whom she has always wanted to give what they need. Maria Zoraida has been learning this activity of making arepas since she was 5 years old, because she worked for an arepas factory in her town. At least 5 months ago, she decided to go off on her own and she opened her own arepa factory, that she has been building little by little, as capital availability has permitted. Maria Zoraida now sells her arepas to stores and families in her town. Thanks to this, she generates income to support her home with her husband. The way that Maria Zoraida makes her arepas is still very artisanal, because she doesn't have the machinery or the tools to produce her arepas industrially. This causes her to not be able to produce great quantities and she still has to sell her product in small quantities. Thanks to her arepas being much in demand by her customers, who have made orders she can't fill due to low production capacity, Maria Zoraida is motivated to buy some industrial machinery and tools for arepa production, as well as outfitting her workplace.

However, her desire to do well has allowed her to overcome her difficulties and make progress together with her family.  Seven years ago Eugenia's husband died and she was left as a single mother responsible for 5 children, most of whom still needed their mother's care.  Seeing that she needed to make income for her household, Eugenia started offering a dressmaking service to third parties.  She learned this trade a long time ago and used to work in it periodically.  Thanks to the good quality of her products, Eugenia's work became the standard in her region and now she has very good orders from her customers.  She currently has a large order to make uniforms as the beginning of the school year is approaching.  For this reason, she is looking to buy the raw materials she needs such as fabric and threads.  As she doesn't have enough capital to buy all the materials she needs, Eugenia hopes to receive a loan which will enable her to buy fabric and threads for making the uniforms that her customer has ordered.\r\n\r\nEugenia dreams of her workshop continuing to grow and being able to provide work in the future to single mothers who find themselves in the same situation as her.  She also dreams of her children becoming professionals with good jobs that will allow them to get ahead in life and form their own families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":998177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials such as fabric and threads for making uniforms that a customer has ordered","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Rionegro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81747},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84049},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86415},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88848},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91349},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93921},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96565},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99284},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102079},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104953},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107908},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110946},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114070},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117281},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120585}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":165441,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":169218.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075673},{"amount":48.11,"local_amount":84902,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":86840.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326757},{"amount":105.07,"local_amount":185422,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":189655.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432145},{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":90564,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":92631.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432807},{"amount":54.72,"local_amount":96581,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":98786.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617298},{"amount":116.4,"local_amount":205415,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":210105.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640234},{"amount":122.66,"local_amount":216453,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":221395.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165475},{"amount":257.97,"local_amount":455222,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":465616.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097990}],"funded_date":"2012-03-01T22:17:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":387943,"name":"Jesus Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jesus Antonio es una persona ampliamente reconocida en su municipio gracias a que es una persona muy carism\u00e1tica y muy trabajadora.

Jorge se encuentra casado y es padre de 1 hijo, el cual por su corta edad requiere de mucha atenci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n genera grandes gastos para su familia, es por esto que Jorge siempre busca aumentar sus ingresos para poder ofrecerle a su hijo un crecimiento de calidad y a su esposa ofrecerle una mejor calidad de vida. Jorge en la actividad de la instalaci\u00f3n de redes de gas es muy eficiente, y gracias a esto es muy reconocido entre sus clientes y esto le ha llevado a tener muy buenos contratos. Sin embargo, la actividad tiene muchos tiempos muertos, donde Jorge no encuentra contratos para desarrollar su actividad y tiene conflictos para la generaci\u00f3n de ingresos para su hogar. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Jorge ha aprendido la actividad de la instalaci\u00f3n de redes el\u00e9ctricas y gracias a esto ha podido diversificar su trabajo y poder tener menos riesgo a quedarse sin ingresos para su hogar.

He learned this trade from a family member and it makes him the income he needs to support his household.  Jorge is married and has one child who, because of his young age, needs a lot of care and also creates large expenses for his family.  For this reason, Jorge is always looking to increase his income so that he can offer his son a good childhood and offer his wife a better quality of life.  Jorge is very efficient in his work as a gas installer and he is very well known among his customers.  This has meant that he gets very good contracts.  However, the business has many times when there isn't much work and Jorge cannot find contracts.  This makes it hard for him to make income for his household.  With the aim of improving this situation, Jorge has learned how to work as an electricity installer and has been able to diversify his work so that he runs less risk of being unable to make income for his household.  Now that he carries out this business well, Jorge would like to buy some work tools.  He is looking for a loan that will enable him to buy tools for carrying out his work as an electricity installer.  This will give him an additional source of income on top of the money he makes installing gas lines.\r\n\r\nJorge hopes that a lack of income will no longer cause him problems as he is finding a lot of work in this new business.  This means he will be able to offer his family a better quality of life and financial stability which will give them more opportunities for making progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":998681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools so that he can carry out an additional business installing electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123134},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":126607},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130178},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133851},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137626},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":141509},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":145501},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":149605},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":153825},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":249895,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256320.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075681},{"amount":153.22,"local_amount":268131,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275025.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326763},{"amount":161.18,"local_amount":282063,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":289316.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378194},{"amount":79.03,"local_amount":138317,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":141873.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432813},{"amount":263.77,"local_amount":461594,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":473463.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640240}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T22:08:10Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":395272,"name":"No\u00e9lie Afiavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"M\u00e8re de deux enfants, No\u00e9lie Afiavi vit en location avec son mari.

","en":"Olimjon is an honest and hard-working family man and a father of four.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he privatized the plot of land cultivated by his parents. Olimjon has many years of experience not only in livestock breeding but also in agriculture. Unfortunately, his business has been affected by the crisis in the country.

De esta manera, Libardo afirma que el genera sus ingresos y a la vez le brinda una ayuda a los agricultores porque ellos no tienen como llevar sus productos hasta la ciudad, y la empresa que hace esto, para la que trabajaba Libardo, abusaba del trabajo de los Agricultores. Libardo le compra la mercanc\u00eda a los agricultores a cr\u00e9dito, pues no cuenta con un buen capital para poderla comprar a contado, sin embargo, Libardo quiere cambiar esta situaci\u00f3n, pues a menudo los agricultores necesitan el dinero para poder sostener sus propios gastos.

He is married and the father of six children to whom he has always given a good education, offering them the best he could.  For approximately ten years Libardo has been buying and selling fruit and vegetables.  He learned the trade while working for a company in the sector, but since he felt his job was not well paid he decided to become independent and set up his own business.  Libardo buys produce from farmers near his home and then travels to the city to sell it at the markets.  This way Libardo generates his own income and also helps the farmers because they have no way of transporting the goods to the city.  The company that does this type of thing, which is where Libardo worked before, used to abuse the farmers.  Libardo buys from the farmers on credit since he does not have enough capital to buy in cash.  But he wants to change this situation because the farmers sometimes need cash to cover their own expenses.  So Libardo is requesting a loan to buy fruit and vegetables in cash, which means the farmers will receive cash and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe is also hoping to improve his own quality of life since the farmers will be better off and this will benefit the region in the future.

Her parents taught her the trade at the age of 18 when she used to go with them to the fields and learned how to grow corn, squash, etc.  Now she does her own farming which is the source of income for her household.  She has to travel by bus, a 45-minute ride, to the city where she buys farm supplies with her children.\r\n\r\nThe loan Santos is requesting is to buy four sacks of sulphate, two sacks of formula and the rest to buy a calf.  With this investment she will be able to plant corn and squash, which are her two main crops.  With the income from the squash she will pay back the loan.  The rest will be used to buy more livestock since now she has 12.  In the future Santos wants to buy another motor to make crop irrigation quicker and production more abundant, so she can give her children an education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":998757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy four sacks of sulphate, two sacks of formula and use the rest to buy a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos De Los \u00c1ngeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":124.15,"local_amount":124.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":124.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033183},{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":59.17,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645394},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":61.08,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":61.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491844},{"amount":65.5,"local_amount":65.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":65.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736381},{"amount":65.38,"local_amount":65.38,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":65.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561665},{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":66.77,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":66.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390777},{"amount":68.17,"local_amount":68.17,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":68.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399902},{"amount":68.95,"local_amount":68.95,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":68.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382983},{"amount":420.83,"local_amount":420.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":420.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990067}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T20:26:45Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":387831,"name":"Hovhannes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hovhannes is 26 years old.

For approximately 20 years he has been running his own metal shop, making acrylic and steel tiles.  Due to circumstance beyond his control he had to close his business and move to another city to find more employment opportunities.  Around six months ago he moved back home and wanted to start making his acrylic and steel tiles again, but did not have the tools, work space, or raw materials.  With much effort and hard work he was able to get ahead and acquire new machinery.  But he still has very little raw materials and works out of a rental space which does not offer all the services he needs to do his job.  Now that Eduardo has a larger order to fill he wants to take advantage of the situation to generate more income so he can move to a better location, where he can work more comfortably and have access to services.  To fill the order he needs to buy raw material, but does not have enough capital to do so.  So he is requesting a loan to buy acrylic and steel to be able to manufacture the order.\r\n\r\nEduardo hopes to be able to move to a more suitable location so he can continue his work.  His goal is to have a better lifestyle and be able to offer employment through his workshop to people who need a

Carmen had to support him on her own.\r\n\r\nBecause Carmen was not employed and was only studying, she had to abandon her studies.  She had to find employment that would allow her to generate sufficient income to be able to support her son\u2019s expenses.  Carmen then learned the business activity of selling personal products like deodorants, creams, and lotions, among others, and selling clothes.  She makes all of these sales through catalogs.  Thanks to this she is able to generate income.\r\n\r\nThe work has served Carmen well because it gives her good income, and it does not require her to be available full time.  This allows her to spend time with her son and to be able to take care of him while he is growing up.  Thanks to the good service that Carmen offers, her sales have increased more and more.  Thanks to this her family is able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe currently has a large clothing order from one of her customers.  She needs to buy merchandise from her provider, but she does not have enough money to make this purchase.  That is why she hopes that a loan will give her the opportunity to buy clothes to respond to the large order her customer has made.\r\n\r\nCarmen hopes that this way she will be able to continue generating enough income to be able to support her son and provide him with what he needs to grow up well.

For ten years he has been involved in agriculture which he learned from his cousins when his father died.  He was only a boy then and grew up alone with his mother so at an early age he had to work to provide for the household.  He gets up at 5:00 a.m. to have breakfast, then walks with the cows for an hour to his land where he works seven hours before returning home.  He buys his farm supplies in a village that is an hour and a half away by road, but he has to walk 30 minutes to meet the truck that will take him there.\r\n\r\nThe loan Miguel is requesting is to buy four young bulls since his cropland is covered with weeds.  He must tame the bulls and put them to work on his land which he needs for his crops.  This means he will save money since he usually has to pay for this work.  He wants two bulls to work and two for fattening.  What he wants most is to have his team of oxen and be able to save enough to leave a team of oxen for each son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":998777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy four young bulls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T15:40:05Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":635,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":635}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":635,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069173}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T02:16:57Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":388011,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa is married with three children.

Going forward she is thinking of expanding her chicken coop and being a powerful client in chicken sales in her region, and also providing a better life for her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":998805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 50 chickens, and the rest of the money will be for making pastries (donas).\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.78,"local_amount":120.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033184},{"amount":61.78,"local_amount":61.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645395},{"amount":61.92,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736382},{"amount":555.52,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":555.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561666}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T06:36:11Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":388036,"name":"Beatriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatriz is from the village of Cabisera 15.

She will use this loan to buy fertilizer for her farm and additional grocery items to sell, such as detergent, food, etc. She hopes to earn more income so that she can enlarge her farm and improve her living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":998421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and additional grocery items to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ratanak Mondul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chanrasy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidaert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saveth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":4200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4271400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265442}],"funded_date":"2012-03-01T21:40:00Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T16:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":392571,"name":"Belkis Candelaria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Belkys  con su nuevo credikiva comprar\u00e1 materias primas e inusmos para elaborar sus deliciosas comidas, porque se acerca la temporada de carnaval, donde se aumentan sus ventas especialmente en su restaurante.

Katerine's goal is to grow her business even more and she is achieving this with good service as well as offering a hygenic, fresh palate-pleaser. Her clients referred her since her working capital is insufficient to accomodate the growing demand. This is why she is applying for a loan, her first with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will purchase products for the preparation of food as well as drinks to be able to respond to the unsatisfied demand of the area. She is taking advantage of the fact that Carnavales are approaching and sales usually increase in this season; it is for this reason that Katerine needs her business to be well-stocked.

dedicaba a esta actividad y se la ense\u00f1\u00f3 a su hijo desde que era muy joven. Hernando poco a poco ha ido incrementando la cantidad de ganado que tiene en su tierra y gracias a esto ha podido generar m\u00e1s ingresos para el sostenimiento de su familia. Gracias a la buena calidad y el buen servicio que ofrece Hernando, sus clientes quedan muy satisfechos y por esto con el pasar del tiempo ha ido captando m\u00e1s clientes para su negocio. Debido a que ahora tiene m\u00e1s pedidos de sus clientes de los que puede satisfacer, busca poder incrementar la cantidad de ganado que cr\u00eda en su tierra y poder ofrecerles a sus clientes una buena venta. Sin embargo, como no cuenta con el capital suficiente para la compra de los nuevos ganados para la cr\u00eda, Hernando aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de ganado que le permita incrementar su capacidad productiva para poder responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.\n\nHernando espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten y le permita ofrecerle a su esposa una mejor calidad de vida. Adem\u00e1s, Hernando sue\u00f1a con poder tener una gran parcela donde pueda emplear a otras personas que est\u00e9n en situaciones muy vulnerables y nunca hayan encontrado oportunidades laborales.\n","en":"Hernando has been raising cattle since he was very young. His father also did this and taught his son from an early age. Little by little, Hernando has been increasing the quantity of cattle he has on his land and thanks to his effort, he has been able to generate more income to sustain his family. The good quality and service he offers has resulted in customer satisfaction and with the passage of time, he has won over additional customers for his business.\r\n\r\nSince Hernando now has more customer orders than he can satisfy, he is looking for ways to increase the quantity of cattle he raises on his land, and to offer his customers good sales. However, since he lacks sufficient capital to buy new cattle to raise, Hernando is seeking a loan that would offer the possibility of buying the cattle necessary to increase his productive capacity, allowing him to fill his customers' orders.\r\n\r\nHernando hopes in this way to increase his income and offer his wife a better quality of life. In addition, Hernando dreams of obtaining a larger parcel of land where he could employ other people who are in very vulnerable situations and have never found work

Maricella ha trabajado durante gran parte de su vida la venta de productos de uso personal a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos, sin embargo, hace aproximadamente 3 a\u00f1os cuando el padre de su hijo dej\u00f3 de contribuir con los ingresos para su hogar, tuvo que buscar la manera de generar mayores ingresos. De all\u00ed mont\u00f3 una tienda de calzado, donde adem\u00e1s sigue ofreciendo los productos de uso personal. La tienda la tiene ubicada en su residencia lo que le permite atender a su hijo mientras trabaja. Maricella es reconocida por la buena atenci\u00f3n que ofrece a sus clientes y por la buena calidad de sus productos, y gracias a esto ha podido captar una muy buena clientela, algunos de ellos, compran sus productos al por mayor. Actualmente tiene un gran pedido por parte de un cliente que no alcanza a satisfacer con el inventario que tiene, por esto debe hacer la compra de la mercanc\u00eda a su proveedor para satisfacer el pedido de su cliente. Debido a que no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar la compra a su proveedor, Maricella busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita acceder a la compra de productos de calzado para satisfacer un gran pedido que le ha hecho un cliente.\n\nMaricella espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 seguir trabajando en su negocio con m\u00e1s capital que antes.

However, when the father of her child stopped contributing money to the household about three years ago, she needed to search for a means of generating greater income.  From that point, she set up a shoe store where she continues also to offer personal care products for sale.  Her store is located in her home, which allows her to look after her child while she is working.\r\n\r\nMaricella is well-known for the good service that she provides her customers, and for the good quality of her products.  Thanks to this, she has been able to capture a very good customer base, some of whom purchase her products at wholesale.  She currently has a large order on behalf of a customer which she cannot cover with her current inventory.  For this reason, she must purchase the merchandise from her supplier in order to be able to meet her customer's order.  As she doesn't have sufficient capital to make this purchase from her supplier, Maricella is looking for a loan that will allow her to make this purchase of footwear, in order to meet the large order that her customer has placed.\r\n\r\nMaricella hopes that in this way her income will grow considerably, as she will be able to continue working on her business with more capital than before.  She also dreams that her son might achieve a quality education and have financial stability in the future, so that he won't have to experience the difficulties that she has had

Yaqueline se dedica desde aproximadamente 6 a\u00f1os a la venta de ropa como jeans, buzos, camisetas, chompas, entre otros, y gracias a esto genera sus propios ingresos.

Yaqueline ha presentado un inconveniente que es la recuperaci\u00f3n de su cartera, pues a veces sus clientes se retrazan en sus pagos y esto hace que se quede sin capital para seguir trabajando, sin embargo, esta dificultad la ha venido superando creando una cultura de buen pago entre sus clientes. Gracias a que un cliente le ha hecho un gran pedido de sus productos, Yaqueline requiere comprar a su proveedor la mercanc\u00eda, pues con el inventario que tiene no le es suficiente para satisfacer el pedido de su cliente. Es por esto que Yaqueline tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brindar\u00e1 la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de ropa para satisfacer un gran pedido que le ha hecho un cliente.\n\nYaqueline espera poder seguir generando ingresos para su hogar, de modo que les pueda mejorar la calidad de vida a sus padres.

In spite of the fact that Yaqueline works for a company during most of the day, in her free time she works in her business with the desire to make progress in it and, in the future, depend solely on it.  Yaqueline has been selling clothing such as jeans, track suits, t-shirts, sweaters, etc. for approximately six years.  Thanks to her business, she is able to make her own income.

Yaqueline faces a difficulty in recovering her portfolio because sometimes her customers fall behind in their payments and this means that she has no capital with which to continue working.  However, she has been overcoming this difficulty by creating a good repayment culture amongst her customers.  Thanks to the fact that a customer has made a large order for her products, Yaqueline needs to buy merchandise from her supplier because she doesn't have enough stock to fill the order.  She hopes to receive a loan which will allow her to buy the clothing she needs to fill this big order from her customer.\r\n\r\nYaqueline hopes to be able to continue making income for her household so that she can improve her parents' quality of life.  In addition, she dreams of growing her business and being able to open a large store where she can create jobs for those most in need.

Edis Breidy con 37 a\u00f1os de edad, se encuentra casado y es padre de 1 hijo a quien siempre le ha querido ofrecer una educaci\u00f3n de calidad. Edis Breidy ha tenido que atravesar muchas adversidades en su vida, sin embargo las ganas de salir adelante le han permitido superarlas y continuar con su vida. Edis Breidy se ha dedicado gran parte de su vida a la conducci\u00f3n, y gracias a esto ha generado los ingresos para su familia, sin embargo, estos no son suficientes para poder cubrir todas las necesidades de su familia. Es por esto que Edis Breidy esta montando una tienda general la cual le permita generar ingresos extras y poder as\u00ed alternar la actividad de la conducci\u00f3n con la atenci\u00f3n de su negocio generando mayores ingresos para su hogar. Edis Breidy inici\u00f3 con muy poco capital el montaje de su tienda, pero poco a poco ha ido surti\u00e9ndola con m\u00e1s productos de la canasta familiar. El mayor inconveniente que ha encontrado Edis Breidy es la numerosa competencia que hay en su regi\u00f3n, y esto ha hecho que captar sus clientes sea un duro trabajo. Con el \u00e1nimo de seguir surtiendo su tienda, Edis Breidy busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar los cuales le permitan aumentar los productos que ofrece en su tienda, y terminar de montar el negocio. \n\nEdis Breidy espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender m\u00e1s necesidades de sus clientes. Adem\u00e1s, espera con los ingresos extras provenientes de su tienda, poderles ofrecer a su esposa y a su hijo una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades de progresar econ\u00f3micamente.\n","en":"Edis Breidy is a person described as being very hardworking and always looking for a better quality of life for his family. He is 37 years old, married and the father of a son for whom he has wanted to provide a quality education. He has had to face many adversities in his life however his desire to get ahead has enabled him to overcome them and continue on.\r\n\r\nEdis Breidy has spent a large part of his life in transportation and thanks to it has generated income for his family. Nevertheless this is not enough to cover all the family\u2019s needs. Consequently, Edis Breidy is opening a general story which will enable him to generate extra income for his home by alternating his time between driving and running his store. He began with very little capital however, little by little, he has supplied his store with more household basic necessities. The greatest drawbacks he has encountered are the numerous competitors in his area. This has made attracting customers a difficult task. With the goal of continuing to stock his store, Edis Breidy will use his loan to buy essential household supplies thereby expanding the products he offers in his store and completing the inventory for his business. \r\n\r\nEdis Breidy hopes that in this way his income will greatly increase since he will be able to meet more of his customers\u2019 demands. As well he expects that the extra income from his store will enable him to provide his wife and son a better quality of life and greater opportunities to succeed economically."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1002258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

After that, Esperanza does her household chores.  At 10 a.m., she goes to purchase already-baked bread from a place five kilometers from her home.  She then transports it to her home where her neighbors purchase bread.  Afterwards, she goes door-to-door selling bread, finishing at 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to replace the rotten wood and the tiling of the roof of her house, as it is in bad condition, and it is almost the start of winter.  With the investment, they will no longer have problems with their appliances getting damaged by water coming through the roof, as they have already had a television damaged by the roof leaking.\r\n\r\nWhat Esperanza wants is to have a sound roof which will cope with the inclement nature of winter weather.  In order to have a more secure home, she wants to build brick walls, which will be able to last longer as currently the walls are made of adobe."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1002466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to replace the rotten wood and tiling of the roof of her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.64,"local_amount":56.64,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":56.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033194},{"amount":28.78,"local_amount":28.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":28.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645404},{"amount":29.09,"local_amount":29.09,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491854},{"amount":29.84,"local_amount":29.84,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":29.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736389},{"amount":31.34,"local_amount":31.34,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":31.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561674},{"amount":31.07,"local_amount":31.07,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":31.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390786},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":32.94,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399909},{"amount":360.3,"local_amount":360.3,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":360.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382990}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T22:38:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":388585,"name":"Sophan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophan is 37 years old and widowed.

Since her husband\u2019s income is not enough to cover the household expenses, Olivia decided to set up a store, providing customers with all of the basic household goods. The store has been in operation for a long time, and little by little, it has seen a considerable increase in sales. \r\n\r\nOlivia had the excellent idea to offer home delivery. Thanks to that, her store has grown stronger in her region. Right now, deliveries make up a large portion of the store\u2019s income, and sometimes the deliveries are delayed due to the large number of requests. Olivia wishes to take out a loan to be able to buy a motorcycle. This would allow her to make more deliveries in less time and serve more people. Olivia hopes that with a motorcycle, her store will continue to grow and continue to be recognized in her region, and she will be able to continue increasing sales.

This town is known for its exquisite shrimps, its clams and the charm of its residents, who always offer their traditional rolls, alfajores and oquendos. It is the world's number one producer of rice by hectare and in large quantities. Among such great production is the Tacuar\u00ed rice, which is the best and most tasty kind of rice. Apart from the best rice, it also has the most tasty beans, and its beaches are the vastest and clearest of the southern area of the country. Experts say that they are the most beautiful beaches in the south, with a lot of potential nationwide. During his free time, Walter enjoys listening to music, especially classical music, because it is very soothing. Besides, being a good Peruvian, he very much likes the typical food, and one of his favorite dishes is the delicious \"lomo saltado\" (stir-fried steak and potatoes).\r\nWith a lot of hard work and most of all with support from his wife, who's his right-hand person, he was able to start his business providing decorations, rental sound equipment and also catering for events. He's very hardworking, but it is mostly his wife who encourages him to keep going in spite of the obstacles he may face. She was also the one who gave him the idea to be in this line of work. He may work up to 12 hours a day, depending on what type of event they're working on. He believes that his business is doing well because he's very responsible and, above all, because he's honest and kind to his customers.\r\nWalter gives thanks to Kiva lenders for their help, because thanks to that he will purchase plates, cutlery, tablecloths and napkins for his business, so that he can improve his services and increase his profits.

She comments that she learned the sales business by herself - necessity taught her to make sales and not to sell off her fruit cheap. Gerarda is married to Gilberto, who grows poinsettias. They have seven children and their problem is their house, which is made of wood. They live in a hazardous area on a hill, and she's afraid that it could collapse and they could become homeless, and she's also afraid something could happen to them. She says that she wishes to use the loan to purchase soil for cultivating poinsettias. She also wants to purchase flowerpots and compost in order to get a very good production this year, since she sells the flowers in the state of Mexico.

has been an entrepreneur for over seven years.  She sells children's shoes.  Following her husband's death, she was left with four adolescent children, with her oldest daughter being ten years old.  Gulnora started to work as a dishwasher at various cafes and restaurants and earned a miserly salary, which was only enough for food.  She requested a loan from \"IMON International\", and her first loan was for 5000 Somoni.  Thanks to the loan, she gradually increased merchandise and expanded her business.  This success allowed her to marry off her daughter.  Gulnora is requesting a loan in the sum of 13,000 Somoni to expand her merchandise selection.

Debido a que en los \u00faltimos meses ha tenido muy buenas ventas, su negocio ha disminuido el inventario, es por esto que Otoniel aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de frutas para poder ofrecer a sus clientes mayor variedad de productos. \n\nOtoniel espera que sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente y de esta manera pueda ofrecerle a su hija una mejor calidad de vida y una mejor educaci\u00f3n. Otoniel sue\u00f1a con que su negocio crezca y pueda expandirse hacia otros sectores y de esta manera pueda generar empleo para las personas que m\u00e1s necesitan de unos ingresos. \n","en":"Otoniel left his birthplace approximately 13 years ago to seek better employment opportunities and improve his economic situation.  He takes care of his daughter and must guarantee all her needs are met ever since her mother left them some time ago.  Otoniel established himself in the city of Medell\u00edn where he set up a fruit stand, offering whole and sliced fruit in order to generate an income to support his household.  Because of his attentiveness and the quality of his products, Otoniel has been able to gain many customers which means sales are good on many occasions.  And since sales have been high over the last few months his inventory has decreased, so Otoniel is requesting a loan to to buy more variety of fruit for his customers.\r\n\r\nOtoniel is hoping to increase his income considerably so he can give his daughter a better lifestyle and a good education.  His goal is to grow his business and diversify into other areas so he can generate employment for people who need an income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1003597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Desde el nacimiento de su hija, Wilma tuvo que dejar su empleo en una empresa para poder estar al cuidado de ella, es por esto que se vio en la necesidad de generar un empleo en el que pudiera estar al cuidado de su hija al mismo tiempo que en la atenci\u00f3n del negocio. Es por esto que Wilma mont\u00f3 una papeler\u00eda en la casa donde vive y gracias a esto genera los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar. Wilma poco a poco ha ido sum\u00e1ndole variedad de productos que ofrece en su papeler\u00eda, y actualmente ofrece cosm\u00e9ticos, prendas de vestir y bisuter\u00eda, lo que ha hecho que pase de ser una simple papeler\u00eda a ser una miscel\u00e1nea; gracias a esto ha podido captar una mayor cantidad de clientes. Con el \u00e1nimo de seguir aumentando la variedad de mercanc\u00eda que ofrece en su miscel\u00e1nea, Wilma aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de bisuter\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos y prendas de vestir, y poder as\u00ed ofrecer mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes.\n\nWilma espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender m\u00e1s necesidades de sus clientes. Wilma espera poder ofrecerle una mejor calidad de vida a su hija y sue\u00f1a con que pueda ingresar a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria. \n","en":"Wilma is noted for being a very hard-working person.  She has faced some difficulties in life but she has been able to overcome them and make progress.  She is a single mother and has a 17-year-old daughter.  \r\n\r\nWilma has had to provide her daughter with a decent upbringing on her own as her daughter's father never made any financial contribution towards her upkeep.  When her daughter was born, Wilma had to leave her job in a company in order to look after her.  She needed to create work for herself so that she could care for her daughter as she worked.  She therefore decided to set up a stationery store in her home.  This business makes her the income she needs to support her household.  Wilma has gradually added a greater variety of products to her store and currently sells cosmetics, clothing and costume jewelry as well.  This has turned her humble stationery store into a 'miscel\u00e1nea' (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods).  As a result, she has gained a large number of customers.  With the aim of continuing to increase the variety of merchandise that she sells in her store, Wilma would like to take out a loan which will allow her to buy costume jewelry, cosmetics and clothing.  This will enable her to provide her customers with a larger variety of products.\r\n\r\nWilma hopes that this will increase her income significantly as she will be able to meet more of her customers' needs.  She hopes to be able to provide her daughter with a better quality of life and she dreams of her daughter going to university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1005103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Debido una gran crisis que tuvo durante un tiempo, Roberto se vio obligado a cerrar su taller y a trabajar la fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado para terceros. Gracias a su dedicaci\u00f3n al trabajo pudo salir delante de esta adversidad y retomar su taller aunque con muy bajo capital. Como los productos de Roberto se han caracterizado por su buena calidad, ha podido captar gran cantidad de clientes y poder sacar adelante su taller poco a poco. Actualmente, Roberto tiene muy buenas ventas, pero debido a la poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n de su taller a veces no puede responder a todos los pedidos de sus clientes. Con el \u00e1nimo de poder aumentar su capacidad de producci\u00f3n y responder a estos pedidos, Roberto aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de insumos y materias primas para la fabricaci\u00f3n de zapatos como son moldes, caucho, cuero, entre otros.\n\nRoberto espera continuar mejorando su taller y llegar a los niveles de ventas que ten\u00eda antes de caer en la crisis. Roberto sue\u00f1a con poder ofrecer m\u00e1s empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas, pues actualmente emplea dos personas que nunca tuvieron oportunidades laborales. \n","en":"Roberto has been making footwear for approximately 25 years.  He previously worked for a company but one day decided to start working for himself owing to the low wages he earned from his job.  He started making footwear in his own workshop and even reached the stage where he sends them abroad.   Owing to a crisis that he experienced which lasted a while, Roberto was forced to close his workshop and work making footwear for third parties.  Thanks to his commitment to his work, however, he was able to overcome his difficulties and re-open his workshop, albeit with very little capital.  As Roberto's products are very good quality, he has been able to attract a large number of customers and gradually make progress in his business.  He currently experiences very good sales but, owing to the low production capacity of his workshop, he sometimes cannot fill all of the orders from his customers.  With the aim of increasing his production capacity and filling these orders, Roberto is hoping to take out a loan which will allow him to buy the supplies and raw materials he needs to make shoes such as molds, rubber, leather, etc.\r\n\r\nRoberto hopes to continue improving his workshop and to reach the level of sales he enjoyed before he experienced his crisis.  Roberto dreams of being able to offer more jobs to people who need them most.  He currently employs two people who never had work opportunities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1005121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He always wants to offer his family a better quality of life. Javier is married and the father of one two year old son who is his motivation for working hard at his business every day. Javier works at a food stand. He learned to do this work because his sister had a food stand and she taught him about it. Javier put his locale where he can serve his customers more conveniently and this led to him increasing his sales considerably. Right now, Javier has good sales, to the point that he can't serve any more customers in his locale because it's at maximum capacity.  Javier wants to relocate to a locale that is nearby because it is bigger, and he needs to make some improvements on that locale so the kitchen will be more convenient and the locale more pleasing. That is why Javier is hoping for a loan to afford him the possibility os making improvements on the locale to make it more attractive and pleasing to his customers. \r\n\r\nJavier hopes that his income will increase considerably. He'll be able to us serve more customers that don't fit in his locale now. Javier hopes that the loan will allow him to continue his business without his monthly income being affected and in this way keep offering his son and his wife a better quality of life and better opportunities to progress. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1005224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to make improvements on his locale to make it more attractive and pleasing for his customers.

According to John Lester, the income generated from their farming business is utilized in their daily needs, tuition fees, and other school fees of his brother.  Due to high expenses of his family, the current capital in their farming business is no longer enough.  For this reason, he is asking for a loan amounting to P50,000 which will be used in buying farm inputs such as 18 cavans of fertilizers and insecticides for care of his rice crop.  Through this loan amount requested, John Lester could be able to make his rice field more productive and profitable.

He learned how to make handicrafts approximately six years ago when some craftsmen visited his town and he asked them to teach him.  Some Indians then visited his town and they taught him some additional techniques.  In this way, he acquired the knowledge he needed to make good-quality handicrafts.  With a lot of hard work, he managed to acquire some machines that he needs for making his handicrafts and started making his own income because he contacted some good customers.  Henry suggested training prisoners in his town so that they could work for him from prison.  In this way, he provided jobs for these people whose need is so great.  Henry currently experiences very good sales, to such an extent that he sometimes doesn't have enough capacity to meet all of his customers' requirements.  With the aim of increasing his production capacity, Henry is looking to take out a loan which will enable him to buy the machinery he needs to make his handicrafts.\r\n\r\nHenry hopes that his business will continue making good income so that he can offer his parents a better quality of life and have more opportunities for making progress.

Since then, Gloria has been earning her own income with this activity. From the beginning, she set up her own sewing shop where she has sewn items for third parties.\r\n\r\nGloria is married, and together with her husband she has been able to overcome great adversity in her life. Gloria went through a time of crisis, during which she had to close her business. However, her desire to get ahead allowed her to overcome the crisis, and she has been able to re-open her sewing shop. Gloria, who desires to continue improving her sewing shop so she can offer her customers the best service, is asking for a loan which will make it possible for her to buy an overlock sewing machine. This will allow her to offer better-quality service to her customers and make her dressmaking business more agile.\r\n\r\nGloria hopes that her business will return to its previous levels of sales and that it will be able to generate income so she can improve her family's quality of life. She also wants to create jobs for people who need them most.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1005324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to
