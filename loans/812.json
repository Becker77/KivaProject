Thanks to this, she has been able to contribute alongside her husband to covering the household expenses.  Blanca is the mother of two children, whom she has always wanted to provide with everything they need.  It is for this reason, and owing to the fact that the income earned by her husband wasn't sufficient to cover all the household costs, that Blanca decided to set up a sewing workshop where she provides sewing services to third parties.  Thanks to the good quality of the service that she provides, she has been able to gain a very good customer base, which has allowed her to have very good sales.\r\n\r\nBlanca currently wants to increase her sewing workshop's production capacity, with the goal of being able to pay for a university education for her younger son.  It is for this reason that she is hoping that a loan will provide her the opportunity of being able to purchase a sewing machine to increase her workshop's production capacity.\r\n\r\nBlanca hopes in this way that she can achieve her dream of having her children attain a university education, and additionally, to be able to improve her family's quality of life.

Factor Emilio, debido a las pocas oportunidades de empleo que se le presentan, decidi\u00f3 montar desde hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os una tienda general donde ofrece todo tipo de productos de la canasta familiar. Al principio montar la tienda fue un gran reto, pues Factor Emilio no contaba con el capital suficiente para esto, sin embargo, sus ganas de trabajar le permitieron poco a poco ir aumentando la variedad de productos que ofrece. Factor Emilio tiene el sue\u00f1o de poder llegar a tener un supermercado, por lo que cada vez que su tienda se lo permite le aumenta la variedad de productos que ofrece y le realiza mejoras locativas para cumplir este sue\u00f1o. En esta oportunidad Factor Emilio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para aumentar la variedad de productos que ofrece a sus clientes.\n\nFactor Emilio espera que con el pr\u00e9stamo su tienda pueda ofrecer mayor variedad y cada vez pueda estar m\u00e1s cerca de cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener un supermercado.

When she was young she started selling personal products to her family members and friends and this is how she covered the cost of her studies for some time.\r\n\r\nLeidy currently has a dressmaking workshop where she provides a dressmaking service to third parties.  Through her business, she makes the income she needs for her household.  Leidy has a big customer who places very good orders.  For this reason, she has always made the same item of clothing.  Thanks to the good quality of her work, she has been able to make contact with another big customer who needs her to make some different garments from those she makes for her current customer.

Desde entonces, Flor tuvo que empezar a generar mayores ingresos para sostener los gastos de su hogar, pues los ingresos que generaba anteriormente no le alcanzar\u00edan para el sostenimiento de sus gastos junto con su hijo. Flor trabajaba como empleada en una empresa de confecci\u00f3n, all\u00ed adquiri\u00f3 la experiencia y gracias a esto tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de independizarse y montar su propio negocio. Flor mont\u00f3 su negocio de confecci\u00f3n donde ofrece el servicio de confecci\u00f3n a terceros, y gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos, su taller tiene muy buen reconocimiento en su regi\u00f3n. Una de las m\u00e1quinas con las que trabaja Flor ya se encuentra un poco vieja, y ha hecho que Flor gaste mucho dinero en el mantenimiento que requiere. Es por esto que Flor busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina plana la cual le permita seguir trabajando sus productos con buena calidad.\n\nFlor espera que de esta manera sus ingresos mensuales aumenten, pues no tendr\u00e1 que generar tantos gastos por el mantenimiento de la m\u00e1quina vieja. Adem\u00e1s, Flor espera que con mayores ingresos le pueda ofrecer a su hijo una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades de progresar, adem\u00e1s de en un futuro acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad.\n","en":"Flor is a person who, in spite of the adversities she has faced, has had the strength to move forward and continue to progress in life.  Flor is a single mother and head of household.  She has a son who is four years old.  His father abandoned them without ever making a financial contribution.  Since then, Flor has had to start earning more income to cover household expenses since her earnings before weren't enough for both her and her son.  \r\n\r\nFlor used to work as an employee of a clothing company.  There she gained experience which allowed her to make the decision to work independently and to start her own business.  Flor set up a tailoring business, where she offers the service of manufacturing to third parties, a form of production that is set as a commitment by the owner of the production and \/ or a brand with the person performing the work.  Thanks to the high quality of her work, her shop is very well known in the area.  \r\n\r\nOne of the machines Flor works with is a little outdated, requiring that Flor spend a lot of money on its maintenance.  For this reason, Flor is seeking a loan that will permit her to acquire a new machine for manufacturing high quality products.\r\n\r\nFlor hopes that her monthly income will thereby increase and that she won't have to spend so much on the maintenance of the old machine.  Furthermore, Flor hopes that increased earnings will allow her to provide her son a better life and more opportunities for advancement, in addition to access to a quality education in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1006577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Ever since, Juan Fernando has been in charge of the forge and thanks to the good quality of his products and the good service he offers, the number of his clients has increased over time. Juan Fernando receives a very good number of orders through his forge and thanks to this, he has been able to generate an income for his home, but sometimes his clients place more orders than what he can fulfill because of his limited production capacity. With the objective of improving on this aspect, Juan Fernando wants to buy raw materials to increase his production capacity and be able to fulfill all the orders he receives. However, he cannot afford the purchase. This is why he requests a loan that enables him to buy raw materials like sheet metal for his forge.

As\u00ed \u00e9l tendr\u00e1 una casa segura, para comodidad de su familia y de \u00e9l, adem\u00e1s mantendr\u00e1 en buen estado lo que humildemente tienen.\n\nEn un futuro don Sergio ve a sus hijos preparados acad\u00e9micamente, se esfuerza d\u00eda a d\u00eda para poder brindarles esa oportunidad con la que \u00e9l no pudo contar. Adem\u00e1s manifiesta que ya no le gustar\u00eda trabajar para una ganader\u00eda ajena, dentro de sus metas est\u00e1n trabajar en ganado propio, para as\u00ed estar m\u00e1s cerca de su familia.\n\n\n","en":"Sergio is 29 years old, is married, and has two children: a 9-year-old boy and a girl who is about to turn 2 years old. Due to his economic situation, he started working at a very early age and, therefore, only attended school until third grade. His trade is farming, which he learned from his father. This helped him be able to produce grain for his family's consumption. During the dry season, he worked with his father in the livestock ranches in the area. In this way, he learned the livestock hand's trade, which is what he currently does. \r\n\r\nEvery day he gets up at 2:30 a.m. to go to work and returns home at 4:30 p.m. He buys agricultural supplies in his town, carts them by bicycle to a certain point on the road, and then carries them on his back. He does all this after his workday as livestock hand.\r\n\r\nSergio is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to build a house, as the one they are living in is in poor condition. Because the house is old, its adobe walls are deteriorating, and in the winter, water leaks in. It is not very safe, and each day he lives in fear that it will fall down. This way he will have a safe home for his family's comfort and his own. He will also keep the few things that they own in good condition.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Sergio sees his children well educated. He works daily to be able to provide them with that opportunity, which he did not have. He also says that he no longer wishes to work at another person's livestock ranch. One of his goals is to work with his own livestock so that he can be closer to his family.

His stitched bags are popular among his clients, and he receives regular orders. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan proceeds Razia\u2019s son will buy thread and cloth to make better quality bags and so increase his sales and profits. Razia is confident that by purchasing raw material in bulk her son will be able to improve his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1002662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in her own house together with her partner Jimi, who is 27, and their two beautiful children, Jim, who is 6 years old, and Kalef, who is 1, and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. Liliana is a determined woman and, along with her partner, works in the sale of spare parts for cars. They began this business six years ago, and they comment that it is going very well since, up to now, thanks to their good service and the best brands of parts that they sell, they have succeeded in obtaining a sufficient clientele. She sells the parts while her partner repairs some of the failures of the cars. The drivers don't doubt their work, because it brings them good results on the road. This work is profitable because every day they manage to sell a part, but it also has its difficulties, when they run out of the parts most needed by the drivers.

Marziya has five cows, but they are very thin and to fatten them up she needs grain. Grain is expensive at the local market, but to feed her animals Marziya decided to buy several bags of fodder for them. Marziya herself works at the local brick plant, according to her the brick making season starts in April. The owner of the plant pays Marziya 25 somoni per day.

For the last three years Stanislav has been growing early vegetables - tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Previously Stanislav lived in a big city in eastern Ukraine, but there was little work to be found there. That is why Stanislav moved to Kamenka and started his farming business.

vegetables in greenhouses. She has previously used the lending system to build a small greenhouse for seedlings. Currently she is requesting another loan of 15,000 griven to purchase seeds, plastic foil and fertilizer. \r\n\r\nYekaterina used to live in the city, but she inherited a house in the country from her parents.

Due to adverse conditions in rural areas, she was unable to receive proper education and so is unemployed. In order to somehow improve her living conditions, she raises livestock at home. Gulbahor's husband has left with his brothers to find work in Russia and sends money every month, but this is only sufficient for bare necessities. Gulbahor has asked her brother to help her with the purchase and resale of livestock. She tends to the animals herself, while her children help when purchasing fodder. Gulbahor would like to increase the size of her herd, and so has turned to MDO Arvand, LLC for

She is taking out a loan from Kiva for the first time. Mavluda is planning to use the loan to purchase more livestock for her herd. She currently lives with her husband's parents but is planning to build their own house as her children are growing up and it's time to live as separate families. In order to finance the purchase of a house Mavluda needs to save money. Mavluda's husband also helps with the livestock business as best as he can - he raises and sells livestock with her. Mavluda also sells milk and dairy products on the market. Her clients are her neighbors, acquaintances and relatives. She is very grateful for Kiva's support and hopeful that she will be able to improve her living conditions with this loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1013333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has one daughter who is 5 years old. She is married and works selling traditional clothing and also sells fried chicken and french fries. She has done this for 8 years. She tells us that she is requesting this loan to sell traditional clothing because the school year started and she wants to buy blouses to sell them. Furthermore, she also wants to invest in her french fries business because she wants to change the stove since the one she has is a little old. So she wants to send it to be repaired so she can continue selling because she is the only one in her sector who has this type of business. So on the weekends the people already know her and they come and they buy from her.\r\n\r\nThere is also Lidia del Rosario, she is 29 years old. She has two children in elementary school. She sells new and used traditional clothing and she also makes aprons. She has done this for 7 years. She tells us that in her sector where she lives she makes different types of needlework and people come to ask for them. Also now she has started to make traditional bags, so women can carry their things. She tells us that thanks to God they have been sold, but she needs to buy material (scraps of tunics and shorts) to make them and in order to do that she is requesting this new loan. The two women are confident that FAPE can continue supporting them in what they are asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1008482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy traditional clothing to sell.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Sacsuy, San Juan Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Olivia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.12,"local_amount":666.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":668.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016804},{"amount":86.84,"local_amount":672.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":673.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206863},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":666.16,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":667.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315897},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":668.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850815},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":333.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551653},{"amount":86.91,"local_amount":672.86,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":674.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377912},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":666.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":667.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308388050},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":674.26,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":675.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372540},{"amount":83.76,"local_amount":648.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":650.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981444},{"amount":43.05,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":334.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515781}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T22:12:53Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":399421,"name":"Komla","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Komla est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 35 ans.

La actividad que realiza Zoila es la costura oficio que aprendi\u00f3 estudiando en un centro de educaci\u00f3n ocupacional de joven, pero al cual no se dedicaba sino hace m\u00e1s de 10 que retom\u00f3 reci\u00e9n su oficio.

She is also a kind and sociable person who knows how to win the appreciation of the people with her charisma.  She lives with Manuel who is retired and the father of her 3 children, Niki, Ray and Jaqueline, at 19, 17 and 15 years of age respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they built with their efforts.  The activity that Zoila performs is dressmaking, an occupation that she learned by studying at a center for youth employment education, but which she did not at first pursue.  More than 10 years ago she took up dressmaking again.  Starting with one machine, she currently relies on more than 6 sewing machines for different finishes, offering quality work to her clients that leave satisfied and recommend her to other people.  She also sells clothes that she buys in the capital or that she makes, having in her business a space where she exhibits her products.  She carries out her work in her house, where her clients come and she attends them kindly.  She considers her business quite profitable due to the profits that she earns and the demand for her products.  Up to now she has worked alone, except from time to time when she supports her daughter who is learning to sew.  She decided to begin with this activity when she lost her job and needed a position to generate an income, besides which her neighbors requested her work when they saw her fine finished clothing.  Her age begins to cause her to tire when she is sewing in the same position all day, therefore she wants to invest the profits in a convenience store.  This will be her 16th loan with MFP.  She hopes for a small loan so that she can pursue her objectives.  On the other hand, she tells us that she is comfortable with her communal bank where she knows the members and considers them to be supportive and good people.  With the requested total of 1500 new soles she will invest in dressmaking materials such as fabric, thread, elastic and other such things.  She plans to purchase all these materials at a better price by buying in bulk.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1008530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy dressmaking supplies such as fabric, thread, and elastic.

","en":"Kelly, a 45-year-old, is a diligent and hard-working woman, besides which she is very attentive and kind with people.  She is separated from the father of her children, who are already grown and independent.  She lives in her own house in the company of one of her children,  Winston, age  10, whom she educates and endeavors to move ahead.  The activity that Kelly carries out is the sale of new clothes of good quality and past styles that are fashionable for ladies, gentlemen and children.  All these products are acquired in her trips to the capital and she sells them in her neice\u2019s house, offering also to her neighbors and friends who she treats in a cordial and kind manner, winning their favor and recommendation to other people.  She began her business over 3 years ago with a loan from MFP, and up to now she has worked in company with her niece who helps her to find new clients.  She considers her business profitable because of the profits that it earns which allow her to settle her expenses and pay for the education of her son.  She says that she began her business because she needed an income to settle her expenses, since she lacked enough to cover her needs.  Therefore, seeing the profits that she earns, she desires to invest in fruit juice to sell in the mornings, thus enlarging her income.  This will be her 18th loan with MFP.  The loan will allow her to continue with her objectives.  On the other hand, she tells us that she likes the work of her communal bank for the support that it offers to the people that need it.  With the requested total of 3000 new soles, she will invest in the purchase of various clothing, and snacks to sell from her house.

She is married to Noah who is a teacher and the father of her children, Alex, Carlos and Luis, ages 32, 30 and 28 respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they bought with their savings of many years.  The activity that Dora carries out is renting rooms and houses.  She has  land where she built two houses, one which is rented and the other with small rooms to rent, all occupied.  Her business was started 3 years ago with capital from her own savings, that she invested in their house thinking about their future including the support of their children that help her with the administration.  She considers it a quite profitable business due to the demand and that all her room s are occupied, and that it is work that does not need a lot of physical effort.  She decided to begin her business seeing that she was getting advanced in age and had the need to earn her own income to live on since she would not have access to employment or retirement.  Seeing the opportunity for the business, and the profits that it is achieving she is encouraged to invest in the purchase of more land to build a tourist hotel in the future.  This will be her 12th loan with MFP.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on financial support to advance with her business.  Besides she tells us that she is comfortable with her communal bank where she knows its members and considers them to be kind and responsible people.  With the requested total of 2000 new soles she will invest in the purchase of a pump for water valued at 1500 new soles to offer good service to her boarders so they will have permanent water service.  With the balance she will pay for the expenses of installation.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1008539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to install a well to have water all the time for her boarders.

She is separated from the father of her daughters, Elizabeth and Rosoli , ages 14 and 10 respectively, who she loves very much and who are her motivation to continue working.  Together they live in the house of her parents in the company of her mom and dad.  The activity that Liz carries out is selling beauty products such as nail polish, lipstick, facial creams, perfumes and other things.  All these products are acquired from a catalogue and she sells them to her neighbors, friends and family whom she attends in a kind and cordial manner managing to win their preference and recommendation to other people.  She also sells carbonated beverages and bottled water.  For this she relies on a refrigerator where she keeps all her products well chilled to the tastes of her clients.  She began selling fruits with her own capital, starting small, then stepping up to snacks and at present to carbonated beverages. She attends both businesses in her house.  \r\nShe considers her business quite profitable due to the profits that it earns.  Up to now she has worked alone, but from time to time her daughter tends it with her.   She decided to begin her business due to the need for an income to help to maintain her daughters, having recently been separated from their father.  Seeing the good results that she is having,  she wants to grow her stock of merchandise to see her business grow.  \r\nThis will be her 4th loan with MFP.  She is happy and thankful for the support that she will receive to continue with her plans.  On the other hand, she tells us that she likes the work of her communal bank because of the support that they offer people and considers it a responsible and supportive group.  With the requested total of 1000 new soles, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise such as beauty products and carbonated beverages to have an available stock for sale, seeking to obtain a good price by buying in bulk.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1008524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products and carbonated drinks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T04:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":158.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":177.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":181.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":153.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099708},{"amount":119.06,"local_amount":317.49,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713843},{"amount":64.13,"local_amount":171.02,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":172.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202736},{"amount":66.52,"local_amount":177.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":178.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098415},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":181.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":183.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401207}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T16:44:00Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":393471,"name":"Isabella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabella is 26 years old and married with three children.

Lucy's business is selling a range of merchandise such as clothing for men, women and children, as well as silver accessories such as bracelets, necklaces and rings. She buys all of these products in Lima through her aunt, and she sells them from her home to friends, family members and neighbors, in addition to people who are recommended to her. She has dedicated herself to this business for more than 6 years, and up to now she has done it by herself. She likes her business because of the income, the ability to set her working hours, and the feeling of independence, as she strives to become a prosperous business owner. She considers her business quite profitable because of the earnings it gives her. Thus, she plans to continue with her business and increase her stock of merchandise so her business will grow. This will be loan number 7 for her with the MFP institution. She hopes for your support so that she can carry out her plans. She also comments that she is happy with her communal bank, since they support people by providing lines of credit. With the requested amount of 2000 Peruvian new soles, she will invest in buying merchandise such as silver jewelry in order to have stock available to sell, looking for lower prices by purchasing in volume. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1008565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy silver jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":299.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":319.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":317.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":342.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":365.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":232.02,"local_amount":618.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":622.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099710},{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":317.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":319.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713845},{"amount":128.53,"local_amount":342.76,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":344.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202738},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":355.54,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":357.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098417},{"amount":136.95,"local_amount":365.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":367.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401209}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T13:37:40Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":393109,"name":"Maria Perpetuo Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es una persona que ha tenido que atravesar por muchas adversidades en su vida, sin embargo, sus ganas de salir adelante le han permitido superarlas y lograr salir adelante junto con su familia.

She now wants to expand her business and start to sell original parts and for different brands and models of vehicles. This will be her 15th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, so she hopes for collaboration so she can continue with her goals. She also pledges again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loans she\u2019s had. Also, she is happy to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are people who are responsible and supportive. With the requested amount of 3,000 soles (PEN), she will buy more merchandise to sell, including tires, inner tubes, motor oils, accessories, and other items. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1009184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy tires, inner tubes, motor oils, and accessories.

Seilita's work consists of providing manicures, pedicures and hair care to several friends, neighbors and relatives.  She has a small space in her home that she has turned into a beauty shop and also works in another salon.\r\n\r\nShe has been working independently for a year and in the other salon for three years.  She enjoys what she does because she has time to care for her daughter and also attend to extra customers who come by the house for her special manicures.

She lives with the father of her two children who are 15 and 7 years old.  Juana would like to provide her children with the best: the best education and the best quality of life.  The family live together in their own home that they worked very hard to buy.\r\n\r\nJuana's business is selling groceries and other basic household products.  She does this work from home.  She gets up early in the morning and heads to the market to buy products such as chicken, vegetables and some tubers.  When she gets back she displays the products on the sidewalk outside her home and starts selling.  Juana has been in this business for five years and she works alone.  At first it was a little difficult for her to start because she didn't have any knowledge of this business.  However, she learned over time and now she knows how to keep her customers happy.  What she enjoys about her work is that she can use her time to carry out other activities and when she has any spare time she is able to go to the market to sell some products (mainly sheets and bedspreads).  She is doing well in her business as she has a lot of customers which makes her good profits.  She hopes to be able to continue working and growing her business so that she can continue improving her financial situation.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's 11th loan from MFP and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support so that she can continue increasing her working capital.

Right now she lives alone but she works hard because she would like to enjoy a better future in her old age.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business is selling cooked food in a well-known market in the city.  She started this business in partnership with two of her daughters.  Before this she used to sell groceries from her daughter's house but it was not successful.

During the time that she has been carrying out this work, there are things that continue seeming strange to her and others that fill her with excitement.  She hopes to be able to grow the business together with her daughters and she feels that they are on the right path because they have been attracting many customers over recent months.  She still remembers six months ago when she started out in her new business, how she was full of doubts but also a lot of determination and hope.  All her efforts have paid off and now she is thinking of expanding her sales location so that she can make more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mar\u00eda's fourth loan from MFP.

This is the reason they work hard to give them a good education so they can be productive citizens.\r\n\r\nDelia is a seamstress and makes her own lycra fashions (lingerie, trousers, blouses).  Little by little she set up her small, industrious workshop in her own house, which she just bought.  She used to work for a man who was a distributor for a shopping center called El Huequito in the city, but over time she realized that she could make her own designs because she is quite good at what she does, as seen by her sales volume.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is that she receives a daily income and also can schedule her own time.  She is very happy with the loans she has had through MFP, which she says had a very low interest rate.  In the future she would like to have a larger workshop and begin distributing on a wholesale basis to shops in the city.  This is her third loan through MFP and she is glad she can count on financial support to continue increasing her work capital.  She believes she will be as responsible this time as she has been with previous loans.  She likes her communal bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive.

She separated from her partner many years ago and had to bring up her four children on her own.  Thanks to her perseverance and some sacrifices, she was able to ensure they became upstanding citizens who now live independently and, in some cases, help her with some of her expenses.  Susana lives in her own home where she is accompanied every day by her granddaughter, 13-year-old Alexandra, who she is bringing up and who she would like to provide with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nEvery day Susana gets up very early, does some household chores, and then opens her grocery store.  She knows that the earlier she opens, the more sales she will make and hence the more profits she will make.  Her business is located in her home and she has the help of her granddaughter who she is teaching that you have to work in order to obtain things, but without ever neglecting her studies.  Susana has been in her business for six years and it is doing very well.  She sells a lot and this allows her to make very good profits.  She hopes to continue working together as she is very keen to carry out her plans to expand her business and, in the future, have a mini-market or a larger and much better-stocked store.  However, she knows that the road is long and, in the same way that she started out one day with very little and is now doing better, she knows that she will have to work hard to achieve the goal that she has set herself.\r\n\r\nThis will be Susana's first loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support which will enable her to continue in her business as she would like to make gradual progress and grow her business.  In return for the support that she would like to receive, she pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  She does not want to let down the people who provided her with the support she needs and she would like to be able to quickly settle into her group as they are all responsible people.  Susana will use the 500 soles she has requested to buy more merchandise to offer her customers.  This will enable her to meet their needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1009273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products to stock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.23,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":166.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099744},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713875},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":85.47,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202771},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":88.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":95.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098447},{"amount":36.42,"local_amount":91.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":97.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401240}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T13:23:39Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":393493,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is 61 years old, she is a mother of two children.

She lives with her partner Luis who is a salesman and the father of her three children Jouliet, Luis and Luciano, who are 7, 5 and 1 and who she loves very much.  They live comfortably together in a rental house together with her sister and her nephew.\r\n\r\nAna's business is selling regional fruit and different flavored drinks.  Every day she sets up a table in front of her home where she places her fruit and drinks and then offers them for sale.  Her business is popular thanks to her kind manner and the good flavor of her drinks.  Ana started this business more than two years ago with a loan from MFP and, up to now, she has been working alone.  However, her sister sometimes supports her.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the income it makes her and how popular it is.  She decided to start this business because she needed work which would allow her to make her own income.  Sometimes her partner's income wasn't enough and so she took the decision to help him with their household expenses so that they could provide their children with a better quality of life.  Now that she sees the good results she is having, she would like to continue in her business and also start selling groceries.  She would like to open a store in her home for this.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ana's third loan from MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial support that she receives as it makes her feel more secure in making progress with her plans.  She also comments that she feels happy with her community bank as she considers its members to be cooperative and responsible.  Ana will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying soda to stock her business.  She will also buy a variety of fruit, seeking out affordable prices for her purchases so that she makes more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy soda and fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:30:07Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":160.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.12,"local_amount":306.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":308.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099746},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":160.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713877},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":172.24,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":173.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202773},{"amount":66.99,"local_amount":178.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":179.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098449},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.42,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":183.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401242}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T10:50:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":393511,"name":"Zulayya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zulayya is thirty-five years old and married with three children.

She lives with her two youngest daughters, ages 12 and 16. The oldest is independent and lives with her own family. She lives with her partner in their own home. She wants to provide her daughters with a better quality of life and offer them a good education. \r\n\r\nThe work that Nimia does is very complex. Her two occupations are selling fast food and ice-cold drinks. She has to get up early in the morning to seek out the largest, freshest chickens at the best prices. Then she prepares everything so that in the evening, she can sell along the path at her house with the help of her two daughters. She has worked in this business for over two years, and she likes it a lot because she can do her work alongside her daughters. She has taught her daughters from an early age to value responsibility without neglecting their studies. She feels that the business is worthwhile since she sells at least five chickens a day, generating a good income. When she started with the work, it was a little complicated since she did not know much yet. Before, she used to sell groceries. But with determination and energy, she was able to learn. Now she has one of the most exquisite fast foods in the city. One of the things that she would like to achieve is to grow her business and make it larger every day. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, so she hopes that though this collaboration she will be able to continue towards her goals. She commits once again to making her loan payments, just as she did with her previous loans. In addition, she is thankful to be a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and united. With the 600 Nuevos Soles (PEN), she will purchase ingredients and food to be able to continue with her work. She will also change some of the utensils she uses in her work. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1009265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients, chicken, and kitchen utensils.

She is also cheerful and kind to others.  She is married to Javier who is a teacher and the father of her children: 22-year-old Luis, 18-year-old Marvin and 8-year-old Karen.  They live comfortably together in their own home that Doylibeth bought with the support of her husband.\r\n\r\nDoylibeth's business is making and knitting clothing, tablecloths and bedspreads.  She learned this skill from her grandmother when she was very young.  She makes her items at home and sells them to her friends and family members, providing them with good customer service and thereby gaining their loyalty.  She also sells clothing, that her daughter sends her from the capital, at affordable prices.  Up to now she has been working alone but her children sometimes support her in collecting payment for her items.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable owing to the demand that she has for her products and the speed of her capital turnover.  This allows her to see her profits very quickly.  She decided to start her business because she needed an income to cover her expenses and pay for her children's education as her husband's salary wasn't enough to meet their increasing expenses.  Seeing the good results that she has experienced, she would now like to start another business, opening a grocery store in her home.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Doylibeth's fifth loan from MFP.

She is also friendly and kind to others.  She lives together with Denis who is a manual worker and the father of her two children Renzo and Sofia who are 4 and 1.  They live comfortably together in their own home that they worked hard to buy.\r\n\r\nMayja's business is selling food in the afternoons such as 'juanes' (a traditional chicken dish) and '<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Papa_rellena\">papas rellenas<\/a>'.  She prepares the food in her home and makes her sales as an itinerant vendor, walking with a tray through the sawmills near her home.  She started off selling 'mazamorras moradas' (a traditional pudding made from purple corn) and managed to increase her capital.  She then increased her business and started selling 'juanes' instead.  This was popular and she sold everything that she made.  Up to now she has worked alone.\r\n\r\nMayja considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the profits she makes and because she manages to sell everything she prepares.  She decided to start this business because she needed an additional income with which to support her partner as his income wasn't enough to cover their household expenses.  Seeing the good results that she has had, she would like to open a restaurant business in the future because she enjoys cooking.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mayja's fourth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support as she makes progress in her business.

To do this, she sets up a table every morning in front of her house, where she cordially serves her customers, who are her neighbors, earning their friendship.\r\n\r\nShe began more than two years ago with some capital of her own, and up until now she has had the help of her sister in serving customers. She feels that her business is fairly profitable because of the earnings that it gives her and the demand for her products.\r\n\r\nShe decided to begin her business because of the need to have an income to assist her partner with the household expenses and thus be able to offer a better quality of life to their children, whom she loves very much.\r\n\r\nTherefore, and seeing the good results she is having with her business, she wants to continue and maintain her business. This will be her second loan with MFP. For this she hopes for your assistance so that she can make her plans a reality. In addition, she is happy to be part of her communal bank because all the members are people who are responsible and very united. With the 1200 PEN that she has applied for, she will purchase the necessary merchandise for her business, such as fresh fruit, looking for low prices because of the volume of her purchases.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1009419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fruit\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":176.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":213.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":220.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.03,"local_amount":368.09,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":370.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099759},{"amount":74.46,"local_amount":198.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":199.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713890},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":199.93,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":201.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202786},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":213.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":214.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098460},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":220.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":221.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401255}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T19:52:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":393992,"name":"Phorn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a rural village of Thmor Kuol, is fifty-year-old Phorn, the mother of seven children.

She lives in her own house, where she raises her daughters and hopes to provide them with a better quality of life. Marlene's work consists of selling fruit. Every day she goes to the market in her city to look for the freshest and most nutritious fruits. She buys wholesale and from there goes to her house, where she has a stand to offer her products for sale. Besides being the only person who offers this variety of fruits, she also has a nice, friendly manner. Because of this, her customers come by every day, knowing they will find the fruit they're looking for at a good price. She has been doing this work for approximately two years, and she does it alone.\r\n\r\nAt first, it was very difficult for her to do this work, since having to get up in the early morning was very hard on her. With time, however, she learned to take time in the evenings in order to save herself time in the mornings. It is going very well for her. She has good sales, and that allows her to have good earnings. She hopes to continue working together and progressing, since her home finances are constantly improving. In the future she would like to increase her sales and offer a greater variety of products for sale. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, so she is hoping for a small loan to enable her to meet her goals. She is committed to once again making her payments in a very timely and responsible manner, as she did with the prior loan that she received. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank since all of the members are very good and supportive people.

She has a great desire to get ahead and to triumph in life.  She is married to Carlos, a transportation worker, and he is the father of their six children.  The children are ages 18, 17, 8, and 3 year old triplets.  They live together in a rented house.  She loves them dearly, and they are her motivation to work more as she looks to give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nElith sells medicine and other health products.  To do this she has a drugstore that she opened in a rented spot in the same place as the house that she rents.  This saves her more rental expenses.  She started her business over one year ago.  Her husband supports her with the money that she needed to buy the necessary merchandise.  There is a health clinic located in front of her business, and many times they do not have the medicines that the patients request.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is profitable because of the good income it gives her and the regular clientele that she has.  Before having her business she encountered financial hardships.  Her family grew very rapidly with the arrival of the triplets, and their expenses grew.  Their income was not enough, so they looked at alternative solutions.  They decided on this business.  Now it is going well for them, and they have overcome many of their financial hardships.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have plans to continue and to make it grow by getting more merchandise in order to have stock available to sell.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she can count on a loan to advance with her business.  She pledges to make her payments and to have a good credit record so that she can access more loans in the future.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she is comfortable working with her communal bank because of the support that they give to people who need it.  She will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy pharmacy products like medicine, pills, and others.  She will be looking for the best prices by purchasing in volume.  This way she can sell at lower prices, and she will be helping her customers with their needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1009410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":368.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":398.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":413.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":458.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":291.38,"local_amount":766.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":781.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099757},{"amount":157.17,"local_amount":413.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":421.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713888},{"amount":158.26,"local_amount":416.49,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":424.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202784},{"amount":168.94,"local_amount":444.56,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":453.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098458},{"amount":174.25,"local_amount":458.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":467.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401253}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T19:58:26Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":394454,"name":"Tahani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tahani is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Baha' appears in her Kiva profile photo.

To do so, she has a store installed in her house where she carries a wide and varied selection of products. She attends to her customers in a kindly and happy manner. Most are neighbors, and she wins their friendship.\r\n\r\nShe began her store more than 5 years ago with her own capital, buying goods in small quantities. Then the business grew, resulting in the growth of her working capital, and now the store requires her husband's help in his free time.\r\n\r\nTo begin her business she had to count on her own income to help with their household costs, since food prices constantly rose and they couldn't cover them. She saw her children suffer. Now, she feels tranquil with the income they have. Aidith considers her business sufficiently profitable from the earnings it provides, and the regular clientele she has learned to retain, achieving good sales.\r\n\r\nAs a result, seeing the good results they have achieved, Aidith wishes to continue her business and expand its space to hold a larger quantity of products.

She is also cheerful and sociable. She is separated from the father of her children. She lives comfortably with her two children, who are 25 and 28 years old, in the home of her mother, along with two newphews and their mother, all of whom she loves a great deal. Mar\u00eda's business activity is a printing service where she performs all types of graphical work, providing her customers with a high-quality service that earns her their business.\r\n\r\nShe began 30 years ago with her own capital. She saw that this would be a profitable business, given that there were few people providing this service, so she decided to open a printing business in her house. She obtained the machinery with her own capital, in partnership with her ex-partner. She currently has the support of her brother and his children to attend to the customers. She likes this business because it lets her see her family working together, provides her with income, and allows her to support herself. On the other hand, every day she finds this work more tiring due to her advanced age and a disease that has been affecting her for some time. She knows, however, that she needs to continue, as it is her only source of income. As well, she has plans with her children to expand the business and add a bookstore in the space that she has available in her house, in an attempt to increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP. Because of this she is hoping for their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans. As well, she says that she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people. With the requested amount of 1500 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in the purchase of materials to expand and prepare the space for the bookstore. With the balance, she will purchase printing materials, such as ink, card stock, and other items. She will be looking for the lowest prices to make her purchases in bulk with cash payment.

She is separated from the father of her children. She lives in her own house with her children, ages 15, 13, and 8, whom she loves a lot and wants to bring up well. Emma's business is the sale of secondhand clothing for women, men, and children. She acquires all these products in the commercial center of the city, and she sells them as a walking vendor, going through the little outlying towns located on the edges of the banks of the rivers. To do this, she travels until she finishes selling all her merchandise, no matter how long it takes. She began this business six years ago, investing some capital of her own, the fruit of her savings, because of the need to have an income to support her children, since the allowance that their father sends them is not sufficient. But now she has managed to increase her capital and she has the help of her son, who accompanies her on her sales.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the good earnings she obtains, since she sells at higher prices in these areas; in addition, she likes to sell and deal with people. For this reason, she plans to continue her business and expand into selling factory-made clothing, and in the future she would like to open a store to sell clothing in the city of Pucallpa, since she gets tired making her trips. This will be her fourth loan with MFP. For this she hopes for your help so that she can realize her plans. In addition, she comments that she feels good about her communal bank because she knows its members and considers them responsible and united people. With the 1800 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise for her business, such as secondhand women's, men's, and children's clothing. Thus she will have an available stock for sale, and she will seek lower prices by making her purchases in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1009423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more secondhand clothing for women, men, and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":264.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":288.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":287.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":310.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":321.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":328.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":207.24,"local_amount":552.63,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":555.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099761},{"amount":107.8,"local_amount":287.48,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":289.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713892},{"amount":116.27,"local_amount":310.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":311.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202788},{"amount":243.69,"local_amount":649.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":653.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401257}],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T16:50:27Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":394594,"name":"Yusra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusra is a conservative person so she was unwilling to upload her picture on the internet, thus the man in the photo is her son, Mo'ataz.\r\n\r\nYusra is a 42-year-old married woman from Al Hussein, Amman, Jordan and a mother of four children.\r\n\r\nYusra started her business years ago with a modest grocery store.

Maritza's business activity is the sale of all types of soft drinks. To do this, she opened a small location in her own house where she takes very nice care of her customers.

She is separated from the father of her children. She lives comfortably in her own house, along with two of her children: Eber and Iris, 22 and 28 years old, respectively, and with her 20-year-old granddaughter, Erika.\r\n\r\nRosario's business activity is the fabrication and sale of charcoal, made from wood scraps from nearby sawmills. She has a space near the sawmills where she gathers her wood scraps and sets them on fire, allowing the pile to burn for several days until the charcoal is ready for sale. The sales fulfill the various orders that she has, leaving her customers satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe began her business more than thirty years ago, starting slowly with her own capital, which she grew through significant effort. Up to the present time, she has continued in this work, with the help of her children for the preparation and sale of the charcoal. She considers her business profitable because of the good earnings that it provides to her, as well as the demand that allows her to sell all of her product.\r\n\r\nShe decided to begin this business because she needed to be able to count on income to support her family, given that she is both mother and father for her children. She managed to raise her children well and provide them with an education, which is her greatest pride. Seeing the good results and earnings that her business is providing, she would like to continue with it, as it is her only support. This will be her fifth loan with MFP. She is happy and thankful to know that she will be able to count on financial support to continue forward with her business.

She works in agriculture, growing coffee, cacao, and bananas on her plot of land, which is located 10 minutes from her home. Before devoting herself to this work, she was studying in the Huamanga province. Due to economic factors, however,  she was unable to complete her studies. Apart from that situation, she also met the man she now lives with, and, later, the little one arrived. Since she now had an additional responsibility, she decided to venture into agriculture.

The only downside is that moving their products is a little tedious, since they do not have their own means of transportation. \r\n\r\nBetzayda is thinking of someday making her living selling groceries and vegetables in her own community. \r\n\r\nThis is Betzayda's second loan with Kiva's partner MFP, and again she commits to cancel her debt.

She is separated from the father of her three children-- Henry who is 19 years old, Jennifer who is 14 years old, and Juana who is 3 years old-- who are her motivation to work. Together they live comfortably in their own home which she bought with the fruits of her labor. Margarita\u2019s business is selling meals which she makes in her home and brings to her customers at a civil construction site, and she collects payments weekly. Her customers are happy with the good flavor and the excellent service that she provides them with her punctuality.  \r\n\r\nShe began more than two years ago with a particular loan and so far she\u2019s had her kids\u2019 help with the transport and delivery of her orders. She feels that her business is very profitable due to the earnings it provides. On the other hand she says that she decided to begin her business due to needing a job in order to support her kids since she\u2019d separated from their father and the child support was not enough to cover costs. \r\n\r\nAbove all, now she\u2019s seeing good results, and she has plans to open a restaurant in the future in some rented shop in the commercial area of the city. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP, and so she hopes for their help in order to continue with her goals. She again promises to comply with the terms of her agreement as with previous loans she\u2019s had. Additionally, she likes her communal bank because she considers it to be a solid and unified group. She will invest the requested amount of 1000 nuevos soles in the purchase of ingredients to make her meals like rice, sugar, noodles, oil, and other things in bulk quantities and at lower prices in order to have better profits.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1009443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, noodles, oil, and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":144.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":178.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":184.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.26,"local_amount":304.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":306.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099767},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":166.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713898},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":167.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202794},{"amount":66.81,"local_amount":178.16,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":179.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098464},{"amount":69.19,"local_amount":184.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":185.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401263}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T16:31:29Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jodi Nelan","image":426481}},{"id":394749,"name":"Wallace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wallace is 23 years old.

He's a polygamous man with two spouses and four children. He lives with them in a large extended family in Mancourani I, in downtown Sikasso.\r\n\r\nAfter working several years as a taxi driver, he decided four years ago to learn his family's traditional trade, blacksmithing.\r\n\r\nHe purchases scrap metal and turns it into various objects: plows, seeders, carts, hoes, stock pots, etc.\r\n\r\nHe sells them at the weekly markets in several villages around Sikasso (N\u2019Tchongobougou, Kadiolo and H\u00e9r\u00e9makono), for cash and often on credit.\r\n\r\nHe's very much in demand and his customer's orders are constantly increasing, but his own resources are insufficient to meet his clientele's demands. \r\n\r\nIn order to correct this problem, he decided more than one year ago to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, from which he is now seeking his second loan, to be used to buy one ton of scrap metal.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, he foresees turning an average monthly profit of XOF 150'000 (ca US$ 300), to be mainly used to bolster his working capital, help with the family's expenses, and pay the interests of his loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1019972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural

Twenty years ago she started working in the fields.  During this large amount of time she acquired 12 parcels of land, which are spread out in different parts of her locality.

She harvests annatto in October and November, and she harvests oranges in December and November.  This way she generates income for her family for almost the whole year.\r\n\r\nHermelinda is intelligent.  She is now planning on planting another parcel of coffee.  In order to do so she needs to buy fertilizers and coffee seedlings.  \r\n\r\nHer hope is to see her children become independent and mature people.

This family lives in their own home in the indigenous community of Inchatingari in the district of Perene, in Chanchamayo province.\r\n\r\nBenito has worked ever since he was a child.

This way he gets extra income for his daily expenses.\r\n\r\nHe sells all of his products in the Pichanaki fruit market.  Buyers come to this market from various cities, and they pay a fair price for his harvested products.  \r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to renew some of his other crops, because some of his coffee fields are old and their production of beans is diminishing.  This loan that he hopes to get will be his 3rd from MFP.  As such, he gives his word that he will be punctual with his payments.

He's polygamous and has four spouses and six children. He lives with his four wives and children in M\u00e9dine, a working-class neighborhood in Sikasso.\r\n\r\nAfter trying several businesses without success, he became quickly familiar more than ten years ago with the business of stocking and selling sweet peas, shea nuts, and cereals.\r\n\r\nWith such experience in this field, he enjoys a strong reputation and receives lots of orders from outside the country. However, he lacks the necessary resources to meet this demand.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, he therefore decided to join Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, and benefited from four loans, which he repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nEager to better meet an ever-increasing customer demand, he's seeking this fifth loan to be able to buy 20 sacks of sweet peas, three tons of corn, 10 sacks of millet, and 10 sacks of shea nuts.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies in the villages surrounding Sikasso, and stock them in his store located at the new market in M\u00e9dine.

He is married to Alicia and they have four children: sixteen year old twins, and two youngsters, ages 15 and 12.  The family lives in the indigenous community of Inchatingari, district of Peren\u00e9, province de Chanchamayo.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been working since he was a child, and at a young age, he was already working on his parents\u2019 farm. In this way, he learned about agriculture, which is how he supports his family today.  \r\n\r\nHe has two coffee plots in production and a parcel of land that he has just cleared in order to plant small plants.  In addition, he grows citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons.  \u201cLast year, he harvested 40 sacks of coffee and sold them at a good price\u201d, he says.  When the work on the farms doesn\u2019t require added care, he works as a laborer on other farms.  In this way, he earns extra income for his daily expenses.  He sells all of his produce at the Pichanaki fruit market, where buyers come from various cities and pay him a fair price for his harvest.  \r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to acquire more land, which he must either purchase or lease.  Sales of coffee and achiote (a spice made from the red seed of the annatto tree) are more than profitable, and will enable him to achieve this goal.  This will be his third loan with MFP and he accepts responsibility for making his monthly payments on time.  His communal bank is called \u201cProductores Inchatingari\u201d, and he says that he feels comfortable with his companions because of the organized and orderly manner in which the group works.  \r\n\r\nHe will invest the funds in two thousand coffee plants and organic fertilizer to finish the parcel of land that he had cultivated a short time ago.  He will also pay day laborers, who will assist him with this chore.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1010174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase coffee plants and sacks of fertilizer, and to hire laborers.

61 years old.  She lives with her son's family and takes care of her grandson.  Zagipa worked for 36 years as an elementary school teacher, and she is now retired.  For a source of supplemental income for her family, in 1996 Zagipa started her own business in animal husbandry and farming.  \r\nThanks to her tenacity and perseverance, the business she started with 12,000 soum (KGS) now brings in about 8,000 soum per month from the sale of dairy and meat products.  Zagipa also cultivates 3.66 ha, where she grows potatoes, cereal crops, and sainfoin.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further development of her business, Zagipa turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 soum (KGS) for the purchase of cattle and seed for high-yield potatoes. Zagipa is planning to invest the income in further expansion of her farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1019997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock and potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chyrak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zagipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285514},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5021.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339115},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10042,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095461},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5021.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329709},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10042,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938471},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10042.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071010},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012201}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:23:38Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:58:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":394949,"name":"Candida Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a C\u00e1ndida es originaria de Estel\u00ed tiene 2 hijos de los cuales solo uno esta en la escuela, de oficio comerciante, se dedica a la venta de comida.
