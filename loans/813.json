She is married and the mother of six children.  She lives with her husband and children in Hamdallaye, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nRamatou has been buying and selling condiments for over thirty years.  She started this activity when she was very young, alongside her mother.  In order to better meet the needs of an increasing number of customers, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) taken with a women's association in Kadiolo Noumousso, she is now on to her fifth individual loan.  All her previous loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWith this current loan, she is planning to buy 15 boxes of tomato concentrate, 8 boxes of Maggi cubes, 5 bags of pepper grains, 4 bags of dried onions, 3 bags of laurel leaves and 8 boxes of mustard at the Grand Market in Sikasso.  She is planning to resell her merchandise for retail or wholesale, for cash or on credit, to customers who are consumers or retailers themselves. She will do so at the new market in M\u00e9dine where she is already reselling.\r\n\r\nWith her loan, Ramatou is expecting monthly profits to reach 120,000 CFA francs, which will be used to contribute to family expenses, pay off her loan's interest and invest the rest in her activity.  \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to become a wholesaler on the market where she currently works, in order to serve the retailers of that market who are often having a hard time accessing supplies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1019980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Rosa tells us that when she was in her third year of elementary school, her father made her a small wooden box which she filled with candies and then went out to sell them in every market in Pichari district so that she could cover some of her school expenses.

The couple have three children and live in their own home, in Llochegua district.  Wilmer has had to work hard to earn a living from a very young age.  When he was just 11 years old he started out in business, selling candies.  Every afternoon he sold his products in the street.  In this way, he managed to cover his school expenses as he didn't have enough support from his parents.  When Wilmer was in the fourth year of high school, he chose to form a family and stopped studying.  With a family to support, he had to work very hard to build up some capital.  As he was saving, he managed to set up a grocery store in order to make an income.  At first it wasn't so profitable but, over time, he became more well known and his business is now growing amazingly quickly.\r\n\r\nThis is Wilmer's second loan from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments on time.  He is happy to belong to his community bank because they are all supportive.  He will invest his 2,500 soles in increasing his stock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1012229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products to stock his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T12:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T12:10:10Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725.2,"local_amount":1908.42,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187718},{"amount":224.8,"local_amount":591.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":602.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573320}],"funded_date":"2012-03-29T08:58:30Z","paid_date":"2013-02-17T11:48:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":395836,"name":"Nasreen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasreen is forty-one years of age, married, and has a fifteen-year-old daughter who stays at home and helps her in doing household tasks.

She has been in this business for 12 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to go out very early as it is very dangerous.  She recalls that she started out in this business because her household income was low and this meant she was unable to provide her daughters with a good education.  However, since she started working, things improved a lot.  Over time, she hopes to be able to start selling new clothing which she will bring back from the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nThis will be Doris' seventh loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.

His wife works for a private company.  He has two children, ages eight and five, and they go to school.  He lives with his family in the Mario Quintanilla neighborhood in Choloma, Cortes.  \r\n\r\nRoger used to work as an operator in a factory.  However, he has had his own business of selling general merchandise for seven months.  He started this business with his own capital.  He set it up in his house in a place that he arranged in order to be able to sell his merchandise. \r\n\r\nHe says that there is a lot of pedestrian traffic in the area where he lives.  Therefore, his sales have grown.  He offers his customers a variety of sandals, second-hand clothes, underwear, and nick-knacks (toys, perfumes, and hair bands, etc.).

Mercedes runs a convenience store from her house, where she also sells cold drinks.

She remembers how, when she started, she didn't have any knowledge of how to do this kind of work, but with time she learnt and now she is an expert salesperson and very cherished among her customers. She enjoys her job because she gets to be around people so she isn't alone when her husband and son go out to work, and also because it generates a good income thanks to her good levels of daily sales.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mercedes' eighth loan from MFP, which she hopes to use to carry out her plans. For her part, she promises once again to keep up with her repayments, as she has with previous loans.

During her time in this job, she has learnt the importance of smiling all her customers, as this keeps them coming back and she is able to generate more sales and increase her income. She hopes with time to be able to remodel her home and put in a larger workshop and a Broaster fried chicken restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sobeida's fifth loan with MFP. Things are going very well with her group and she is happy to know that she has the financial support she needs to keep doing her work. She promises to carry on being a punctual and responsible member of the bank, as she has been up to now. With the loan of 1,000 soles she has requested, she will buy ingredients and products for her job, as well as some other materials and tools she needs to continue her work making items of clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1012932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials and sewing tools, as well as ingredients for making salchipapas (a Peruvian snack of hot dogs and fries).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sobeida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":158.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":164.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":165.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":180.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.94,"local_amount":311.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":313.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099799},{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":164.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":165.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713930},{"amount":62.2,"local_amount":165.86,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":166.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202826},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":177.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098495},{"amount":67.72,"local_amount":180.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":181.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401311}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T18:41:56Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":396147,"name":"Jose Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jose Encarnacion es soltero, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad,estudia en la universidad para prepararse mejor, se dedica al momento a la artesan\u00eda al tejido de cortes picos, inici\u00f3 como operario con sus padres y hasta el momento lleva 20 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de hilos de diferente clases y colores. ya que quiere mejora y tener un negocio grande.","en":"Jose Encarnacion is single, 20 years old, and studies at the university to prepare himself better.

This will improve the family's home living conditions.\r\n\r\nEyad is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She has a great desire to do well in life.  Cynthia is single and lives in her parents' home together with her two siblings Keyla and Vivi, who are 18 and 17 years old, as well as her mom and dad.  \r\n\r\nCynthia's business is selling groceries and she has a store in her parents' home where she serves her customers in a kind manner.  Her customers are mainly her neighbors and she has known how to gain their loyalty through the good service she provides.  Cynthia started her business one year ago with a loan from MFP and, up to now, she has worked alone though her sisters sometimes help her to serve her customers.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable as she sells basic household products which always sell well.  This gives her constant capital turnover.  She did not have any problems before starting out in her business but she wanted to make her own income and support her parents with their household expenses.  Given the good results that she has experienced, she would like to continue working in her business and also start a new business selling clothing as she has seen that this is pretty profitable too.\r\n\r\nThis will be Cynthia's fourth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have the support she needs to make progress in her business.  She feels comfortable with her community bank because of the support and solidarity that exists between its members.  Cynthia will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying groceries to stock her business so that she has a wide range of goods available for sale.  She will buy her products at low prices because she will be buying in bulk.  This will make her more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic household products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cynthia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":148.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":159.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.5,"local_amount":308.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":309.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099801},{"amount":62.04,"local_amount":165.43,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":166.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713932},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":166.6,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":167.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202828},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098497},{"amount":68.31,"local_amount":182.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":183.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401313}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T15:02:37Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":396002,"name":"Fanik's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fanik is 22 years old, a young Iraqi wife and mother of one child.

She is a single mother and has a 6-year-old son called Jockmer.  They live together in their own home which Susana bought together with her ex-partner before they separated.  \r\n\r\nSusana's business is selling meals, soft drinks, hamburgers and pies which she makes to her own recipe.  She prepares all her food in her mother's house as it is closer to her sales location.  She also provides lunches to workers on a construction site at a school which makes her 25 orders a day.  This gives her a regular, fixed income.  She started her business with a loan from her sister who also works in this trade and who encouraged her, showing her the profits that the business makes.  She started off preparing her food in small quantities, with a certain amount of trepidation at first, but when she saw how she was managing to sell all the food she prepared, she decided to keep going.  She says that she has been in some financial tight spots in the past as she is both mother and father to her son who needs food and an education.  Given this need, she looked for a trade that would make enough to support him.  Now that she is making good profits, Susana would like her business to thrive and, in the future, she would like to open another business (a stationery store) in her home.\r\n\r\nThis will be Susana's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels grateful to know that she will have financial support as this makes her feel more certain that she will achieve her goals.  She feels happy to be a member of her community bank as she believes it to be a united and supportive group.  Susana will use the 3,000 soles that she has requested to invest in buying a vehicle.  She will buy a second-hand motorcycle taxi (which costs 2,000 soles).  This will save her having to pay for transportation when she delivers her meals to her diners.  She will use the remaining money to buy ingredients for preparing her food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1013091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi and ingredients for preparing food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T16:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":449.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":478.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":476.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":514.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":546.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":348.17,"local_amount":928.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":933.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099802},{"amount":180.13,"local_amount":480.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":482.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713933},{"amount":193.78,"local_amount":516.76,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":519.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202829},{"amount":200.62,"local_amount":534.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":537.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098498},{"amount":202.3,"local_amount":539.43,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":542.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401314}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":395937,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is 33 years old and is the mother of 2 children.

Gisela lives with Horacio who is a salesman and the father of her two children, 12-year-old Chaline and 5-year-old Alison.  They live comfortably together in their own home which they worked very hard to buy.\r\n\r\nGisela's business is selling women's shoes that she buys through a catalog at affordable prices.  She also sells a range of clothing.  She sells the latest fashions for women, men and children and stocks up during her trips to the capital.  She sells all of her products from home to her friends, neighbors and family members.  She sells for cash and sometimes offers credit for up to 20 days.  She serves her customers in a kind and friendly manner which earns her their loyalty.\r\n\r\nGisela started her business five years ago with her own capital.  She got the idea from a friend who encouraged her to start selling.  Her sister helps her to attract new customers at her job, working for a public institution.\r\n\r\nGisela considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the money she makes and the demand that she has for her products.  She manages to sell all the clothing that she brings back from the capital.  Gisela did not have any problems before she started her business but she was really keen to make her own money and not depend solely on her partner's income.\r\n\r\nGiven the good results that she has experienced in her business, Gisela hopes to increase her stock of merchandise so that she can watch her business grow.  This will be her fourth loan from MFP.  She feels happy that she will have financial support in making progress in her business.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loans.  She says that she is happy with her community bank because it is a united and supportive group.  Gisela will use the 3,000 soles she has requested to buy fashionable women's shoes from her catalog so that she has stock available to sell.  This will allow her to grow her business.  She will buy at lower prices because she will be buying in bulk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1013123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gissela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":449.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":478.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":476.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":514.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":546.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":348.17,"local_amount":928.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":933.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099805},{"amount":178.83,"local_amount":476.88,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":479.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713936},{"amount":192.88,"local_amount":514.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":516.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202832},{"amount":200.08,"local_amount":533.53,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":536.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098501},{"amount":205.04,"local_amount":546.78,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":549.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401317}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T03:30:20Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":396006,"name":"Nasrin's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasrin is a 36-year-old Iraqi woman.

Together they live comfortably in their own home that they bought with much effort. Sarli's activity is selling chickens. To do this, she gets up very early every day and goes to where the the farmers from the surrounding towns go and she buys from them wholesale. Later she takes them to sell in the market where she sells them retail, generally selling everything she has in the morning. In the afternoon she sells snacks from a table in front of her house. Her customers are her own neighbors.  \r\n\r\nShe started this business more than a year ago with her own capital, and so far she does the work alone. She considers her business to be very profitable because it leaves her with good earnings and has helped her pay for her household expenses. She decided to start this business because before she didn't have her own income and her spouse' many times wasn't enough.

She is now acquiring the equipment she needs to re-start her business such as plates, pans, etc.  She will work alone.\r\n\r\nTeresa considers her business to be fairy profitable because of the demand she has.  She is very well-known in her area and her food is popular.  It was her neighbors who asked her to re-start her business.  Teresa says that she has financial problems because her partner's income isn't enough to cover all their expenses.  This is why she wants to support him with this additional income.  Given how profitable her business is and the orders she has, she would like to start again and continue working so that she can grow her business and, in the future, open a restaurant because she enjoys cooking.\r\n\r\nThis will be Teresa's fifth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support in carrying out her plans.  She pledges to be responsible in making her loan repayments as she was with her previous loans.  She says that she is very happy to belong to her community bank because of the support that they give to people through access to loans.  Teresa will invest the 1,500 soles she has requested in buying equipment for her business such as pans, glasses and plates.  She will also buy tables, chairs, and ingredients she needs for preparing her meals.

She has a great will to advance. She lives with her partner, Elvis, who is a laborer and the father of their three children, Liza, who is 18, Elvis, who is 14, and Brenda, who is 5. Together they live comfortably in their own house, which they bought with great effort.\r\n\r\nGriselda's business is selling beauty products such as nail polish, lipstick, lotions, and other items. She also sells a variety of clothing for women, men, and children, items in different styles and that are in fashion. She acquires all these products through catalogs and she sells them from her house to her friends, relatives, and neighbors, whom she serves in a kind and cordial manner, winning their business. Thus they recommend her to other people, who in time become regular customers.\r\n\r\nShe began this business more than four years ago, with a little capital of her own, and so far her sister and her daughter have helped her obtain new customers. She considers her business fairly profitable because of the earnings it provides her, along with the opportunity to be a prosperous businesswoman.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning her business, she had financial problems, since she was not practicing her profession of teaching, and she needed an income to continue paying for the education of their children, since her partner's income was only sufficient for food. Now, seeing her good results, she has plans to continue and with her earnings invest in arranging their house to refurbish rooms to rent, looking to generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support to advance with her business. For this, she assures that she will be punctual in making her payments to have a good credit record and have access to more loans in the future. In addition, she comments that she feels comfortable in her communal bank because she considers all the members to be good and united people. With the 2000 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise such as clothing of various styles for all genders, since she has orders to fill. She will also buy more beauty products to have a stock on hand for sale, in both cases seeking lower prices by making her purchases for cash and in volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more cosmetics and clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":299.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":319.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":317.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":342.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":365.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":232.02,"local_amount":618.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":621.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099811},{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":317.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":319.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713942},{"amount":128.53,"local_amount":342.76,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":344.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202838},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":355.54,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":357.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098507},{"amount":136.95,"local_amount":365.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":367.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401323}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T22:10:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":396466,"name":"S\u00e9n","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S\u00e9n is 20 years old.

She lives with her partner, Daniel, who is independent and the father of her four children, two of whom are on their own.  They live together in their own home with their two children who are 19 and 17 and whom they love very much.  Marja sells different brands and flavors of carbonated drinks for a living.  For this business, she has a refrigerator in her house where she keeps her products ice cold like her customers like them because it is so hot where she lives.  She serves her customers from there very courteously.\r\n\r\nShe also has a mototaxi that she rents out to earn extra income.\r\n\r\nShe started both businesses over seven years ago, then used her earnings to set up her house to sell drinks by putting in tables and chairs for her customers' comfort.  So far she has done all of this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe thinks her business is pretty profitable because of the earnings she has made and because of the demand for her products.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start her business because she wanted to be able to have her own income to count on to help her partner with the household expenses.  She thought that it would allow them to make progress more quickly.\r\n\r\nAs such, seeing the results of her businesses, she wants to continue and increase her stock in her products in order to see her business grow.  This will be her eighth loan with MFP.  She is thankful and happy to know that she can continue to count on their financial support to move ahead with her business.  She is also happy with her communal bank because she knows the other members and she considers them to be responsible people.  With the requested sum of 1,000 nuevos soles, she will buy merchandise in greater volume and look for better prices for her purchases, which will allow her to earn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a greater variety of soft drinks\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":148.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":159.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.5,"local_amount":308.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":309.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099812},{"amount":62.04,"local_amount":165.43,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":166.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713943},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":166.6,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202839},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098508},{"amount":68.31,"local_amount":182.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":183.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401324}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T17:45:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":396018,"name":"Mhabat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhabat is a 52 year woman from Iraq.

She is separated and she sews for a living.  She is the mother of three children who are 18, 15, and 10 years old.  She lives in her own home, which she was able to build through a lot of hard work.  Piedad sews, making clothing for men, women, and children for all occasions: graduations, fifteenth birthday parties, school clothes, and more.  She makes everything in her own home in an area well equipped with sewing machines and furniture where she attends her customers very courteously.  She works for a private company half-time and in the afternoons she sews.  She started in this business because she learned sewing from watching her mother and realized that it is profitable.  When she started, she only had one machine that she bought with and MFP loan, but now she's well set up.  She does this business with a friend.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she considers her business to be profitable because she makes a good income that allows her to offer her children a better education and a good level of comfort.  It also allows her to cover her household expenses as she is both mother and father to her children.  Before starting this business her income didn't cover everything.  She hopes to keep growing, to buy new machines, and to expand her business.  This will be her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to be able to count on the financial support she has received.  Because of it, she will make progress with her business and she will become a great businesswoman.  She also tells us that she is very happy to be part of a responsible group.  With the requested loan for 1,500 nuevos soles, she will buy sewing materials, such as fabrics and elastic, among other things, to use in her business and to complete the orders she has pending.  She will get all of these materials in the capital in order to look for better prices for her bulk purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, elastic, zippers, and other sewing materials\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Piedad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.14,"local_amount":467.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":480.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099813},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":244.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713944},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":263.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202840},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":273.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098509},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":279.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401325}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T14:57:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":396558,"name":"Huda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huda is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\nHuda is a 35 year old woman who is a mother with five sons and one daughter.

This will be her 10th loan with the MFP institution.  She comments that she is grateful for the opportunity to be able to access a line of credit to realize her plans.  As such, she is committed to making her payments, as she has done in the previous loans she has taken.  This way she can sustain a good credit rating and access more loans in the future.  Also, she comments that she is very comfortable working in her communal bank because of the support that they provide to people.  With the sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles requested, she will invest in all types of merchandise, such as clothing in a variety of sizes and styles for women, men and children.  She will also buy women's shoes.  She will buy all of this merchandise in bulk, seeking out the lowest prices for her purchases so that she can have greater profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.14,"local_amount":467.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":480.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099817},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":244.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713948},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":263.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202844},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":273.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098513},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":279.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401329}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T04:58:20Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":396254,"name":"Emiliano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\tEl se\u00f1or Emiliano, es agricultor de zona de la concepcion, junto a su familia, los planes hacia un futuro es poder mejorar las condicones de vida, don Emiliano agradece el apoyo que le brinda afodenic atravez  de los fondos Kiva, ya que gracias a los financimientos a obtenidos mejores resultados y a la vez con el poco dinero que le quedaba de ganancia logro preparar a unas de sus hijas que ahora es enfermera.Espera en Dios que le sigan apoyando y si tener algun dia una mejor condicion de vida con todo su familia .El necesita el financimiento para la compra defertilizantes e insumos para aplicar fetilizantes e insumos a una manzana de caf\u00e9 .","en":"Emiliano, a farmer from the Concepcion zone, together with his family, has plans for a better future, hoping to improve his family's standard of living.

She starts at daybreak, by going to the fish market to buy directly from the fishermen. Later, she takes the fish to her own fish stand in the Bellavista market, where she prepares them for sale. She gives her customers very good service, knowing that in this way, they will keep buying from her in the future. \r\n\r\nShe began more than four years ago with her own capital, seeing that it would be easy to start and that there was enough demand. Seeing the rotation and increasing her capital each day, because she generally sells what she brings to the market and up til now, her oldest daughters occasionally help her in the market. Before she started her business, she had economic problems because she had separated from the father of her children and needed to have an income because the pension she received for her children was not enough, so she decided to start selling fish.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results she has had, she hopes to grow her business and increase her capital. This is will be her seventh loan with MFP. She is grateful to know that she can count on the financial support to advance her business plans. On the other hand, she feels comfortable with her communal bank and she considers it a unified and supportive group. The loan requested is 3,000 nuevos soles and she will invest it in the purchase of wholesale fresh fish and will seek it for lower prices. Furthermore, she would like to arrange her house to be able to open another business, a grocery store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1013203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy more fresh fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzdina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":456.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":477.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":475.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":513.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":532.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":544.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350.35,"local_amount":934.27,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":938.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099818},{"amount":178.45,"local_amount":475.86,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":478.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713949},{"amount":192.47,"local_amount":513.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":515.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202845},{"amount":199.64,"local_amount":532.39,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":535.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098514},{"amount":204.09,"local_amount":544.23,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":546.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401330}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T20:59:34Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Burns","image":972677}},{"id":397613,"name":"3.9.131.thi\u1ec7u D\u01b0\u01a1ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. \u0110i\u1ec7p D\u01b0\u01a1ng operates a food stall\/restaurant selling fruit.

She is married to Ronald, who is employed and the father of their 3 children who are 18, 12, and 2 years old.  They live comfortably together in their own home.  Amparo works in the sales of fast foods like broasted chicken, fried wings, \"salchipapas\" [fried hot dogs and french fries], and other things.  She sets up her cart every night in front of her house along with two tables with their chairs, where she attends very nicely to her customers, making their orders.  She has more than 6 years of experience in this business, counting on her eldest daughter's support in serving the customers.  She likes her business because of the economic income.  Furthermore, she likes the kitchen, and having the ability to support her husband with the household costs.  She thinks that her business is fairly profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.  As such, she has plans to continue with her business and to begin selling grilled chicken, opening a rented location.  This will be her 11th loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore, she expects their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans.  Besides, she mentions feeling pleased with her communal bank because of the support that they receive to advance with their business.  With the amount requested of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of ingredients to prepare the fast food such as oil, flour, chicken, and other items,  looking for the lowest prices for her cash purchases."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1008569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy oils, flour, and chicken meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.03,"local_amount":309.41,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":311.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099712},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":159.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713847},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202740},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":178.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098419},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401211}],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T00:39:11Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Dupre","image":170204}},{"id":396370,"name":"Ruqaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruqaya is a conservative person so she has asked her brother Mohammad to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nRuqaya is 30 years old and single.

They live together in their own home, which they purchased after lots of effort. Floripes sells women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s clothing which her cousin sends from Lima for the different festivals. She also has a beauty salon where she offers services such as hair-cutting and dyeing, among others. She learned these skills by studying at an occupational education center. She is attentive in both sales and customer service, which earns her repeat customers. She has spent more than two years working in these businesses, and up until now has been working by herself.\r\nShe likes her business because of the economic return it provides her, the benefit of having a trade, and the feeling it gives her of being a productive person. She hopes to be able to spend more time at home to take care of her children and also to be a prosperous businesswoman. She considers her business to be reasonably profitable due to the demand for it and the good profits it provides her. As a result, she has plans to expand her beauty salon and convert it into a health spa, offering other services. This will be her third loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma], and she is looking forward to working with MFP to be able to realize her plans. Additionally, she feels good about her communal bank due to the support which it continues to offer folks, providing them with an opportunity to benefit from a line of credit.

He is also kind and friendly, and has a great desire to do well in life.  He lives together with Mika who is a housewife and supports him in his agricultural work.  The couple have three children who are 17, 16 and 15 years old.  They work hard to provide them with a better quality of life.  The family live comfortably together in their own home.\r\n\r\nJuan's business is farming.  He has 60 hectares of farmland but only has 10 hectares sown with corn.  The corn is ready to be harvested and he already has buyers for it.  Juan started his business ten years ago with his own capital and the help of his partner.  They started sowing small quantities of crops but then expanded and increased their capacity owing to the demand they had for their produce.  Juan considers his business to be fairly profitable because his produce is in demand and he makes good profits, especially during periods when there is a shortage of corn.\r\n\r\nJuan started out in this business because he needed a trade and an income with which to support his family and provide them with a better quality of life.  Given the good results that he has had, he plans to expand his sowing capacity to 20 hectares as he has quite a lot of demand that he can't meet with his current production.  This will make him more profits and he will grow his business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juan's third loan from MFP.  He feels happy that he will have financial support in making progress with his plans.  For this reason, he pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He says that he feels happy with his community bank as he considers the members to be good people.  Juan will invest the 2,000 soles he has requested in paying laborers to harvest his corn and get it ready to deliver to his buyer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2010,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401335}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:22Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":397797,"name":"Hai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hai, 54, is married and lives with her husband and son in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia.

Also she can offer work to others when harvest time comes.\r\nShe states that she started the business  because she wanted to be an entrepreneur and have her own earnings and not depend on her partner\u2019s income.  She had good results and now plans on continuing the business and expanding the crops to 8 hectares.  That way she will generate more earnings and cover other markets.  This is her 4th loan with MFP and she feels happy that she will have its financial support with her plans.  She promises to be punctual with her payments as she has been with the previous loans.  She also says that she feels content with the communal bank since she knows most of the members and considers them to be responsible and helpful people.

She is willing to go to a lot of trouble to obtain a better future for herself. She is energetically pursuing whatever needs to be done to achieve her objectives.\r\n\r\nLourdes works in the fields growing cocoa, a product that brings in a good income in the Palmapampa area. At harvest time she hires labourers to help her pick the cocoa quickly. The rainy season poses a problem as she cannot look after the fields as well as she would like; spreading insecticide and weeding between the plants are difficult to do then. Sometimes she cannot afford the supplies necessary to avoid a bad harvest. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Lourdes has approached MFP for help with her problems. This will be her second loan with MFP. She promises to make the repayments punctually. She is a responsible member of her community bank. With the S\/.1000 loan Lourdes will contract labourers to help her weed the afflicted plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire labourers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T01:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T01:30:07Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.13,"local_amount":173.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":174.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099823},{"amount":33.98,"local_amount":90.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713954},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":94.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":95.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202849},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":97.38,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098519},{"amount":38.1,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":102.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401341},{"amount":39.04,"local_amount":104.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455644},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":108.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":109.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451391},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":112.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":113.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446572},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":116.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":116.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052605}],"funded_date":"2012-03-07T12:02:09Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":397842,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John, 39 years old, is a mixed crop farmer.

As a result of much care and dedication he now has his own small farm. During harvest times he has the support of hired workers, which allows him to pick the beans quickly so that later he can take them to warehouses located in San Francisco to sell them. It is difficult for him to transport his product from his land to the businesses where he sells. For now his highest priority is to increase his production. This will be his 5th loan with MFP, with which he promises to make his payments on time. He is thankful for the trust that his communal bank group has provided. With the 1.000 Nuevos Soles he will buy chemical fertilizers to maintain his crops in good care. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chemical fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1005,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455649}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:36:47Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Kell","image":809712}},{"id":397876,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa is 40 years old and lives in Compound #3.

She also has a mototaxi which she rents to her neighbor.  She has a space set aside in her home where she stores her bicycles and where Miguel provides maintenance to them.  She started her business over six years ago with one bicycle.  After noticing a demand for her services, she decided to invest in the purchase of additional bikes.  One bicycle was stolen along the way, but she was able to obtain nine bicycles.  Through wear-and-tear, only three bikes are currently in working condition and the remaining six are being repaired.  Pilar\u2019s partner and children help her to tend to the business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable due to the earnings she receives, as there is a demand for her services.  Prior to starting her business, she had financial troubles because her partner\u2019s income was not sufficient to cover the household expenses.  However, she can now help him and she hopes to have a better quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her earnings, she hopes to save in order to buy another mototaxi and rent it out to increase her income.  This will be her third loan with MFP and she is grateful for the financial support to help her business grow.  In addition, she says that she likes her communal bank, as she has come to know her fellow members and considers them to be friendly and responsible.  She will invest the 1,200 PEN (Peruvian Nuevos Soles) requested toward the purchase of a 5,000 PEN mototaxi in order to increase her income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1013832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase another mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T02:20:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":179.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":191.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":190.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":205.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":218.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.48,"local_amount":179.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":180.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099828},{"amount":71.82,"local_amount":191.53,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":192.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713958},{"amount":71.55,"local_amount":190.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":191.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202854},{"amount":77.17,"local_amount":205.79,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":206.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098524},{"amount":80.05,"local_amount":213.46,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":214.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401346},{"amount":81.93,"local_amount":218.48,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":219.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455650}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T13:31:15Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":397883,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a 36-year-old single mother of four children aged sixteen, eleven, seven and four years old.

They live in their own home together with one of their sons, Ricardo, who is 24 years old.\r\n\r\nThe work that Gloria does is selling ceviche, which is a traditional dish in Peruvian cuisine.  She sells from premises that are located in her home, which saves her paying rent.  She tells that she began this business when her daughter came into some capital over three years ago.  Her daughter had the idea to begin this business, so they partnered together and began selling only on the weekends.  They sold to neighbors and also went door-to-door looking to find customers.  Later on, they set up a space in their home with tables and chairs to serve their new customers comfortably.  They have now increased the days on which they sell, and have two people helping with serving whom they pay weekly.  Her daughter is in charge of preparing the ceviche.  Gloria considers her business to be quite profitable, as it provides good earnings and they have been able to gain a regular clientele.  She comments that she began this work due to the necessity of having additional income, and to support her daughter in making the business a reality.  She saw that is was a good idea for them to venture into this, earning good results thanks to their efforts.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to expand her business with more tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers.  This will be her third loan with the MFP lending institution.  She is grateful to know that she can count on a line of credit to make her plans reality.  On the other hand, she says that she enjoys being part of her communal bank, as she considers them to be a united and responsible group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested sum of 1,000 new soles, she will invest in the purchase of cooking utensils such as plates and glasses, and also in furniture such as tables and chairs.

They live in her parents' home, together with her dad an mom, who help her look after her children.\r\n\r\nGiulliana's business is selling food such as juanes (a traditional dish from the Peruvian jungle similar to a tamale), grilled chicken, snacks and other things.  Every afternoon she sets up her table in front of her parents' houses and offers all her prepared dishes for sale.  She also sells refreshments.  She serves her customers, most of whom are her neighbors, in a very friendly manner, and they recommend her to other people who over time become regular customers themselves.\r\n\r\nShe started this business over five years ago with a specific loan, purchasing and selling in small quantities so that she could later grow in line with demand for her dishes. Up until now, she has been doing all this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be quite profitable because of the earnings that it provides, and and because she almost always sells everything that she prepares.  She also tells us that she enjoys her business, as she knows how to cook.  She decided to begin the business out of the need to have her own income and have a trade, as she wasn't able to cover expenses for her children and she was having financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nSeeing her good results, she now wants to expand and open a grocery store in her parents' home.  This will be her third loan with the MFP lending institution.  She is happy to know that she will be able to have access to a line of credit in order to continue with her plans.  She also comments that she enjoys being part of her communal bank, as she knows all the members, and considers them to be her friends and to be responsible people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1,000 new soles, she will invest in purchasing general groceries.

Because of this, each year he takes great pains to care for his plants, so that common plant diseases such as coffee-leaf rot and rooster's eye do not ruin the leaves and coffee beans.\r\nSowing annatto seed is also profitable, because the demand for this product exists year-round.  Buyers use this fruit for the production of condiments and natural dyes.\r\nVictor and Furora live in harmony working together in the fields.  They have few worries, but they want to continue working because they like to live surrounded by plants and fresh air.\r\nThis will be this 3rd loan at the MFP, thanks to their support.

She considers her business fairly profitable, since in these areas she manages to sell at higher prices and has higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nBefore she began her business, she had financial problems, since her partner's income was not sufficient and her family was growing.

Rosa has made a living for the past five years selling groceries out of a tiny storefront that she and her husband run out of their home.

For that reason, she wants to invest more in these kinds of products like crayons, markers, stationery, and other items. The other member of the group is Gregoria, who for a number of years has made a living selling all kinds of things to support her husband and their four children.

She is separated from the father of her son Fabricio, who is 3 years old. She lives in her father's house with her son, her mother, and her father, who help her to raise her son. Ibethsi's business is selling food such as juanes (a stuffed dish similar to a tamal, containing rice, spices, and meat, fish or yucca), noodles, and other items in the mornings. To do this she has a stall in the market near her home where she serves her customers in a friendly and cordial manner, winning their business.\r\n\r\nShe began more than 10 years ago, using her own capital and preparing in small quantities. Seeing the reception that her business had, she decided to continue, and so far she has had help from her mother in preparing the food and serving customers, and she shares her earnings with her. She feels that her business is fairly profitable because she almost always sells everything she prepares, giving her good earnings. She decided to begin this business because of the need to have a job and an income to cover her expenses and those of her son, since she is separated from her partner.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results she is having with her business, she has plans to continue it and make it grow. This will be her fifth loan with MFP. She is happy to know that she will have access to financial support to make her plans a reality. In addition, she comments that she feels comfortable with her community bank because she knows the majority of its members and considers them to be friendly and responsible people.\r\n\r\nWith the 2000 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of cooking utensils such as pots, plates, glasses, and other items to renew what she has and thus offer better service to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pots, plates, and glasses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibethsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":299.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":319.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":317.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":342.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":365.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":299.7,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":301.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099829},{"amount":119.63,"local_amount":319.02,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":320.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713959},{"amount":119.17,"local_amount":317.78,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":319.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202855},{"amount":131.01,"local_amount":349.36,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":351.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098525},{"amount":130.85,"local_amount":348.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":350.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401347},{"amount":136.95,"local_amount":365.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":367.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455651}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T19:18:13Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":397946,"name":"Vitalis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vitalis is 46 years old and married to Naomi, who runs a retail shop.

Her husband is employed, buy gets a low salary that is not enough to cover the family's expenses.\n\nGhazaleh is requesting a youth loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her son and living room seats. This will offer her family better and more suitable home furniture and will let them live in better conditions.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Marwan wants to expand his project by purchasing an additional number of sheep. He is requesting a youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs as he has gained a respected number of customers. This expansion will increase sales and improve the family's income.\n\nMarwan is photographed in his project.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She lives with her partner and the couple have a 1-year-old son.  Every day, Sandra works hard as she would like to provide her son with a better quality of life and improve her family's financial situation.  She lives in her own home together with her partner and son.\r\n\r\nSandra's business is selling clothing.  If anybody on her block needs to buy any clothing to attend a social or family event, they always seek her out because she has suitable garments for any occasion.  She has a small space in her house which she set up to serve her customers in.  Sandra has been in this business for two years now and works alone as she feels more comfortable that way.  She enjoys her business because it makes her income and also allows her to care for her son.  At the same time, it makes her feel very useful as she is contributing financially towards her household.  In common with all determined and entrepreneurial women, Sandra has many plans for the future.  She would like to have a store where she can offer the different clothing that she sells in more comfort and with better access to the public.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sandra's second loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time, as she did with her previous loans.  She enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.
