He has a mill (\"tahoun\") and has been involved in purchasing grains then selling them to his customers after milling. He started his business because it has fast sales in the market and is attractive to business partners. He works at the business from 7:00 am until 7:30 pm, 7 days per week. He is an incredibly hard-working man and as a result has a lot of experience. In addition, it is the only main source of his income. On the other hand, through lots of effort, he has managed to grind his customer`s grain, i.e., he provides them a service to put food on the table. Recently, he says that the main challenge to his business is a seasonal problem: during the dry season this type of product is very expensive.\r\n\r\nSo, Mohammed took out a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase grain for his business. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to improve his standard of living. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to expand his business to have a extra mill store because his region is lacking some services which he could supply to solve people's needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1016428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase grain for his milling business so as to improve his standard of living.

She takes all of her harvest on trucks that she hires for their transport.  Buyers from coffee cooperatives and from other cities come to the wholesale market.  They do not hesitate to pay a fair price for her entire production.  Sadith turns the money around and invests in more crops.

one son and two daughters.  Olmakhon has been involved in animal husbandry for 15 years, after starting this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, today her business has two horses, twelve cows, five calves, twenty sheep and ten goats, and yields about 8,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.

children, the youngest of whom, a daughter, is a first grader.  Turdugul has been involved in animal husbandry for 15 years, after starting this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).

Her greatest wish is for her children to receive a good education.\r\n\r\nFor 24 years, Lucila has been selling construction supplies such as iron, cement, paint, nails, wires and other materials.  Her business gives her a lot of opportunities to get ahead in life and cover her household expenses.  However, she experiences some difficulties when her customers request materials that run out quickly.  Lucila found out about MFP's loans and saw that they would be very useful for her business and would mean she wouldn't lack any building tools.\r\n\r\nThis will be Lucila's 17th loan from MFP and she is ready to make her repayments in a punctual manner.  She is a very cheerful member of her community bank who abides by the agreements that they reach.  She will use her 1,000 soles to buy construction supplies that she is lacking so that she can increase the stock of her hardware store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1011159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.13,"local_amount":173.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":174.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099776},{"amount":33.98,"local_amount":90.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":91.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713907},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":94.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202803},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":97.38,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":97.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098472},{"amount":38.1,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":102.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401288},{"amount":39.04,"local_amount":104.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":104.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455599},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":108.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":109.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451371},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":112.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":113.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446551},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":116.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":116.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052587}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T18:01:11Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":398547,"name":"Ustawi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asteria, who is in her mid 30s, is married with three children, two of whom go to school and the last one is still young.

She is married to Jorge, who is a merchant and father of their three children: Jorge, 18; Jaky, 6; and Pablo, 5. They live together in their own home that they bought with a lot of hard work and collaboration. Luz makes a living making and selling brooms out of a small workshop in her home. She has two machines to cut the sticks and bristles, and then she assembles them to ensure a good product. All of her products are sold wholesale to nearby merchants, where she has delivery orders thanks to the good service she provides. She started more than 18 years old with her own money and the support of her husband, who helps her in making and selling the brooms. Sometimes her eldest son helps out as well. She considers the business to be quite lucrative due to the profits she generates and the regular customer base that buys up everything she produces. Before starting the business she had some financial problems because she didn't have a trade or regular income, making the household finances difficult. She didn't want to see her children to suffer, so she decided to work. Now she sees the good results from her job, and she wants to continue because it is her only source of income.

She began this business more than 5 years ago with some capital of her own, thanks to the initiative of her sister, who encouraged her, seeing the needs she suffered, and so far she has been working alone. She considers her business fairly profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her, and because she manages to sell all the merchandise that she offers.\n\nBefore beginning her business she suffered many difficulties because of the scarcity of work. In addition, she liked business and looked for a way to generate her own income to help her partner with the household expenses.

She lives with Roy, who is employed and the father of her only daughter, 3 years old, for whom they work to get ahead. They live comfortably in their own house that they built with much dedication and hard work.\n\nReyna\u2019s business is the sale of sugar cane juice, which she does from a small stall at the market. She also has a mill that helps her in her business. Every day she gets up very early and shops for ingredients such as sugar cane to take to her stall where she presses and sells it with ice so that it is a pleasant temperature for her customers. She started her business more than 3 months ago and notes that she used to plant several hectares in sugar cane and the production would be sold to a single buyer, but the buyer's business failed and she was left with a cane harvest without being able to sell it. Seeing this problem, she had the idea of selling it as juice so as not to lose her harvest. Now, seeing the good returns she earns and the profits she makes, she plans to continue in her business.\n\nThere is more. She wants to buy a cargo transport unit with her profits in order to transport the sugar cane and return to planting several more hectares in order to supply her own juice business.  This will be her first loan with MFP. She is pleased to know that she will be able to rely on a line of credit to continue with her business. Consequently, she says she will be responsible in making her payments so that she will have a good credit history and access to more loans in the future.

Gracias a que su terreno se encuentra en muy buenas condiciones para tener un cultivo, Jose ha sembrado algunas verduras y legumbres en \u00e9l, y adem\u00e1s Jose aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de semillas y abonos para aumentar su cultivo en su terreno y poder generar mayores ingresos para el sostenimiento de su familia. \n\nJose espera que de esta manera su esposa y sus 5 hijos puedan acceder a una mejor calidad de vida y en un futuro poder brindarles a sus hijos el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n superior. Jose sue\u00f1a con tener una gran comercializadora de legumbres donde pueda generar mucho empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas de su regi\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Jose is a very hard worker who early on had to leave school and engage in farm work due to family problems. Jose started by working for a family on their farm, where Jose planted crops on the land belonging to the farm. He was thus able to generate income for his household and at the same time learn to improve the quality of his work.\r\n\r\nBecause he is well organized financially, Jose was eventually able to buy a house with some land where he lives with his family. Jose is married and the father of five children, for whom he always wanted to provide a good quality of living. Because his property is well suited to planting crops, Jose has planted some greens and vegetables on it.\r\n\r\nJose hopes that a loan will give him the opportunity to purchase seeds and fertilizers. This will increase crop yield in his field and generate more revenue for the upkeeping of his family.\r\n\r\nJose hopes this way to provide his wife and five children with a better quality of living, and in the future to be able to give his children access to higher education. Jose dreams of operating a large vegetable market where he can create many jobs for people in need in his region.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Marino works as a farmer growing coffee plants. He has developed his knowledge of agriculture over 45 years, and he is known throughout his neighbourhood for his expertise. For that reason, his neighbours come to Marino to ask for help with their own work. He feels very committed to his work; it is thanks to that and to the hard work he puts in every day that his plants are now very productive, and he is therefore able to earn a good income.\r\n\r\nThe loan Marino has asked for is to buy coffee plants for grafting, so he can enjoy the fruits of his labour in less time.

The group consists of three women and three men, all hardworking. Every one of the group members is married and has a family, and every one of them works makes an effort day by day to get ahead. Some sell shoes by mail order, buy raw materials to make embroidery, buy plastic for greenhouses, buy carpentry materials. In summary all of them have activities geared around commerce, and they do them with the goal of making a profit. When they can they help with household expenses and contribute to school costs for the children or with the household pantry. Also, because they don't have fixed employment with salaries and want to invest some of their time in something productive and support their partners, so that they can continue on with all the necessities that they have now, it's worth mentioning that the people of this group are very responsible and hard working, very friendly and conscious of their responsibility in requesting a loan. This undertaking to improve their lives appeals to them. \n\nThe San Pablo community is an area with a lot of vegetation. Furthermore it has a very large reservoir which supplies the necessities of the community in large measure. In San Pablo they count on services like water, clinics, schools, and continuous transport to town. Beyond all that it is a well settled area, and to top it off a beautiful community. \n\nThe group decided to call itself \"Aurora\" because this is the name of one of the people who organized the group. It was the decision of all the group members that it would be a good name to remember that Se\u00f1ora Aurora took on new things that would benefit everyone. This is the second time the group has asked for a loan, however, Aurora decided this time not to ask for a loan, and that is why her name is not among the list of participants.\n\nThe names of the six members are: \n1. Ver\u00f3nica is 29 years old and is asking for this loan to buy men's and women's shoes to sell. \n2. Gilberta is 52 years old and is requesting the loan to buy fabric, thread, yarn and lace to make and sell embroidery. \n3. Librado is 47 years old and requests his loan to buy plastic for a greenhouse for cacti. \n4. J. Felix is 46 years old and is requesting a loan to make fried food. \n5. Tom\u00e1s is 42 years old and is asking for the loan to buy wood for use in his carpentry shop. \n6. Ma. del Carmen is 49 years old and she is asking for the loan to buy cloth, thread, lace and painted napkins to make embroidery for sale. \n\nLibrado is the representative of the group. He is 47 years old and finished elementary school. In his free time he does bricklaying, plumbing and electrical jobs. He has been married for 24 years to Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, who is a house wife. Together they have three children, the oldest of whom is 23 and married, and second oldest is 21, single and working, and the youngest of them is 20 years old and also works. Librado and his wife live in their own home - that is to say, they own it - and they do not pay rent. \n\nLibrado's motivation for joining this group is because he saw a motive to launch a business and so that the other group members, who also need money, can also participate in this undertaking. \"I am a very optimistic person. I like to help people and tell them that when they do their best, everything they want to do is always possible if they look for a way.\" Librado says, \"I do my work in the following way: when I receive money from my loan I am going to buy cactus stalks in town. The rest of the money I am going to invest in building a greenhouse which will be plastic and a supporting frame. Then when I've built my greenhouse I'm going to plant the cacti and fertilize them with cow and sheep dung, which works as a natural fertilizer. And once in a while I will have to water them because they need water, but very little. When they are grown I will cut them and I will take them to the market to distribute to businesses in town - to make back what I'm going to invest, I hope, and it will be well with me.\"\n\nLibrado says that until now he has not had any difficulty completing his jobs; he hasn't had any illnesses and in general things go well for him. \n\nLibrado has very concrete goals in mind. He would like to run his business on a large scale, build a big greenhouse and sell wholesale. He wants to fill his land with cacti and make this job his primary productive activity. \n\n\"It really motivates me that people that don't even know us have the kindness to support us in our businesses. Plus everything will go well for me because I've researched the conditions of the land where I live and if I can plant cacti, this investment will help me give a better life to my family and get daily sustenance,\" comments Librado. \n\nThe loan granted by the institution will be a big help so that this man can accomplish his goals and keep making progress. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1014099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacti and materials to buy a greenhouse.

He is a productive man who provides construction supplies to towns, such as iron, cement and wheelbarrows among other items, a business he has had for four years.\r\n\r\nOrlando does his job to further the work efforts engaged in by the towns of Valle Rio Apurimac, since the engineers in each of the towns come to Orlando because he is a person who responds promptly to their requests. There are also difficulties in obtaining the work tools they request. Consequently Orland has come to MFP to apply for a loan that will facilitate his work plans so that he can take punctual delivery of the materials that the cities are requesting. He also does not want to run afoul of his major clients. \r\n\r\nThis will be Orlando\u2019s second loan from MFP and he is committed to making his payments on time so that he can apply for another loan at a future time.

They have been very satisfied with the coffee and the bananas at the time of sale. Now they have planted passion fruit.  The plants are flowering, indicating that the fruit will be ready to harvest in the months of May and June.\r\n\u201cThe passion fruits sell well, which is why I decided to plant them.  Hopefully they will sell quickly.  Each \"java\" (basket) costs 30 soles\u201d, Martha says.\r\nThe work in the fields is tiring and demanding.  And so Martha has learned to arrange her time to complete her housework without neglecting her crops.  \r\nMartha's older children help her with the plants and the harvest.  She feels happy about her family's support.\r\nAfter assuring good results from her passion fruit plants, Martha will expand another plot with new plants.  She feels certain that it will go well.  Martha will be receiving her 8th loan from MFP, and so she promises to follow her re-payment plan responsibly.  She also takes pleasure in belonging to the communal bank \u201cFlor de San Juan\u201d (Flower of San Juan) because her companions are participatory and organized.  This time, Martha will use her loan to purchase 15,000 little coffee plants, which she will plant in 3 of the plots.  Each small plant will cost 30 cents.  With the rest of the money, she will purchase sacks of natural fertilizer.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1015029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 15,000 coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2545.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401383}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T19:28:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":399975,"name":"Murodchon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u044e\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0430. \u0417\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 6 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043c- \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438. \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 10000 \u0421\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.","en":"Murodchon is an active and hardworking young man.

This family lives in its own home in San Juan Autiki city center in Pichanaki District, Chanchamayo. \r\n\r\nDina is a farmer and plants her three parcels of land in coffee, plantains and bananas. Coffee production is economically profitable and she needs to cultivate her plantations all year.  Her crops are reflected in the money earned, which is enough to cover her daily expenses, reinvest in other plantings, and to set some aside in savings. The plantains are the key to her daily livelihood because she harvests them every week and the cassava are used primarily for her family\u2019s daily consumption. With the help of Eduardo and her grown sons she can optimize the work and make it more pleasant.\r\n\r\nDina and Eduardo also work as day laborers on the fields of others, thus earning a daily income. Also, when harvesting season comes she hires personnel to finish quickly. In this way the community engages in mutual support. She is happy to do this work, which enables her to maintain her household\u2019s stability.\r\n\r\nDina will receive her eighth loan from MFP, through your help.

She fattens her pigs, then kills them and sells them as 'suckling pig' (a traditional dish in her country).  Many people know Ysabel and they are always placing orders with her.  Her secret is the feed she gives to her animals.  As she has a restaurant it pays to prepare her food every day.  Ysabel would now like to start a business buying and selling animals.

She lives with her parents and 7 siblings, whom she looks after, in her own home, located in the town of Cajas. She is single, but she does not feel bad about it since she helps her siblings and is getting ahead in life, and \"that's the most important thing,\" she states. She studied Education in a well-known university, where she obtained the experience necessary to develop in her career. She is now working on a government education project in which she is the area supervisor. She oversees a literacy program for both the elderly and for adults who were not able to finish their studies. She likes this noble mission very much and is happy to help people get ahead.  Nevertheless, just like the rest of the locals, she also makes bricks for a living alongside her brother. They both make an average of 29 thousand, but she cannot work on brick making full-time, which is why she produces so few. However, she is now thinking about hiring workers who can produce even more bricks. She is a member of the Mi Banco Communal Bank, and this is her 17th loan with MFP.

She raised her son, Diofer, with whom she lives in her own home, located in the town of Cajas. She is very proud because her son is now a working professional. \"He helps me and is a very good person,\" she states. Thanks to her brick factory, she has been able to help her son get ahead since she has been doing this activity for 30 years. She states that with the help of laborers, whom she hires to help her out, she makes 25 thousand bricks a monthly, which she then transports to the local market by truck every week in the city's brick district. She earns good profits there, so much so that she now hopes to increase her monthly brick production. For this, she would like to hire more workers. What she likes most about her job is gathering firewood to burn the clay bricks that she makes. She states that it is fun because she walks in the countryside, her favorite place. She is a member of the Mi Banco Communal Bank, and this is her fourth loan with MFP.

He is 49, and lives with his wife, Olga, 48, and their 6 children in their own wood house.  In the Villavista area the peasants are very dedicted to their farming; one of these is Pedro who culivates coffee and a little cacao.  He has been doing this work for 34 years and it is easy for him since his parents taught him the skills when he was very young.  Now his children help him with the care of the plants by weeding and spraying to protect the crops from diseases.  During harvest time he hires farmhands to help him pick the fruit so that they finish quickly.  Afterwards he takes the fruit to sell in the collection centers in San Francisco where he is paid well per kilo.

She divides what she sells in two parts, one for her husband, which he sells going door to door, transporting it in a tray in his moto-taxi through the streets of the town. The other part she sells from their home, setting up a table in front of their house in the mornings where she attends to her customers with a very friendly manner.    \r\n\r\nShe started this business more than five years ago with her own capital, buying in small quantities, increasing as demand for her products increased. She considers her business to be very profitable based on the earnings she is left with and that she sells everything she has available. It is a food that is commonly eaten in the area.\r\n\r\nBefore she started her business she was struggling financially because their expenses increased after she had her second child. She had a desire to provide her children with a better quality of life and a good education so that they can reach their full potential. Also, she wanted to be able to help her husband pay for the household expenses. For these reasons and because of the good results she continues to have with her business, she wants to continue and start a new business venture selling clothes, to increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 3rd loan with the institution of MFP.

He is married to Miluska, who is a merchant and the mother of their four children. Together they live comfortably settled in their own home in the company of two of their children, Denis and Sarai, who are 19 and 9 years old, respectively. Javier's work is selling fresh fish, which he buys in the mornings at the local fishing port and sells as a street vendor, using a tricycle set up with a speaker to offer his products.

He feels that his business is reasonably profitable because of the earnings that it gives him, since he generally sells everything that he has to offer. He comments that he decided to begin his business out of the need to have a job, since he does not have a profession, and thus to have the necessary income to pay for his children's schooling, since managing to educate them is the best inheritance that he can leave them. In addition, seeing his daily earnings, he considers it more profitable than his last job as a mason.\r\n\r\nTherefore, seeing his good results, he wants to continue with his business to keep it going. This will be his third loan with MFP, so he hopes for your help to continue with his goals. In addition, he feels comfortable in his communal bank because he considers it a united and community-minded group. With the 1000 PEN that he has applied for, he will purchase fish in larger volume for his business, since with the scarcity prices are going up and he has to invest more capital. He wants to find slightly lower prices by making his purchases in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1015211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":151.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099866},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":160.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713995},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":159.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202892},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":171.22,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":172.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098562},{"amount":66.6,"local_amount":177.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":178.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401394},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":182.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455696}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:36:56Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":397334,"name":"Marlon Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marlon, es un humilde agricultor de la zona de Ticuantepe, soltero con muchas ganas de superarse, \u00e9l desde muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le ense\u00f1aron a cultivar las tierras, pero por problemas econ\u00f3micos no ha logrado sacar un buen cultivos, ya que hay que darle  un buen mantenimiento por ejemplo en el verano necesita aplicar exfoliante y refrescante para que la planta se mantenga con vida  .El pr\u00e9stamo lo va a invertir en fertilizantes e insumos necesarios para su debida inducci\u00f3n .","en":"Sr. Marlon is a humble farmer from the District of Ticuantepe.

Vive en su propia casa en compa\u00f1\u00eda de \u00faltimo hijo de 29 a\u00f1os y sus 02 nietos y sus hijos mayores ya son independientes. La actividad que realiza Juana es la venta de comidas como juanes, tamales, caldos de gallina y otros. Todos estos platos los prepara en su casa para luego venderlos de forma ambulatoria caminando por las calles de su vecindario. Se inicio con un capital de 10 nuevos soles vendiendo motes sancochados  que los ofrec\u00eda  de casa en casa, fue ahorrando sus ganancias y lo invirti\u00f3 en la preparaci\u00f3n de juanes , logrando la preferencia de sus clientes que la esperan a diario por la buena atenci\u00f3n que les brinda y hasta el momento lo realiza sola. Considera a su negocio rentable por las ganancias que le deja y la regular clientela que ha sabido ganarse con el pasar del tiempo.\nAntes de empezar su negocio, ten\u00eda problemas econ\u00f3micos, ya que se hab\u00eda separado del padre de sus hijos, y necesita un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para poder alimentarlos ya que con la pensi\u00f3n que les daba no les alcanzaba, tambi\u00e9n para tender un oficio y darles una mejor calidad de vida.

Por eso manifiesta ser\u00e1 responsable con el pago de las cuotas como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores. Adem\u00e1s comenta le gusta el trabajo de su banco comunal por la ayuda que brindan a las personas con el acceso a una l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito. Con el monto solicitado de 1500 nuevos soles, los juntar\u00e1 a un capital propio y los invertir\u00e1 en la compra un mototaxi de segundo uso valorizado en 2000 nuevos soles, para alquilarlo y  as\u00ed generarse m\u00e1s ingresos, como tambi\u00e9n ahorrarse gastos de transporte.\n\n","en":"Juana is 55, and is a friendly, good woman, besides being hard-working and enterprising, with a great desire to get ahead in life. She is separated from the father of her children, but he gives her alimony. She lives in her own home with her youngest son, 29, and her two grandchildren. Her adult sons are already independent.\r\n\r\nJuana sells meals such as juanes (rice and pieces of chicken wrapped in banana leaves), tamales, chicken soups and other dishes. She prepares all these dishes in her home, to later sell them as a street vendor, walking along the streets of her neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nShe got started with 10 nuevos soles of working capital, selling motes sancochados (individual grains of corn boiled with cilantro) which she sold door to door. She saved her earnings little by little and invested them in the preparation of juanes, winning the preference of her customers, who wait for her daily because of the good service she offers them. Up to now she works on her own. \r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the earnings it provides, and the regular clientele that over time, she has learned to win over. Before starting her business she had financial difficulties, as she had separated from the father of her children. She needed an income to be able to feed them, as the support her husband gave her wasn't enough; and also to help them them have a trade, and give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results, she has plans to continue with her business, and with the profits buy a transportation vehicle to rent out and generate more income for herself.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with the MFP institution. She feels happy to know that she will have a line of credit to move forward with her business. That is why she states that she will be responsible in making her installment payments, as with her previous loans. In addition, she says that she likes working with her communal bank, because of the help they offer people in accessing a line of credit.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles, together with her own capital, to invest in the purchase of a second-hand mototaxi valued at 2,000 nuevos soles. This is in order to rent it out and generate more income for herself, as well as save herself transportation expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":89.75,"local_amount":234.12,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":240.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401333},{"amount":485.25,"local_amount":1265.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1300.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456658}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T22:51:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":397425,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in beauty supplies for new services.

His monthly income is 200 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income in his family.

He is married and has two children.  Luis owns a tire repair shop.  He started working at the age of 12 and at 15 he started working for himself and set up his first workshop.  He also has a small kiosk inside his tire repair shop which his wife runs.  He plans to further expand his business so that he can provide his customers with a better service.  He is requesting this loan to buy soda, cookies, 'meneitos' (puffed corn snacks), gum and different types of candies.  This will help him to keep his kiosk better stocked and attract buyers.  He considers his business to be in a good location.  It is very busy as there are bus stops nearby.

In 2005, she finished high school but she did not continue through college because of financial constraints. She is single and recently she moved from her hometown of Lusaka to a nearby town, Chongwe, to start up her own mobile money business. She lives alone in a rented house not very far from where her shop is located. \r\n\r\nThe biggest business successes that Tina's business has achieved according to her is its early profitability which has allowed her to devote herself 100% to her own business, even though the profit margins are still small. She is hopeful that once she gets a Kiva loan she will be able to pay in full for her trading booth which she uses to serve her customers. She promises to make her payments on time. \r\n\r\nAfter experiencing some early business success, Tina is very excited to continue growing her business. She offers reliable money transfers to her new community and the difference in service and price can be seen immediately. According to Tina, before she started her business the people in her new community used unsafe and mostly expensive ways to move their money such as giving cash to a passing bus driver to deliver. She takes pride in the knowledge that her small business has made it possible for them to move money easily and safely. \r\n\r\nTina has many dreams for her future. At 25 years of age, she hopes to go back to school someday and study accounting. She also hopes to employ more people to help her at her shop as she currently only has one employee.

He runs his own local mobile money transfer business which he has been running for one year now. He describes his business as simply the sending and receiving of money electronically. Currently, Paul does not have enough working capital. He is not able to serve customers who want to send large amounts of money. This saddens him as he has to turn away customers and lose out on commissions. \r\n\r\nHe believes that his community benefits from his business because he offers them an easy and quick way of sending money and he works hard to give them the best customer service. \r\n\r\nHe has grown the number of transaction he does in a day. He has gone from only 10 transactions a day to an impressive 60. He has since managed to employ one person to help him in his shop. Paul describes his life as difficult; he is quick to say that he has not had it easy in life due to being orphaned at the young age of 10. He has not been able to pursue his education, but is grateful for the opportunity he has to run his own business and therefore gives it all he can. \r\n\r\nPaul's appeal to his lenders is that they help him raise the money so that he can let his customers send larger amounts of money. He has dreams of opening more mobile money outlets in his town. \r\n\r\nIn this video, Paul is interviewed by a representative from Mobile Transactions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4950,"image":{"id":1014648,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2551,"youtubeId":"YkdnC3aXemc","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Paul from  Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1014648},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To increase his working capital so that customers can send large amounts of money from his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":4950,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":4950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":492.36,"local_amount":2586125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2592020.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283208775},{"amount":500.83,"local_amount":2630625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2636622.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287634826},{"amount":509.68,"local_amount":2677125,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2683228.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480093},{"amount":587.62,"local_amount":3086500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3093536.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533503},{"amount":644.98,"local_amount":3387750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-30T08:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3395473.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308301565},{"amount":842.33,"local_amount":4424375,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4434461.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533403},{"amount":895.78,"local_amount":4705125,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4715851.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132505},{"amount":476.42,"local_amount":2502375,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2508079.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281399}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T22:30:39Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":9,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":397591,"name":"Domingo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Domingo vive en la comarca llamada  Potrillo ubicada en el municipio de Boaco, casado, tiene 3 hijos de los cuales solo el menor esta estudiando.

However, she only lives with two of them as her eldest left home to go and work outside the city.  They live in their own home in the small village of Cumutay, in Huasahuasi district.  Juana is an exemplary woman.  When the father of her children left her to bring them up on her own, she had to make a supreme effort to face her problems which were mainly financial.  \r\n\r\nJuana has been farming for 20 years.  She started out growing potatoes, peas and corn.  Over all these years, she has learned about the weather and the diseases that can affect her crops.  However, as she is intelligent, she knows how to deal with these problems.  Juana also raises two donkeys and some sheep and pigs.  In spite of all her responsibilities, she still has time to keep her home, her land and her pens clean.  She is certain that her work is profitable but it depends a lot on the care that she takes of her crops and how she sells them.\r\n\r\nJuana is a member of the 'Lindo Amanecer de Cumutay' community bank and this will be her tenth loan from MFP thanks to your help.

They all live together in their own home in the town of Pian, in Tarma district.\r\n\r\nJudith has been farming since she was 20 years old.  Thanks to the knowledge she gained from her parents as a child, she has been able to carry out her farming activities with skill.  She currently grows carrots, onions, gladioli and other flowers such as 'sarita' (small white flowers).  She also grinds grains and cereals such as peas, beans, corn, etc.  She has been in this new business for three years and it is going very well.  Judith comments that in order to grind her grains she bought a machine which makes the work easier.  \r\n\r\nJudith manages her time wisely so that she doesn't neglect either her crops or her business.  As if this weren't enough, she also runs a small grocery store which is located in her own home.  This is how she is able to ensure a good quality of life for her family and easily cover their basic needs.  She now hopes to acquire more land so that she can improve her vegetable production and stock her store with goods.\r\n\r\nThis will be Judith's 11th loan from MFP.  She gives her word that she will make her monthly repayments on time.  Judith is a member of the 'Sarita Colonia' community bank and she enjoys sharing activities with other responsible people like herself.  She will invest her money in two equal sums.  She will use half of her money to stock her store with groceries and the other half to buy dried grains such as corn, peas, beans, barley and wheat for preparing her ground food

He is married and has three children (ages 9, 5, and 2).  Carlos works very hard because he wants to protect his family and provide them a better quality of life.  He also takes care of his own home, which he was able to build thanks to a gift of land from his father.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarlos has a job that consists of transporting cargo and passengers within and outside of the city.  When passengers want to reach their destination safe and sound, Carlos offers them a ride.  One of his virtues is that he is very careful.  He has the necessary experience for transporting potential passengers and dealing with any difficulties.  Carlos has been in this line of work for 18 years.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe enjoys his work because it allows him to have time to spend with his family.  In addition, he is able to take his children to school and to different places as needed.  Carlos remembers starting out in this line of work at a very young age.  Over time, he gained experience as a result of the days of work that were sometimes uncomfortable because of the intense heat of the sun or the heavy rains that would inundate some parts of the city.  Carlos hopes to continue working   and supporting his family without problems so that they can grow.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his third loan with MFP.  Carlos is very pleased to know that he will have financial support since he is confident that he will advance his business.  In addition, he promises once again to complete his payments just as he did with his previous loans.  He is grateful to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.  With the loan of 1500 PEN that he requested, Carlos will buy a few spare parts for his motorcycle taxi.  In addition, he will renew his documents that have already expired.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1014012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts for his motorcycle taxi and to renew his driver's license.

husband and two small children live in the town of Belaya Tserkov, not far from Kiev.  She sells vegetables, fruits, seeds for planting and also tools for gardening and farming.  Nataliya wisely included a small add-on cost to the products she sells.  A combination of factors, such as a good, well-traveled place of business, heating in the kiosk, where vegetables and fruits for sale are stored, working directly with product suppliers, give Nataliya certain advantages in running the business as compared to her competitors.  Nataliya has been involved in this business for three years.  Having started her own business due to the absence of regular work with a decent salary, she is only glad now that she once decided to open her own business.

The lack of capital was one of her obstacles but thanks to work with MFP and her own efforts she was able to acquire a house and a car that V\u00edctor, her husband, drives providing transportation services.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to expand production so that later she can move to the city of Tarma because her oldest son needs to study a professional or technical career.  This will be loan #11 from MFP thanks to your help which is why she commits to be punctual with her monthly installment payments.  \r\n\r\nHer communal bank is called \u201cR\u00edo Blanco\u201d and she feels happy to be part of solid, mutually supportive group.  If she were to receive the money, she\u2019ll be able to buy three sacks of pea seeds to start another planting in July.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1016994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three sacks of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446589}],"funded_date":"2012-03-11T00:00:59Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":398127,"name":"Mari","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mari de 39 a\u00f1os, convive con Miguel de 43 a\u00f1os, con quien tiene 2 hijos de 12 y 9 a\u00f1os.

She has been in this business for 15 years and she works with her husband's help.  The couple both provide haircuts and hairdos.  In this way, they manage to provide financially for their household.  Gloria will use the loan she has requested to buy essential items for her salon as she lacks some things she needs for her business to grow.  For example, she needs chairs so that she can make her customers more comfortable, all kinds of scissors and other items which will help her to carry out her work.\r\n\r\nThis will be Gloria's 12th loan from MFP and she once again hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can carry out her work.  She is an active and supportive member of her community bank.  Gloria will use her 1,500 soles to buy materials she needs for her hairdressing business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials and furniture for her hairdressing salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446591}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T02:23:14Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":398771,"name":"Wastaarabu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hidaya, who is in her early 30s, is married and has two children who go to school.

She is 42 years old and, thanks to her hard work, she owns her own home which is made from solid building materials.  She lives here with her two beloved daughters, 21-year-old Yanina and 16-year-old Yuli, who she is devoted to.  Thanks to her perseverance and, above all, the hard work she does, Elizabeth managed to buy a rice-hulling machine.  She has been in this business for 20 years now and it is very easy for her to carry out her work as she really enjoys it.  Her main customers are people from her town who grow rice.  At harvest time they bring their crops to Elizabeth's workplace so that she can hull their sacks of rice.  Elizabeth normally works alone but she had to hire a laborer to support her in filling the grain sacks that mount up.  Over time, she would like to be able to expand her business as it is how she provides for her family, especially for her daughters' education.  Right now, her priority is to finish work on the outside of her house as she needs to refurbish it with some paint.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Elizabeth's third loan from MFP and she is grateful for your cooperation which will allow her to continue carrying out her plans.  She pledges to continue making her repayments on time.  Elizabeth is a supportive member of her community bank.

He is also kind and chivalrous.  He lives with his partner Juliana who is a housewife and the mother of his three children Juan, Ami and Frank, who are 6, 2 and 1.  They live together in their own home that they bought with their savings.\r\n\r\nFrancisco works as a welder, a trade that he learned on the job when he used to work as an assistant in somebody else's metal shop.  Now he works in a friend's workshop and earns a percentage for the work that he does.  He started out in this business more than seven years ago and, up to now, he has worked in his friend's workshop.  He previously worked as a fish seller which he considered to be hard work.  He decided to change to welding because he saw that it made more profits.  He considers his work to be fairy profitable.  It makes him good money and doesn't take him much time to do.  Before he started out in this business he was experiencing financial difficulties as his previous business did not provide him with good results and he considered it hard going.  He often failed to provide for his family's needs.  However, with his new trade he is now making better profits.  He would like to use them to buy a fast food cart which his partner will work on selling fast food.  In this way, the couple will support each other in covering their household expenses and will both look to make progress.\r\n\r\nThis will be Francisco's eighth loan from MFP.  He is happy and grateful to know that he will continue having a line of credit so that he can make progress in his business.  He feels very comfortable with his community bank as he considers its members to be nice, supportive people.  Francisco will invest the sum of 1,800 soles that he has requested in buying a fast food cart so that he can establish a new business for his partner.  The cart is worth 780 soles.  He will use the remainder of the money to buy the ingredients needed to prepare fast

She lives in their own house with her husband Edmundo, aged 69, and their daughter Haydee, aged 29, to whom she provides a good home. Juaquina is an elderly person, yet she works tirelessly to offer a better quality of life to her daughter. She has a carpentry store where her husband Edmundo works: he makes furniture, tables, chairs, etc.; Juaquina sells the furniture in her store. Sometimes there are people who have their furniture specifically made according to their own design.\r\n\r\nJuaquina's greatest desire is to finish the construction of the family home with noble building materials, because now it is made of wood. Since the beginning of her credit history with loans from the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma, she did very well and has managed to fully equip their carpentry store. This will be her 17th loan with the institution and she is very happy that she can rely once more on its financial support, because she feels that she can safely pursue her goals with it. In addition, she likes to be a member of her communal bank, where she has always worked with responsible and supportive people. Juaquina will use her loan to finish the construction of her home; she will buy cement and metal sheets, and ultimately enjoy peace and quiet with her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1017079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement and metal sheets to finish the construction of the family home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juaquina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446593}],"funded_date":"2012-03-06T22:29:05Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":400366,"name":"Shavkatjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 4 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e. \u041e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 2000$ \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.","en":"Shavkatjon is an honest and hardworking person.

married and has three children. She tells us that she has managed a small general store for the past three years, set up in her house. She is requesting a loan in order to extend her business and invest in staple food products, as sometimes her customers come and ask for products which she does not have for saleat the moment. She is grateful to Kiva for this help in excelling.\r\n\r\nAlso in the duo is \u00c1ngela Isamar, who is 20 years old and is single. She makes a living cutting and sewing typical blouses (g\u00fcipiles) to later sell in old Guatemala. She tells us that she needs a loan to be able to buy cuts of fabrics to sew as she is being asked for more stock but typical clothing is very expensive and she does not have enough capital to invest. Also, she has a sister who helps her sewing but she doe not have material in order to be able to extend her business. For this reason she needs the support to be able to sell more, as people from other communities also order from her. She has to ask for more time as she does not have enough material. She hopes and wishes that she can receive help as she wants to support her family with her work, now that it is going well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1014228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy staple everyday food products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Juan Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Nazaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Isamar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.19,"local_amount":664.3,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":681.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016817},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":342.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206876},{"amount":79.75,"local_amount":607.6,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":623.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315909},{"amount":97.59,"local_amount":743.53,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":762.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551665},{"amount":48.3,"local_amount":368,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":377.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377923},{"amount":121.36,"local_amount":924.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":948.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308388247},{"amount":47.06,"local_amount":358.59,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":367.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372776}],"funded_date":"2012-03-11T01:54:14Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:58:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":398991,"name":"Safina Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha, who is in her mid-30s, is a married mother of two children, both of whom attend school.

During the week, Erlinda works as a seamstress, making garments of different designs.  In addition, she produces a few pillowcases, furniture covers, and bedroom sets.  She has a small space that is equipped and located in a strategic area of her house where she does all of her work.  Erlinda has been in this business for a long time.  Occasionally she receives help from her daughters or her granddaughter.  She sells what she produces on the weekends to friends, neighbors, and other customers looking to buy a high-quality bedding set at a good price.  Erlinda enjoys her work because it allows her time to take care of her animals and crops since farming is one of her favorite hobbies.  She has many plans for the future and wants to continue growing her business to make it prosper.  In the past few months, she has encountered many problems.  For example, the motorcycle taxi that she rents out was robbed.  She refuses to look back and is always moving forward to improve her situation.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her 12th loan with MFP.

frutas ubicado por el centro de la ciudad en donde va en busca de sus proveedores quienes le dan la mejor calidad, despu\u00e9s vuelve a su casa pues los clientes est\u00e1n en espera para los

She shares her life with her partner, living together in the home that they bought together. They also live with their 3 children who are her reason for everything she does. She provides her children with a good standard of education and hopes to provide them with a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda starts work early in the morning when she goes out in search of the region's freshest and best fruits. She heads to the fruit market located in the city centre where she tracks down her suppliers, who always give her their best quality produce. Later, she returns to her home where her clients are waiting to buy from her so that they can give their school-aged children their breakfasts. She works from her own home and her children help her out; her husband works as a transport driver and together they bring a decent wage into the home.\r\nIn all the time that she has been working in this role, she has learned that nothing can be wasted and she makes ice-cream and jams out of the fruits that are too ripe and close to spoiling. She likes her work as it involves her family, who help her out, and after working at her business in the mornings, she has the afternoons free. She hopes to grow her business as she has every wish and desire to exceed her own expectations.\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, as such she is counting on their collaboration in order to continue working towards her aims. On the other hand, she is also committed once again to fulfilling the repayment schedule just as she did with her previous loan. She is very happy about being a member of her communal bank as the people involved are good, pleasant and very supportive. With the requested loan amount of 1500 NS, she will buy more fruit for her business as the start of the school year is close at hand and she wants to satisfy her clients, as well as buying bananas because the price is starting to rise and she wants to buy a larger quantity to increase her earnings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a greater range of fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.64,"local_amount":220.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":226.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099874},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":229.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":235.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714005},{"amount":95.76,"local_amount":249.81,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":256.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202902},{"amount":99.33,"local_amount":259.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098572},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":263.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":270.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401412},{"amount":106.37,"local_amount":277.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":284.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455706}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T12:39:56Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Reiss","image":798183}},{"id":398044,"name":"Hellena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellena lives in Airport.

She is married and the mother of two daughters who are 26 and 12 years old.  She lives in her own home together with her husband and one of her daughters who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEstela's business is working in the multi-service business that she has in her home where she sells a large variety of office supplies, basic household products and personal care products.  Her business is well stocked and she has a bit of everything.  In addition, she provides her services as a seamstress, in some cases making garments to her customers' specifications and, in other cases, making her own creations.  She has been in this line of work for five years and works together with her daughter who helps her to serve her customers when she is busy with her sewing.  What she likes about her work is that she is able to carry out two activities at once.  In addition, she always has income and very good customers since she now has a contract with a fancy dress store who she supplies every week.  She hopes, in the future, to be able to expand her store and build a workshop where she can sew more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be Estela's ninth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support as it will make her feel more secure in making progress in her business.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loans.  Estela enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will use the 1,000 soles she has requested to buy more materials and products for her businesses because she always wants to keep her customers happy and not lack anything that they are looking for."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1014105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy office supplies and personal products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":153.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.4,"local_amount":145.06,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":145.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099844},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":153.21,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":153.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713974},{"amount":62.65,"local_amount":167.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":167.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202870},{"amount":64.98,"local_amount":173.28,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":174.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098540},{"amount":66.11,"local_amount":176.31,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401362},{"amount":69.41,"local_amount":185.09,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":186.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455666}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T15:51:47Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":399153,"name":"Nath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nath is a 44-year-old single parent who has been living together with only a daughter, age 25, in Kompong Cham province.

She works a lot because she wants to provide her family with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nEvelin's work is selling food. When the night begins to fall, she goes out with her table and chairs to the sidewalk in front of her home to begin her working day. The type of food she sells is very special, since she prepares it with local ingredients and supplies, it has excellent seasoning, and she knows how to treat customers so that they always want to come back. She learned all of these sales tips during her time working. At the beginning it was very complicated, but she was able to adapt and become an excellent salesperson. She has done this work for more than a year, and she does it alone because in this way she feels more comfortable, and it lets her earn a better income.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is the time that she has at her disposal during the day so that she can care for her small children. Her sales are always moderate, but she hopes that in the future she can expand her business. She also wants to buy herself a moto-taxi so that she can rent it out and earn an additional income with it. This will be her third loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support, because this helps her feel more secure about moving ahead with her business.
