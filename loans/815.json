Her house is located in the department of Ica.  The department of Ica is the only one on the south coast that is formed of plains.  It also has coastal prairies, since the mountain range of the Andes is far inland.  In Ica there are many deserts, such as the Pampas de Lancha and the Pampas de Villacuri, where the heat is intense.  It features beaches and hot springs, various marine fauna, site museums and excellent hotel services.  As a good Peruvian, she likes food a lot and one of her favorite dishes is the delicious \"Aji de Gallina\" (Chili Pepper Chicken).  She only studied until the fifth year of middle school, but she would have liked to study to be a teacher.  Because of this she works hard to give her son what he needs so that he can be better than her.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort and more than anything all the help from her husband, Yiovanna achieved having her own business selling clothing, to which she dedicates about 10 hours a day.  She can serve up to 20 customers each day.  She believes that her business is successful because she sells quality products at good prices and because of this her customers always return to her business.\r\n\r\nYiovanna is very thankful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help she will be able to buy more merchandise, and especially summer clothing.  This will allow her to have better revenue and so continue struggling to complete her greatest dream: \"to give a good education to her son and to have her own shop in the

He says that they gave the group this name because they invest all of the loans requested in their businesses so that they can give their families a better quality of life.  Tono, as he is known by his community, is 28 years old and single, and has had a garage for 6 years. He says that he learned this business because it has attracted his attention since he was a child. In secondary school he took a mechanical workshop where he learned to repair cars, and because of this he opened his own workshop.  He says that he is requesting this loan to buy tools, and that each tool is quite expensive.  He also says that he rents the land where his garage is located and which he occupies for parking and for overnight vehicle storage.  He says that his goal and his dream is to buy a large piece of land where he can put his garage and where he does not pay rent as this is money out of his pocket.  For this reason he is making great efforts to become known as a good mechanic. The other ten members of the group are also very hard-working and responsible people.  Their names are Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Gloria, Maria del Carmen, Eva, Maricela, Lucila, Clara, Esmeralda and Esther.

Her story began when she used to drop her son off at school every morning, preferring to use a mototaxi to get there. While chatting with the drivers along the way she came to the conclusion that it's a profitable business and so she decided to get together the money to buy a vehicle and get her license. She's been working for a year now and says it's going very well. She works alone every day and crime can be a problem. She's married and has children. Her biggest dreams are to have more vehicles to put to work, to have a house built of cement, and to give her children everything they need. For that reason she's asked for the loan for her business.

There she sells basic household products and a whole range of different brands and flavors of drinks.  She is the only person who sells these types of drinks so she is well known in her town.  In addition, she also owns a bus with which she provides a public transport system on known routes in the city.  She hires a driver to take care of this business.  However, the business activity that provides her with the most financial satisfaction is making bricks in a factory that she owns.  There she works alongside assistants who she pays according to how much they produce.  She says that she makes an average of 25,000 bricks a month and sells them in a well-known market.  This is where she sees the profits she makes from her work.

Silvio and his wife have lived together with their children in Chimor\u00e9 for many years.\n\nSilvio is a truck driver on a route that runs between provinces in the Tropic of Cochabamba area.  Like many people, he works extra hours so that he can provide his family with a better standard of living.  In an attempt to make more journeys, he suffered a traffic accident.  As he was tired, Silvio fell asleep for a few moments on a return journey.  Luckily, there were no personal injuries or material damage.  However, he ended up in a ditch in the oncoming lane and his engine suffered a blow which left it seriously damaged.  It managed to get him home but, shortly after, it stopped working.  Silvio has other debts that he pays off each month.  If he doesn't manage to fix his engine, he will be left without his main source of income and will fall further into debt.\n\nSilvio's wife works as a seamstress and makes a low income.  Right now, Silvio needs a small loan with interest that he can afford to pay so that he can restore his vehicle and thereby keep working.  This will enable him to pay his debts and support his family as he has always done.  For this reason, he came to us to request a loan because he found out about our Kiva loans.  Silvio was very interested to learn about this type of loan and the fact that he could benefit from them.\n\nSilvio hopes that his children will enjoy a better future.  He also hopes to pay off his debts and offer his family a better quality of

Some years ago, Tatiana was trained as a beautician and personal care specialist in an academy in the city. And with the little resources she had, Tatiana took advantage of her knowledge, installing a beauty salon in her home. She performs diverse services there: tinting, hair cuts, and nail painting, among other things. She works from Monday through Saturday, from 8:00 am until 8:00 pm, and at times, even later if her customers require her services. Also, Tatiana sells products, beauty treatments, and cosmetics in her shop.

All of Carlos\u2019s generators are bio-fueled machines and work solely on vegetable oil or in accordance with it. Along with distributing in Florida, where he now resides, he set up his strongest ties throughout the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Ecuador. Most of the sales come in the form of large wholesales; however, he is also open to the public market as well. Along with the actual equipment, Carlos also offers support and warranties for his sales. The business is set up so that the buyer pays a down payment on the equipment before actual sale; however, this never covers the entirety of the purchase. The sale is paid in full only after delivery. Due to this, Carlos is left putting up much of the initial cost.

In search of a financing source for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1997 with a purchase of livestock with 50,000 som (KGS).

She is married to Tomas, her business partner, and is a mother to six children. Together, Sofia and Tomas work hard to provide a safe and secure future for their family.\r\nSofia operates a piggery business. Live pigs are raised, slaughtered, and then sold to members of the immediate community. Sofia has many customers who also buy live pigs to be sold in the market. Many customers prefer Sofia\u2019s products since they are assured of their quality. It is also a little cheaper to buy live pigs directly from her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. Sofia earns a minimum of 550 PHP in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Sofia is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy additional hogs and feed needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nSofia hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day, and able to finish their studies. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.*\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1019900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional hogs and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-07T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-06T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998033},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606573},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095430},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.97,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3561.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359053},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":712.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294302937}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T13:47:46Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":399599,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a 42-year-old food stall owner in Mshomoroni, Mombasa.

For seven years she has been renting avocado and peach orchards whose fruit she picks and then sells in the local wholesale food market by the bucket.  She says that she really enjoys her work because it leaves her time to care for her children as she goes out very early in the morning to sell her fruit and in the afternoon she is free to do her housework.\r\n\r\nTrinidad is married to Jes\u00fas who also sells fruit.  The couple have two children: 9-year-old Eduardo who is in elementary school and 18-year-old Mayra who is in high school.  Trinidad says that she is requesting a loan so that she can rent an additional orchard which will make her a little more profit so that she can have a little more money saved up for dealing with any emergencies that her daughter or any other members of her family might experience.  Trinidad's daughter Mayra has suffered from childhood-onset diabetes since she was 11 years old and she has to be alert because sometimes her blood sugar levels rise.  She has to keep control of the situation, both in terms of what she eats and her medication, so that she doesn't fall ill because medicines are very expensive.  Trinidad's goal is to own her own orchard.

What he most likes about his work is harvest season because this is when he sees the result of all his hard work.  He sells his coffee beans to middlemen in the city of La Merced and makes good profits.  He says that he picks his bananas every two weeks and they make him income with which to cover his daily expenses.  Right now Walter would like to put together a larger amount of working capital so that he can sow a larger quantity of coffee.

She lives in Telpaneca, Esteli.  She is the mother of 3 children.  She started this business with a loan that that she was given.  She recalls that it was very small, and was used to buy some supplies since she lacked working capital.  Prior to this business, she used to sell clothing and enchiladas from place to place, but she realized that by selling tortillas she could earn a better income more rapidly than she did by selling clothing.  She gets up very early to work in her humble kitchen so that she can have the hot tortillas ready to sell to her customers, who seek her tortillas for their breakfast to eat with cheese curds and a cup of coffee.  She wants to use this loan to buy corn, firewood and limes, which are the supplies she needs in making tortillas.  This will also help her to have an inventory of supplies available for those times when these supplies increase in price.  In the future she expects to make improvements to her house, by fixing up the kitchen where she makes her tortillas.

This business provides many services including remodeling, roofing repairs, and window replacement for residential and commercial building projects. Recently, Julio has also moved his business into providing services for government projects. This shift, however, has proven to be very difficult, as well as a growing point for his business. The government projects pay the private businesses that provide the service after completion and this has exhausted much of the business' resources.

He is part of the Las Abejitas Trabajadoras (The Little Worker Bees) group, and he says they gave themselves this nickname because they are very hard workers willing to fight for a better life. Jorge has made a living baking bread for more than four years after a friend taught him the trade at a time in his life when he didn't have a job and had to make headway for his son, so his friend offered to teach him. Jorge says that he is requesting this loan to purchase ingredients to bake bread, such as milk, eggs, flour, firewood, sugar, butter and other times. He sells the bread in different stores in town. The stores make their orders, and he delivers the bread very early. He is very excited about the loan because it will increase his sales as he will invest a little more in the ingredients. One of his goals is to purchase a motor-scooter so he can make his deliveries more quickly and be able to sell his products on the city streets. The other members of the group are Cristina, Elizabeth, Rosa, Mariana, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana, Teresa, Alma Delia, Sandra, Georgina and Yazmin, and they plan to invest their loans in the businesses, such as furniture making, selling fruits and candies, sewing handicrafts, selling party supplies, selling perfumes, making tamales, selling quilts via catalog, and selling women's cosmetics via catalog.

From this farming business, she is able to earn an average of USD 2.00 a day to cover her daily expenses. Her husband works in the same business as her, rice farming. \r\n\r\nBesides the crop-growing business, Tem\u2019s husband also acts as a horse driver for all the passengers and villagers who need to travel in and around their community or need to have someone pick up their merchandise. Presently, his existing horse is getting old and it cannot support him while running his business. That is why Mrs. Tem would like to borrow a loan to purchase a new horse for her husband so he can run his business as before. In the future, Tem hopes she can expand her crop-planting business, to repair her house and enroll her children in a high level of education.

For much of her life she has done various types of work to provide her children with a good education and quality of life. Now her children have professions and are independent. In the meantime she lives in her own house, with her husband and one of her daughters.\r\n\r\nLourdes sells meals, which she does on the porch of her house. She has her daughter's help, with whom she has been working in this business for almost two years now. During this time she has learned many things; from how to treat customers to how to have very good seasoning that makes grilled fish delicious and juicy; and to offer her diners juanes (pieces of meat with rice, wrapped in banana leaves) that are the most delicious in the area where she lives. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work since she can enjoy herself at the same time as she generates income. In addition, she really likes working alongside her daughter, who is her main support in the business. The business is located in a very busy avenue, so she always has customers to whom she offers the best. They  go away delighted with the friendliness of the service, and with how affordable the prices are. She wishes to continue working, and later on, continue expanding her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, so she is hoping for your help so that she can continue toward her goals. Moreover, she promises to once again make her installment payments on time, and demonstrate, as on earlier occasions, that she is a very good member. In this way she will repay the support that they provide her in her communal bank, where everyone is very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the 1,500 nuevos soles applied for, she will buy ingredients, supplies, and a few cooking utensils in order to continue doing her work. In addition, she will add a few tables and chairs to be able to give more comfort to her customers when she is serving them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy food and cooking utensils for preparing more meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.67,"local_amount":220.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":226.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099873},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":229.18,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714004},{"amount":95.79,"local_amount":249.89,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":256.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202901},{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":259.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098571},{"amount":101.09,"local_amount":263.73,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":270.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401411},{"amount":106.23,"local_amount":277.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":284.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455705}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T04:42:13Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":399710,"name":"Aker","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aker lives in Bor.

This will enable her to teach indigenous children who speak <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mazahua_language\" target=\"_blank\" >Mazahua<\/a> since this is the predominant culture and language in her community.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol is married to Sr. Constantino and has two children, a daughter in fifth grade and a son who is in second grade.  She and her husband buy and sell scrap iron that is brought in every day from the neighboring areas around her town.  These items include doors, batteries, radiators, and other objects.  Marisol sells all of these items in the town of Hidalgo since there is a recycling center that buys iron and scrap metal.  She says that she and her husband decided to start this business because he was involved in a serious accident at a sawmill.  Since he was not able to continue working, they decided to sell iron that could be sold at a later time.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol is requesting a loan to buy iron and gasoline for transporting the iron.  One of her worries is her older daughter who occasionally suffers from asthma attacks.  For this reason, she and her husband must work very hard in order to buy the medicines needed to keep her illness under control.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol says that one of her goals is to buy another truck that will help her husband buy and sell iron in other communities.  The other six group members are Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Sonia, F\u00e9lix, Eduardo, Elvia, and Javier.

Octavia Q. - 35 years old - will use her money to buy two pigs and eight turkeys, as well as feed and corn with which to fatten them, so that she can later sell them.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is called Irma and she is 35 years old.  She has been married to Antonio for 19 years.  Antonio carries out building jobs in their community.  The couple have five children.  Their eldest is a son who is 19 years old, single, and currently works.  Next they have a daughter called Rosaura who isn't currently studying.  They also have a 10-year-old son who is in fifth grade, an 8-year-old who is in third grade and their youngest who is a 2-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nIrma is requesting this loan so that she can start buying and selling animals such as pigs and chickens.  She decided to join this group because she was invited by a neighbor and also because she was very keen to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nIrma says that she will carry out her business in the following way: once she has received her loan, she will buy her young animals in her community and take them home.  She says that she would like to set up a small pen where she can raise them appropriately.  She has great faith that this will be a good business and will help her to improve her family's life if it goes well.  Once she has her animals home, she will buy them feed and ground corn so that they grow.  She will later sell them and recoup what she invested.  She says that she will sell the animals in her community without having to travel far.  She is very happy to be able to receive this loan as she says that previously, owing to a lack of money, she couldn't even imagine managing to start something like this.  Irma describes herself as a very respectful and hard-working person.  \"I like to help my husband because there are no jobs here and we have to find a way to make progress\", comments Irma.  This loan, without doubt, will help her to start her business and improve her life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1018726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044511},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656702},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317374},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418760}],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T01:31:53Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":399118,"name":"Huitzililla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Cruz va a comprar perfumes y cosmeticos, la se\u00f1ora Eleuteria va a comprar sorgo y maiz molido, la se\u00f1ora Tomasa va a comprar pan, mayonesa, jamon, verduras para preparar tortas, el resto de las integrantes siguen en su actividad que vienen desarrollando.

This group is made up of nine very hard-working and cheerful women who make their sales in order to earn a little extra money and provide their children with a better quality of life.  They live in a community which is noted for being in a sugarcane region.  Their husbands work in the fields (sowing and cutting sugarcane).\r\n\r\nObdulia is 41 years old and studied up to high school level.  She is a single mother and has three children.  Her eldest child is called Karen and she is 19 years old.  She is studying at university.  15-year-old Brenda is in high school and 9-year-old Luis Angel is in elementary school.  Obdulia tells us that she has always had to work to provide for her children and pay for their education.  A little over 10 years ago she started selling chicken together with her friends and neighbors in her community.  However, over time, and as a result of the hard work her whole family has carried out in order to get themselves ahead in life, they have managed to become suppliers.  They currently supply chicken to all the ladies who sell in their community.  The work that Obdulia and her family carry out requires a lot of effort and work as they must get up at 5 o'clock in the morning to start seasoning the chicken which they then go out to deliver to their customers.  She says that she sells more and more every day and that her business is gradually growing.  Obdulia needs this loan to invest in buying more chickens so that she can continue making her sales.\r\n\r\nObdulia hopes that this investment will allow her business to continue making progress as she would like her business to continue growing so that she can pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nMinerva - bakery\r\nEsther - selling groceries\r\nFlor - selling corn\r\nMadai - selling corncobs and fruit\r\nLeticia - selling clothing\r\nMaria - selling sweet treats\r\nAtanacia - selling tacos\r\nCristina - selling groceries\r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they are providing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1017982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tembladera Vista Hermosa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Atanacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madai De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":796.88,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044513},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6810.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656704},{"amount":796.87,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317376}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T16:56:48Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":399121,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Wimpillay - Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR DE WIMPILLAY - II\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco. \nLa socia es la Sra.

This town is noted for the high level of commercial activity among its residents.  In the surrounding area one finds the Ungara Fortress, the last trace of the Huarco culture, ancient Ca\u00f1ete.  There are also old haciendas on vast expanses of farmland.\r\n\r\nNestor is the father of two young children who are 11 and 12 years old.  He loves his children very much.  The children's mother left him several years ago and he had to start a new life in order to provide for his children.  He works hard for his children every day so that he can provide them with the best in life.  Nestor studied auto mechanics.  As he also enjoyed photography, he signed up for a course and bought a camera but one day he was mugged and lost the camera.  This meant he was not longer able to continue studying.\r\n\r\nNestor currently works very hard as a motorcycle taxi driver.  He works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 50 customers a day.  Sometimes he also works on construction sites because he tells us that every job is good, especially when it is honest.  Nestor believes that his business is doing well.  He works hours that allow him to transport a lot more passengers and spend more time with his children.\r\n\r\nNestor is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he will be able to build a garage.  This improvement will provide him with a safe place to keep his motorcycle taxi and he will no longer have to keep it elsewhere which will give him more money and he will be able to continue working towards his biggest dream: to provide his children with a good education and improve their quality of

 She is a mother of two-school age children who live with her and her spouse.  She is in the business of cultivating rice.  It\u2019s the only business she has been with, for over 10 years.
