They have already given her four loans to buy livestock. Reyna Isabel is very grateful for this help, because thanks to these loans she had increased her stock of cattle. This has provided her with benefits such as milk from the cows, which she uses to feed her family, and income from selling calves. She invests this money in home improvements. \r\n\r\nReyna Isabel currently needs another loan to buy calves. Her plan is to fatten them up and sell them in a year\u2019s time. With the proceeds she hopes to buy a property or make improvements to her home. She hopes that Ceprodel will help her once again, since this is the only way she will be able to fulfil her aims.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1018893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20263.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356473347}],"funded_date":"2012-03-19T08:33:25Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:05:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Toal","image":null}},{"id":399140,"name":"Las Amigas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jos\u00e9 Medardo es casado con 4 hijos, algunos de sus hijos son estudiantes y dependen de el, su esposa se dedica a la venta de zapatos y ropa nueva.

The members are hard-working entrepreneurs who look for opportunities to get ahead and with their daily efforts hope to give their children a better future. \r\n\r\nIsabel, (the one with her hand up in the photo), lives in the city of Cusco. Cusco is a well-known tourist destination because of its traditional fiesta of the sun, \u201cInti Raymi\u201d and because it is the stepping stone to one of the wonders of the world, \u201cMachupicchu\u201d.\r\nIsabel tells us that she sells food. She has a restaurant where she serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. She opens at 7 in the morning and closes at 9 in the evening, Monday to Sunday. She\u2019s been running this business for many years now and it\u2019s going quite well.

After seeing no future in his town, he decided to move a few years later to Mexico City where he enrolled in beauty school and learned the skills of the trade very well.  As a young boy, he enjoyed giving haircuts so he chose this career because he saw that it would be a good business.  He now has an aesthetics practice in town that he started seven years ago.  One of his challenges is being able to pay the rent since the rates have gotten so high.  Rodrigo says that he is requesting a loan to buy beauty products such as cr\u00e8mes, makeup, nail polish for manicures and pedicures, shampoo, dyes, bleaches, and liquid products used on the hair.  He indicates that all of the products that are used on his customers are purchased in Mexico City from different stores that offer low prices.  This allows him to earn some profit.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nLuzviminda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan.

What she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers, then sells them per piece\/pack for a profit. Products can range from ham, hotdogs, processed pork, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMay hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

This will allow her to meet the needs of all of her customers, and at the same time do her best for her family, as she wishes to improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe is known for her high degree of responsibility, due to the fact that she has been our client previously, and has fulfilled all her commitments in a timely way."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1019409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jayanca -

","en":"Mirgul is 38 years old, is married, and has 5 children, the youngest of whom is 5 years old.  The source of income for Mirgul's family is her livestock business.  Started in 2000 with 5,000 som (KGS) her holdings now bring in around 2,000 som (KGS) per month.  The earnings from her business allow Mirgul to pay for the education of her oldest son, Suyunbek, who is a second year student at the university.

She will use the loan that she received to purchase ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, chiles, onions, mayonnaise, cheese, cream, corn, fish, shrimp, etc. in order to continue her sales.\r\n\r\nElia\u2019s goal is to provide an excellent quality of life and education to her son so that he will have a very good professional career. She also wants to make her business grow much more so much that she is thinking of saving in order to build a place of business to install a restaurant in order to expand and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nElia thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva on behalf of herself and her family since, thanks to them, she will be able to improve her life because now she will have an excellent quality of life and financial solvency.\r\n\r\nThe members of El Farito Communal Bank and the businesses they engage in are the following: Maribel-fish shop, Victor Manuel-clothing store, Silvia-fish shop, Elia-food sales, Mar\u00eda Magdalena-fish shop, Eliodora-groceries, Ricarda-food sales, Maribella-butcher\u2019s shop, Inocente-fish shop, Constancio-fish shop and Jes\u00fas-pharmacy.

This story is about Mrs. Le\u00f3nides, one of the members of the group. She is 42 years old and married to Mr. Eleazer. They have four children, two of whom are in the first and second year of high school, and the older two are married. She has worked selling corn for 19 years.\r\n<p>\r\nShe says she decided to start this work because she wanted to look for a way to help her husband with the expenses of the home and her children's education. She also wanted to improve her quality of life and be financially stable. The loan given her will be used to buy corn in bulk to continue her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nThe goal Le\u00f3nides has given herself is to offer a very good education to her children so that they choose a major and dedicate themselves to an excellent profession and then have a better future. She also wants to grow her business a lot more, and is planning to start building a grocery store to have an assortment of products to improve and increase her income. Le\u00f3nides thanks FRAC and Kiva because, thanks to them, she has been able to have her own business and change her life and that of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nOther group members in addition to Le\u00f3nides are: Rafaela, Guadalupe, and Claudia.

With this   loan, he plans to achieve an average monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which will allow him to bolster his working capital, honor his obligations to Soro Yiriwaso and provide for some family needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1029406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy clothing [for resale].","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-25T08:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168944.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251937},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168944.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502795},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":168944.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102916}],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T15:06:18Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":399056,"name":"Reymundo Ricardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reymundo hombre trabajador, comerciante sus proyectos es ir cambiando poco a poco la infraestructura de su vivienda, con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior invirti\u00f3 en la reposici\u00f3n del techo.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan.

The loan she got will be invested in the purchase of chilies, tomatoes, onions, green beans, potatoes, carrots, lettuce, avocadoes, chayotes, apples, melons, papaya, peaches, oranges, grapes, etc. to have her stand better stocked.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Flor (as she\u2019s better known in her community) says that her goal is to cause her business to grow businesswise because she wants to build a locale to install her fruit store in and also to have it well stocked with more variety of products to thus obtain more and better profits.\r\n\r\nShe thanks FRAC and Kiva lenders for giving her the opportunity and for their trust but above all for believing in her because thanks to their support she was able to invest in her business and have a better quality of life alongside her family and a better future.\r\n\r\nThe other people who make up the Virgen del Carmen group are the following: Filadelfo, Faustina, Blanca Flor, Marciana and Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n who work in a variety of occupations like taxi driver, shoe store, fruit and vegetable sales, flower shop and grocery store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1019047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"va a invertir en la compra de chiles, jitomates, cebollas, ejotes, papas, zanahorias, lechugas, aguacate, chayotes, manzanas, melones, papayas, duraznos, naranjas, uvas, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Luis Acatlan,Gro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Filadelfo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4443.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4544.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4784.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4990.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5236.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":347.13,"local_amount":4443.31,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4458.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044523},{"amount":355.05,"local_amount":4544.63,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656717},{"amount":373.82,"local_amount":4784.88,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4801.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317389},{"amount":389.87,"local_amount":4990.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418774},{"amount":409.13,"local_amount":5236.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5254.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568385}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T20:44:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":399059,"name":"Kely Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kely  con 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera con 3 hijos, actualmente esta viviendo en la casa de sus padres en el distrito de cayalti, el cual esta a dos horas aproximadamente de la Provincia de Chiclayo, en su distrito normalmente los habitantes se dedican a la agricultrua.\n\nKely se dedica a la venta de comida preparada desde hace dos a\u00f1os aproximadamente, para lo que sus padres la apoyan con um espacio de su casa, a la fecha ya tiene muchos clientes queines la vistan por el buen sabor y la buena atencion que ella les brinda.

She also wants to make her business grow much more because she\u2019s thinking about building a locale to install her perfume shop so that she can have more assorted merchandise and products that will help her improve and increase her income.\r\nShe says that all her fellow group members are very trustworthy, responsible and, above all, very hardworking people.\r\n\r\nTo\u00f1a (as her fellow group members call her) thanks FRAC and Kiva because thanks to them she\u2019s been able to expand her business and thus change her and her family\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nAntonieta\u2019s other group members are: Flor, Petra Tania, Filem\u00f3n and Joel who carry out a variety of activities like building materials, perfume shop, shoe shop, groceries and fruit shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1019058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more perfume, cream, deodorant, sheets, comforters, bedspreads and curtains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Luis Acatlan,Gro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T18:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T18:20:07Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra  Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filemon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4809.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5419.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5643.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5931.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6196.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":377.87,"local_amount":4809.27,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4853.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656719},{"amount":425.86,"local_amount":5419.98,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5469.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317391},{"amount":443.39,"local_amount":5643.17,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5695,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418776},{"amount":466.04,"local_amount":5931.46,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5985.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568387},{"amount":486.84,"local_amount":6196.12,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6253.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399762}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T20:57:41Z","paid_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":399532,"name":"Ricardo Vinicio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ricardo Vinicio de cuarenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus  hijos en casa propia.
