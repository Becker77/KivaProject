Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.

He has a sewing shop where he makes a variety of garments for all tastes and preferences. He has been doing this for five years, so he has a great deal of experience and is well-known. This business is his main source of income and has allowed him to provide his family's daily bread. His main desire is for his family to have life opportunities different from those he has had. For this reason, he works hard to get his beloved family ahead. He is hard-working, dedicated, and, above all, responsible. This has allowed him to gain the confidence of his neighbours, who like his business more every day. All of this has led him to the decision to request this loan from INTEGRAL to invest in his sewing workshop through the purchase of the necessary basic material (fabric, buttons, elastic, ribbon, thread, etc). This will allow him to serve a higher demand, thus improving his sales levels. This will then allow him to reach his dream of providing his family with a better quality of life.

She is a widow. She manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCrisanta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 42,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCrisanta dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

This has also moved her to make the decision to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in a variety of products for her shop. She will buy rice, beans, milk, coffee, oil, candy, sugar, paper, etc., so her customers will always find what they\u2019re looking for and find satisfaction in her customer service.

She is 43 years old and a resident of Manila, in the Philippines.  Her husband Antonio is a sales manager, and a father to her two children. She together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating a business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nVicky maintains a direct selling business.  She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 4000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12, 000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy more orders for her customers.  She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVicky hopes to be more successful with her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good future through all her hard work.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

She makes a living running a general store and making tortillas out of her home. She has a large customer base because she is known for being a charismatic, hard-working, dedicated and responsible woman. Many people give her good references, so over time her work has earned the confidence of her neighbors. Despite her advanced age she doesn't tire from her work, since for her it's her biggest joy. Her business is very accessible and highly frequented. Marta is very enterprising, so she is always looking for ways to grow her business. Her goal is to be able to meet the demands of a larger market, which is why she has decided to invest in her business so she can increase her sales and profits to improve her quality of life. All of this has brought her to request a loan from Kiva partner Integral, because she doesn't have sufficient funds to invest on her own. She will invest the loan in the purchase of necessary products like corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergent, drinks and other items, so she can make her delicious tortillas and sell the different items in her store. She is confident that with her work and God's help she will be able to achieve her dream of giving her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1019308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergents, drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966381}],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T14:02:33Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":400514,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is 49 years old and married with 2 children.

Despite competition, he tries to get out as early as possible to move a good number of passengers to their various destinations and thus earn a larger amount of income to cover his expenses and personal needs.\r\n\r\nThe 2000 new sol loan he\u2019s asked Edpyme Alternativa for will be to buy a new canopy, renovate the seats and the overall maintenance of his mototaxi that is needed after a certain period of time, to continue providing good customer service and to improve his standard of living. Juan is a hardworking man who wants to get ahead with his family through his own efforts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1019768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"buy a new canopy, renovate the seats and the overall maintenance of his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":139.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":142.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":162.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":175.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":179.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":184.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":192.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":196.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":282.45,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":283.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621381},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":149.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":149.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332750},{"amount":116.61,"local_amount":310.95,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":312.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316937},{"amount":60.45,"local_amount":161.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373774},{"amount":128.91,"local_amount":343.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":345.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368624},{"amount":67.27,"local_amount":179.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":180.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977689},{"amount":69.06,"local_amount":184.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506595},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":192.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506596},{"amount":73.56,"local_amount":196.15,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":196.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058563}],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T16:32:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":400519,"name":"Kalamera Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cKalamera\u201d group.

This has been a profitable project, but not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nSamah is requesting a 2,000 USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing bulk of iron recycled materials to sell. This will increase sales and improve the family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1021840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled

Transportation to his house is scarce so he must hire someone to transport the merchandise, which increases costs.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy basic grains for his store, since he wants to increase his earnings and buy more products to sell.  By having more stock he will be able to increase his income.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jos\u00e9 wants to have a more profitable store and depend less on farming because of his age and the fact that he is no longer strong enough for that type of work.

","en":"Nurinarda is 66 years old and her business is making handicrafts such as backpacks and bags.  She carries out this work every day.  On weekends, she also prepares special food.  She has a 22-year-old son who is studying and it is for him that she is driven to work hard, so that she can make income and improve his well-being.  Nurinarda's daily life consists of caring for children in a 'hogar substituto' (center for vulnerable children) in her home.  This is supported by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, an organization that protects children in Colombia.  This makes her some additional income.  In the afternoons, she makes her handicrafts which also earns her income.  She learned this work by family tradition in her home town of San Jacinto and started working in her own business doing this one year ago. \r\n\r\nOn weekends, Nurinarda prepares and sells empanadas, 'pan prensado' (a type of sandwich), desserts and other treats.  She is also well known for this by her neighbors.  Nurinarda's goal is to position herself in her businesses.  She permanently needs working capital to invest so that her number of customers will continue to increase every day.   This is why she is taking out a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).

All are enrolled in school. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for 9 years. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy more fertilizers and seeds and pay for labor costs to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand his planting area to get more output. In the picture, Faustin holds a Kiva borrower profile that has just been filled out.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

All are enrolled in school. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for 3 years. He would like to get this loan to buy fertilizers and seeds and to pay for labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand his planting area to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

years. Three of them go to school. She has been a rice farmer for 1 year. She would like to get this loan to pay for fertilizers, seeds, and labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, she plans to expand her planting area to get more output. In the photo, she holds a Kiva form as her fellow borrowers look on.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She has three children aged between 4 and 11. All go to school. She has been a rice farmer for nine years. She would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and pay for support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, she plans to expand the area she has been using to get more output. In the picture you see Joe with some of her fellow rice growers sitting behind her.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Its owner, Nathan, is a second-generation contractor with more than 25 years of experience in the construction industry. \r\n\r\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, Nathan was confident that the construction industry would be booming and that his business would be inundated with various projects. However, many residents who were desperate to return to their homes as soon as possible hired cheap labor instead of skilled and licensed contractors like Nathan. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Nathan\u2019s business is prospering and he still believes that the New Orleans business community is very tight-knit, which makes it unique. Nathan is very optimistic about the future growth of his company as he hopes to one day have 10 full-time employees. \r\n\r\nNathan is very grateful for the Kiva program as he believes he would not have been able to get financing elsewhere because of previous health issues.  Nathan will use his Kiva loan for advertising, contract bidding software, and working capital for materials and

To make her goal come true she is asking for additional capital in the amount of PHP25,000, allowing her to buy more stock merchandise for her retail store. Through this loan amount, she would be able to satisfy her customers' demands and economize her transportation expenses in going to and from the market. \r\n\r\nShe knows that she could obtain her goal because of the big impact of her requested loan.

She lives in the city of Cartagena. She is a widow with four children aged 31 to 40 years old. Since her husband died 29 years ago (he had a store in the market where he sold prepared food and groceries), she had to assume responsibility for her children. She closed his business and started to sell various merchandise in the city such as gold and silver jewelry and general clothing. With her business she was able to get her daughters ahead because it went very well for her. This is because of the support she received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has received 17 loans from this organization over 14 years. With this support her life has changed a lot. Her business was very small and she only had one, and now she also generates income and jobs with her microbusiness selling fast food. She has display cases and her income has increased, generating a better quality of life for her. Since her clientele is growing, she requires permanent working capital to be able to respond quickly. The working capital she has is now insufficient and that is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, her 18th loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy materials to make her fast food such as sausages, bread, baloney, cheese and other ingredients. She will also invest in merchandise such as gold and silver jewelry to fill orders her customers have made. Her work experience in her two microbusinesses and the popularity her businesses have in the area make this a potentially great investment that will generate more income to keep fortifying her own wellbeing and that of her family. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1020203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials to prepare her fast food, such as sausages, bread, baloney, cheese, and many more ingredients.

Her husband is Carlos, a technician, and she is the mother of one child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPaulina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPaulina hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1022394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T17:40:11Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":6533,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6990.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998061},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":4666.96,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4993.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606601},{"amount":70,"local_amount":2800.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2996.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095458}],"funded_date":"2012-03-11T02:28:05Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:06:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":400859,"name":"Ernalein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ernalein is thirty-one years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is married to Alan, her business partner, and a mother to her one child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilou operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sell fire wood for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 9000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

She is married to Patrocenio, a pensioner. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArgie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 8000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArgie hopes her business will grow more in the coming years.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
