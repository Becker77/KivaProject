Her husband is Nestor, an employee, and father to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are making as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1022564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1022578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fertilizers, seeds, and support labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2012-03-11T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-10T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestin\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":405000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":405000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":405000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":418600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308285135}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T03:47:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:30:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":399897,"name":"Nubia Yesenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nubia, vive con su familia, su hijo, una prima, sus abuelos, ella es madre soltera, se dedica a atender una tienda de productos dom\u00e9sticos, este surgi\u00f3 por iniciativa propia, trabaja en la casa de habitaci\u00f3n, tiene experiencia en el manejo de este negocio.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de bebidas como gaseosas, refrescos, jugos, gatorade, para surtir el negocio, esta compra le ayudara a mejorar el inventario y poder ofrecerles a los clientes variedad.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Nubia es que a trav\u00e9s de los pr\u00e9stamos pueda crecer, ganando m\u00e1s clientela para as\u00ed asegurar una mejor solvencia econ\u00f3mica. \n","en":"Nubia lives with her family - her son, a cousin and her grandparents.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been planting to get more out, and pay school fees for the children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

He is currently applying for a Kiva loan that he will use to buy the raw materials and items in greater volume, such as iron fittings, zippers, labels, etc, to sell to the expanding market. He wants to move on to succeed in fulfilling his plans of production growth that will help him earn more money and gain more customers.  All this will generate more income and that will improve his own life and that of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1020111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and parts in greater volume such as iron fittings, zippers , labels, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-11T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-10T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52072},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64176},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65673},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67205},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68774},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70378},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72020},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73701},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75421},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":52072,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52667.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651428},{"amount":36.67,"local_amount":64176,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":64909.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141042},{"amount":37.52,"local_amount":65673,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":66423.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100929},{"amount":38.41,"local_amount":67205,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":67973.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338551},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":68774,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":69559.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395115},{"amount":40.21,"local_amount":70378,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":71182.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774930},{"amount":41.16,"local_amount":72020,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":72843.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386924},{"amount":136.97,"local_amount":239702,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":242441.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993792}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T20:13:39Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":400211,"name":"Julia Amavilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia es una mujer de 45 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene muchas aspiraciones en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os de prosperar su v\u00edveres bazar y legumbres su historia empez\u00f3 porque su esposo no ten\u00eda trabajo y quiso emprender un negocio, su trabajo lo hace sola, tiene dificultades, est\u00e1 casada, tiene hijos, su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s importante es seguir adelante con su negocio para seguir manteniendo a mis hijos que est\u00e1n peque\u00f1itos.

They are taking a loan of 190,000 YER.\r\nFawziah is the group leader (she is the second woman from the right, with the blue handbag). She is 52 years old and married. She is a very efficient woman because, she says, aside from caring for her family, she likes to work and thus help her family. She has four adult children who are all studying. She hopes that all her children will be able to conclude their studies. \r\nFawziah's business is selling clothes, which has been her sole source of income for over five years. She started her business selling articles of clothing in the market in her area with limited capital. She says that it is going very well, that her loan has helped her and that she is very satisfied with the support provided. \r\nAt the present time, her business doesn't make more profit due to the difficult situation in Yemen. So she has applied for a loan of 50,000 YER from Kiva partner AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, etc. to sell to customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve the income from her business. In the future, Fawziah would like to buy a house with stores in order to expand her business

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

She is married to Ramon, an employee, and she is a mother to her four children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJoan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJoan hopes to grow her business into a restaurant in her area and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1025109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To pay for raw ingredients needed to make her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-11T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-10T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4666.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998072},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606612},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095469},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359082},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294302953}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T07:40:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":401322,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 41 years old and married with four children.

En este taller le ha ido muy bien y sus planes de crecimiento son muchos, pero su capital de trabajo es insuficiente para hacerlo, tan pronto como \u00e9l quiere. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materias pri,as e insumos para fabricar nuevos dise\u00f1os, como madera pinturas, lacas pegantes, puntillas taches, y tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 un poco en hacer adecuaciones a su taller, poniendo plantilla al piso y una cubierta que le permita trabajar en mejores condiciones especialmente en la \u00e9poca de lluvias.

","en":"Edwin, 44, lives in the city of Cartagena with his wife and their 2 year-old child.  There, in this beautiful and historic city, he works as a carpenter.  He started this business 15 years ago when he was working in a cabinetmaking shop.  Since he really enjoyed this trade, he had the idea of studying architecture, and so he began to improve his work.  Over time, he became quite well-known, and so he decided to start working independently in his own home.  He started up his own business in a workshop, gradually buying the tools and equipment he needed.  His workshop has done very well, and he has a lot of expansion plans, but he lacks sufficient working capital to implement these plans as quickly as he would like.  This is the reason that he came to seek a Kiva loan.  This will be his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it he will buy supplies and raw materials so that he can make some new designs, such as wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and he will also invest some of the money in making some improvements to his workshop.  He will put in new wood flooring and will also add a roof that will allow him to work in better conditions, especially during the rainy season.  His goal for the future is to make his important purchases in bulk so he can obtain a good discount.  To do this, he will prepare to participate in each loan cycle offered by this institution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1020248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and also to make some small improvements to his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Edwin  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86013},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":92686},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":94849},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":97062},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99327},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":101645},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":104016},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":106443},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":108927},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":111469},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":114070},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116731},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":119455},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122242},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125094},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128013},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":131000},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":140958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.46,"local_amount":86013,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87539.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141049},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":92686,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":94331.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395122},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":94849,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96532.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993799},{"amount":397.08,"local_amount":690581,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":702838.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130168},{"amount":595.63,"local_amount":1035871,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1054257.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967482}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T21:22:34Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":401295,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edwin is 27 years old, he runs a butcher shop to earn a living.

She is married to Rolando who is a driver. She has one child. With her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                     \r\n        \r\nRhodora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. \r\n\r\nRhodora hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through her hard work.

Behind him in the photo are agriculture borrowers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of SLL 3,800,000 for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve their standard of living. Thirty-five-year-old Sansie is the leader of this group of teachers. Sansie was born in a place called Nongowa. He is married and has two children, one in secondary school and the other is in college. Sansie is a teacher and has been in the teaching profession for nine years now. He has requested this loan in order to pay school\/college fees for his children. School staff from this institution, like many other school's staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1025343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay school\/college fees for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Koidu\/Kono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T06:50:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sansie\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ahdraman S.

With this loan, they will be able to meet their immediate financial challenges.

After graduating from medical school some years ago, she started working as a dentist in different places and saved money to start her business. \r\n\r\nIn the past, Grisel was running a miscellaneous store, for which she took out two loans. After four years she came to us to take an individual loan to improve her odontological clinic by buying some of the dental instruments and materials she needs.\r\n\r\nGrisel said her most important challenges were to study and become a professional - and now it is to make her dream come true which is \"the one to successful clinic\". \r\n\r\nShe loves her career and she will give of her best to be as good as she can and serve all the people who come to her clinic.

But then they decided to return to their native land and organize their own business in Armenia. \r\n\r\nSo Asatur and his wife have been running a shoe selling business for about 5 years.

From this marriage, she has three children, who are 12, 6, and 2 years old. The two oldest children are studying in high school and elementary school. Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nShe is a homemaker who, in order to have her own resources and with those help her husband with the household expenses, sells catalog clothing and Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women). She sells door-to-door. She works three days a week for two to three hours a day, especially in the mornings when her children are in school. She only has to carry her youngest, as she does not have anyone with whom she can leave him. But this does not keep her from making her rounds, dropping off her products, and collecting every week. She has been doing this trade for a year, and it is going well.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, and catalog clothing, as she has several orders to deliver.  She is the founder of the communal bank and would like the loan because loans are very important to her business. \r\n \r\nHer dream is to have a boutique.\r\n\r\nShe is shown in the photo with her son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1021480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics y clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1540,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":128.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034131},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":258.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646212},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321292},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":258.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208892},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":258.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335217},{"amount":258.37,"local_amount":256.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":258.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391064}],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T02:00:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":401680,"name":"Javzanpagma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Javzanpagma, a 34-year-old hardworking woman, lives with her family in a ger (a traditional Mongolian felt tent) in a ger district which lacks basic infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

The city is known for its traditional culture, its joyful people, and the San Pedro and San Pablo fiestas.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Gladis, age 46.  She is married and has four children.  Two of them are adults, and the two 17 year olds are twins.  They go to school and still live with her.  Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nShe sells clothes and Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories).  She works every day, mostly in the mornings.  This is because that is when it is easier for her to go along her route.  She sells door-to-door and by order.

She also cares for her nephew, whose parents are not able to support him. \r\n\r\nShe initially started a business selling oil, milk, and soap. She had this business for seven years. Since she started receiving loans, she has been able to expand to a more profitable product. She now sells drinks in glass bottles. This is how most soft drinks and beer are sold in the Republic of Congo. Customers return the glass bottles to her and receive a discount on their next purchase of drinks. She will use the loan to buy more glass bottles and drinks for her business. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is the initial cost of the expensive glass bottles and the transportation costs associated with carrying very heavy glass bottles. She hopes to one day grow her business large enough to purchase a vehicle to aid in transporting bottles. Her business strategy is to stock a large variety of drinks.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
