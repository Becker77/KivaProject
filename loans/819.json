All are enrolled in school. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for four years. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output and also renovate the house. \r\n\r\nIn the background of the picture, fellow agriculture borrowers are shown waiting for the photographer.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

David sells harvested nuts and peaches on the local market as well. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Laris. \r\n\r\nDavid has requested credit for fixing the greenhouse. He will change the plastic covering and will get a better harvest as the greenhouse (with new plastic cover) will keep the needed temperature and produce a better harvest.

Thanks to God, she received this business opportunity, which has allowed her to provide for her daughter. \r\n\r\nShe offers the product she sells in factories where many people work. She does not have enough of what she sells because the people buy a lot and she has a large demand from her customers. For this reason, she is asking for this loan to buy more merchandise of shoes and cosmetics. She hopes that Kiva can help her with the loan she is requesting, as well as the other member who makes a living by selling basic products and cosmetics.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1026073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes and cosmetics to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Vista Hermosa, San Pedro Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-03-13T02:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-12T02:40:10Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Yanira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":679.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016828},{"amount":87.46,"local_amount":666.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":678.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206887},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":679.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315919},{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":666.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":679.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850837},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1333.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1358.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551675}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:29:24Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":401790,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 43 years old and has been in farming for five years, producing milk and eggs which she sells to the local market.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

All these borrowers are rice farmers.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations.

Behind him, in the picture, there are a few agricultural workers pictured.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural sector accounts for 37 percent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 percent of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90 percent of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Recently, Viktor's youngest son returned from the army and now works with him and helps him on the farm.  This year, Viktor is expanding his animal husbandry business.

Rosa Mar\u00eda is 42 years old and lives with her partner, who works as a driver and construction worker. She has three children who are 17, 20 and 24 years old. For ten years, Rosa Maria has been running two primary businesses from her home. One is a small grocery store, which supplies basic necessities including cooking oil, rice, and milk.

","en":"Patricia lives in the town of Galapa, 20 minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  She\u2019s a married woman who has three children whose ages range from 20 to 22 years.  She is a tireless worker engaged in a commercial activity through which she sells products via specialized guidebooks or catalogues.  She also buys items independently that are not included in the catalogues and as an additional source of income also sells vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this commercial activity for about 8 years and through this labor is able to help out with a large part of household expenses and she feels very happy to be able to do so.  Her monthly sales generate a good profit margin which allows her to contribute to family spending and cover her personal expenses.  Her husband has a motorcycle that he provides transportation services with and also generates income.\r\n\r\nPatricia\u2019s profit margin is in line with the type of business she operates and her stock rotates quickly.  Lately, her working capital is insufficient to meet growing customer demand and this is why she\u2019s calling upon a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy catalogue items like cologne, face masks, make-up foundation, creams, gels, eyeliner, deodorants and products she has pending orders for taking advantage of sales specials.  She will also invest in her vegetable business buying products that generate good income.  Her investment augurs success because she will apply the discounts to her sales prices thus continuing the process of increasing the number of her regular customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1022065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Together with his family, he is involved in a greenhouse business.  He grows early vegetables, specifically tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes.  Vasilyi owns a large plot of land.  He has four large, 10x60 meter greenhouses and also two greenhouses for seedlings.  He has been involved in growing vegetables for six years.  Annually, he spends about 67,000 hryvnia on seeds and plastic.  Recently, Vasilyi provisioned heating in all of his greenhouses by installing two large boilers.  This significantly improved the quality of his produce.  Currently, Vasilyi needs an additional amount of 20,000 hryvnia to purchase plastic, coal and seeds for his greenhouses for this

She is married to a contractor and has 4 children, aged 15, 13, 11 and 8 years. All are school going children. In 1996, Isatu B established her baby clothing and utensils business. She began her business because she came from a poor background; she had to do petty trading after school hours to pay her school fees. Things got harder for her because she had to drop out of school. She was peddling everyday to help her parents and younger ones. She then got married and her husband helped her with a small amount of funds for the business. Since then, she has developed gradually. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 5,481,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nIsatu would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000.

The loan is another source of generating income, so it is good. She is nervous because she has worked very hard to be where she is now, and she wants her business to grow bigger. She hopes her children will be better people in society. She wants them to achieve what she has not been as fortunate to get. Her only challenge is the fluctuation in transportation costs. Her competitors are few, besides she has more items than they do and of better quality.   \r\n\r\nIsatu serves about 30 customers per day, women and petty traders around town and villages. Her business is popular because she always has good customer care and good quality goods at affordable prices. She usually travels by vehicle three times in the month. and to Conakry once every two months to purchase her goods. She saves some of her profit and uses some as an additional capital for the business.  \r\n\r\nShe has enough savings now that she has acquired a piece of land which she is looking forward to develop.

The Mazahua culture still predominates in this community, where the women wear Mazahua traditional clothing and speak Mazahua. Luci, as her friends and family call her,, is married to Antonio, and they have five children, named Alexis, Marco Antonio, Mercedes, Edgar, and Diana. The last two are in secondary school, and the youngest, Alexis, is in primary school. \n\nLuci sells seasonal fruits that she grows, and she makes typical clothing of the Mazahua culture, which she has been selling in her community for more than 20 years. She says that she is applying for a loan for the purchase of organic fertilizers and for insecticides, since she has a number of avocado, peach, guava, and black cherry trees. She also sometimes grows manzano chile peppers, radishes, and tomatoes at her house, since she has ample land, and when it is the harvest season she says that she sells her fruits and vegetables in a central area in her community. She says that she has been in this business a little more than 5 years and that she did well when she set it up, since it gives her good earnings and thus she can give her children a better quality of life and help her husband with the household expenses. She is very happy because through the loans she has set her sights every higher, and little by little she is making her dream -- to have an orchard in good condition -- a reality. One of her goals is to buy a vehicle, which will facilitate the transport of her fruits and vegetables, since she pays freight charges to transport what she grows. \n\nThe other three members of the

hardworking women who work selling and making traditional clothing.  One of the members of this group is Honoria, a 66-year-old woman.  She is a hardworking and happy woman who has worked since she was little and has learned how difficult it is to have food to eat.\n\nShe works selling sweets, from the cheapest to the most expensive.  She goes to parties in her community so her fellow community members can buy sweets from her.  She tells us that she likes selling her sweets a lot because it gives her good profits.  She has worked selling sweets for ten years.\n\nShe requested the loan to buy more candy, and thread and fabric to make traditional clothing.  She very much likes to weave but what she most likes, and it is her life, is selling candy because it pleases her a lot to sell her candy in the streets of her community.\n\nThe other members of the group are Sof\u00eda, Francisca Felisa, Alba, Elo\u00edna, Sebastiana Hermila, Victoria Mar\u00eda, Emilia, Catalina, Sof\u00eda Honoria, Dominga, and Julia Luc\u00eda, who sell traditional clothing; and Gabriela, who sells groceries and traditional clothing.

The name of the group comes from the fact that its meetings used to be held in a cabin belonging to one of the members.  Consuelo has a silk screen printing workshop which she has been running for ten years.  She makes calendars, agendas, posters, and prints thesis papers, t-shirts or mugs.  She also prints party invitations, brochures, etc.  She claims the business was started by her husband who taughter her how to use the machines to make letters, drawings, embroidery designs, etc.  She rents space for her shop since she does not have room at home for the machines.  The loan she is requesting is to buy ink, paper, bags, calendars and to pay for machine maintenance.  The loan will be very helpful because she has many thesis-printing orders this time of the year and she will be able to obtain the materials she needs for this.\r\n\r\nShe is married to Ra\u00fal and their adult children live independently.  Consuelo's goal is to open a shop in her house so she does not have to pay rent which is expensive and cuts into her profit.\r\n\r\nThe other 13 members of the group are Leticia, Maria del Rosario, Florentina, Maribel, Tomasa, Blanca Estela, Maricela, Martha, Isabel, Liliana, Reynalda, Sof\u00eda, and Alejandra.

She is married and the mother of 1 son who is 5 years old, for whom she wants to provide the best education possible starting at an early age. Jocelyn has, by means of her business, a very good alternate mode of generating income thanks to the fact that she can concurrently care for her son. Jocelyn learned this activity from a friend who had carried out this type of work for a long time and invited her to attend product promotional meetings. Thanks to the excellent attention Jocelyn offers, her business has seen sales increase considerably. She has been able to generate a good income and, little by little, improve her family\u2019s standard of living. With the desire to deliver a large order from a client of hers, she must purchase the necessary products from her provider. However, she currently does not have sufficient capital to do this. For this reason, she has the hope that a loan will afford her the possibility to buy the personal products so that she can fill the large order that her customer has

He does not only sell to neighbors but also to a select clientele which he has built.       \r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to buy a house for his family and have a commercial space for his business that has better conditions than where he is currently located. This is the first loan he has taken out through Kiva, as well as the first financial assistance he has received from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use it to buy raw materials in large quantities like plywood and paint. His investment will be successful because by purchasing in bulk he will get discounts which will increase his profits and also because he has current customers who like his work and who highly recommend him. Aside from working persistently, he also manages an accounts receivable turnover which does not exceed 34 days and has a return on sales not less than 30.7%.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1022124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials in large quantities like plywood and paint.
