She lives with her husband \u00c1ngel and their children Gerson (14), \u00c1ngel (12), and Gabriela (9). Ana and her husband work hard to provide for their family.

is a mother who is dedicated to looking after her children.

The best way that she found to do so was raising sheep and pigs in her own home. The place where they live has a peculiarity since both the rural and urban landscapes live together harmoniously. She has a humble home, but the harmony of a united family prevails there. Her husband is a deliveryman who provides services to a local market using an urban delivery tricycle. Many times, however, his earnings are not sufficient to cover the household expenses, which is why Amalia works so hard raising her livestock and selling them at an affordable price at the local cattle market. She and her husband are convinced that only a good education will bring personal development, since many times not having any skills renders getting a job more difficult. With this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan in order to increase her livestock by purchasing hens because she has seen a demand for them in the area.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children.\r\n\r\nJosefina is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling bed clothes and pots by purchasing a few dozens of each. She will use the profits to invest in her children by purchasing shoes, clothes, etc. Her long-term goal is to save enough money to purchase a home. She wants to be a successful business woman.

He has been practicing mixed farming for five years in Kisii town, western Kenya. He sells his products to the local market. His biggest challenges have been low market prices for his products and poor weather conditions, which affect his production.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

Gulkiya\u2019s husband had to leave to go to Russia because he was offered a much better job. Both of them hope that soon things will be figured out and that they will have a chance to bring the whole family together. \r\n\r\nEvery morning Gulkiya says good bye to her child until the evening, and leaves for work as early as possible. Retailing consumer goods is highly competitive, leading people to come up with new ideas for promoting their products. Every seller has his or her own techniques ranging from allowing customers to bargain to making gifts to customers. Gulkiya believes in a saying \u201cthe early bird catches the worm\u201d and tries to open up early to attract early customers wandering in a market. Gulkiya faces severe competition, so she does her best to stand out from the crowd. \r\n\r\nGulkiya's parents operated the business throughout their whole life. They gave Gulkiya the business ten years ago when. By watching her parents serve customers, Gulkiya already knew the successful techniques of retail. Ten years of hard work has brought its fruits. Gulkiya made a gift to her husband. She bought an automobile that he was dreaming of for a very long time. At this moment the business generates a monthly income of 7,000 soms for Gulkiya. She plans to spend the requested loan on buying more consumer goods. Over the next months she expects to have high demand and truly believes she will be repay the loan on time and without any violations.\r\n      \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She currently works in a shop in Kimironko district. She takes care of two relatives who are 8 to 20 years old. She runs a well-organized small store which sells bananas. She has been operating it successfully for three years and her shop is open from 7am until 7pm every day.  \r\n\r\nDenise is the leader of this group, called \"Ubumwe\" in the local language, which means \"reconciliation\". The group consists of two men and five women. Denise is the second person on the left, raising her hand.\r\n\r\nThe group has requested a loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company, to purchase more bananas for their market, so they can provide better service to their customers.

She lives in her own house and what she would like most is to earn a good living so that she can give her future family financial stability.  \r\n\r\nShe started learning business strategies at a young age since she worked for her parents at their sales stand.  With the education they gave her and some savings she decided to become independent and forge ahead alone in the business sector.  Today she has her own business.  She buys products from farmers in the jungle such as coffee, cocoa, achiote [the natural pigment annatto is derived from this shrub], corn and palillo [a condiment].  She also has the help of 2 workers who are responsible for packing and weighing each product, thus allowing her to drive her car around to the various communities in search of products.  When she has a good quantity stored she sells it to middlemen who pay her a large percentage for each kilogram of product.  Her business is very profitable because apart from what she sells the middlemen give her incentives every year.  The rainy season and the landslides on the roads are a challenge because they block the roads and make delivery of the products difficult.  Her plans for the future are to continue working with the same zeal that is characteristic of her.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is capable of making her payments on time since she wants to be able to access more credit in the future.  The loan she is requesting will give her capital to buy coffee, cocoa, corn and achiote from farmers.

This capable and enterprising man generates an income as an artisan, an occupation he started when he was 18 and still practices today. His primary knitting projects include ponchos and blankets known as \"gachacatas\". They are use to carry children on one's back. Thanks to his dedication and creativity his knitting has generated large orders from buyers of different cities in the country. They constantly visit his workshop to make purchases. His considerable profits have permitted him to save money and in only three years' time he was able to open his own dispensary. He sells fuel to cars that come to his locality. He says that it is going very well because there are no gas stations in the region and several drivers visit him constantly. He is thankful for his wife's support because she takes care of their flock of 50 sheep. He is a member of the communal bank named \"Telarmachay\" and it is his fourth loan with MPF (Kiva Field Partner). He is happy with the work he has accomplished during this time. \"I have learned to save money and to focus\", he affirms. For this reason he promises to be on time with his loan payments. On receiving his support, Justo will invest the funds he requests in the purchase of several barrels of fuels to support his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":881054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase several barrels of fuel.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-28T12:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3047,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400666}],"funded_date":"2011-10-12T23:50:29Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":344915,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is a 35-year-old, hardworking woman.

Untuk itulah Komang berusaha dengan memelihara babi di rumahnya dan masuk anggota kelompok ternak Kembang Mekar. Dengan modal sendiri serta pinjaman dari DINARI, Komang mampu membeli 3 ekor induk babi dimana setelah 6 bulan memelihara induk babi tersebut menghasilkan masing-masing 5-6 ekor anak babi. Setelah dijual keuntungan yang diperoleh setelah dipotong biaya pakannya mencapai Rp. 1.500.000,- dalam kurun waktu 6 bulan. Melihat hasil yang bagus ini, Komang melanjutkan ke pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan juga dan rencananya akan dibelikan pakan yang lebih berkualitas bagi 3 ekor induk babinya tersebut sehingga anak-anak babi yang dihasilkan akan bertambah banyak dan berkualitas bagus. Program pinjaman ke peternak babi dari DINARI dengan pelunasan pinjaman pada akhir periode di bulan ke 6 ini dirasakan sangat menolong Komang Wenti untuk mengembangkan usahanya dan hasilnya sangat membantu Komang untuk menyekolahkan anak-anaknya.","en":"Komang Wenti needs to afford tuition for her 3 daughters, two are in school already.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and its manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Sabino is 38 years old, married and has two children who live at home. For him, working the land is an art and he cultivates it with great care. Before starting his agricultural labours he first observes the development of his plants, where he removes any bad ones that could threaten the rest, thereby trying to prevent the spread of pests in advance. His cultivation process is first to plant potatoes with an application of fertilizer, then he harvests them, and follows this by sowing peas. In this way he is able to avoid having to use fertilizer so the planting of peas results in a small investment. And market prices are generally stable, without affecting his capital investment. In this way, he tries to reap all of the benefits from each one of his farms with these two products. His greatest difficulty is that he does not own the land himself. Sabino participates in all the payment meetings. He is the funny man and his peers enjoy his jokes. This is his 7th loan and throughout all this time he has worked responsibly on every one of his quotas.

They have known each other for a long time and trust each other very much. \r\n\r\nJohana is a 24-year-old young woman who is single and the mother of two children who are three and one.  She provides for her children through her work. She works at buying and selling clothes as a vendor. She dreams of buying land to build her own house, since she currently lives with her mother, and would like to grow her business and provide her children with a good education. \r\n\r\nWith the loans obtained, she states that she has been able to capitalize and increase sales. She is the coordinator of the group and encourages the group to be punctual and to comply with payments. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Gait\u00e1n works at selling various kinds of footwear, including women's sandals, men's and children's shoes. She sells as a vendor in Masaya and in the market. She buys her products in the shoemaker shops where she gets good prices when she buys them wholesale.

She dreams of improving her house to give her more security. She has a young son who is two.\r\n\r\nMartha Lorena F. H. also works at selling clothes and shoes, combining two types of products.

She is 23 years old. Irene is the group leader of a five member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Irene Vergaras's Group.\r\n\r\nIrene is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Irene owns a general store which sells a variety of different products in the local community. Irene has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Irene joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Irene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Irene is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Primitiva's main job is buying and selling small animals, like pigs, hens, lambs, and guinea pigs, which she feeds and fattens up to later resell in the central market in the city of Tarma. However, a year ago, she bought an automobile for providing public transportation, covering the Palcamayo and Tarma routes. With this business, Primitiva says she has had very good results. There is little access to the villages that are far from town, where most of the residents have to get to the city to buy supplies and groceries, trade their crops and do other standalone jobs. Therefore, she is thinking of acquiring another automobile, with which she could make greater profits and meet the demand due to lack of mobility. This is her second loan with MFP, and as a new member of her communal bank, she is happy to be able to share her success with the other members. The amount she is requesting, together with the money she has saved, will be enough to buy a new automobile, which she plans to use to meet the demand for public transportation in the surrounding areas far from the city of Tarma."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":667409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"It will complete the amount needed to buy an automobile to be used for public transportation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-17T03:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1056.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349923}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T01:42:13Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel McRoberts","image":602385}},{"id":262950,"name":"Balinaki Development Group-Jinja","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty N. is 32 years old, married, and has five children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as funds for her business operation so that she can continue to save up for the future, maintain good health and a successful business. Rosa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It is near the towns of Soledad, Sabanagrande, and Santo Tom\u00e1s.  The area has a special social composition since its inhabitants are a mix of people from all over the country that come to work independently at their business, or in the Malambo Industrial Park (PIMSA).  This is a private industrial area with a complete infrastructure of services designed to reduce costs for the businesses located there, and guarantee the availability of sufficient labor to the businesses in the area.\r\n\r\nJosefa has two children who are 22 and 12 years old.  She hopes that they will be successful people, and they are her motivation in life.  Five years ago, Josefa worked at a store and became unemployed.  With her settlement, she purchased a display case, dressmaking supplies, and outfitted a room in her house to take advantage of the strategic potential of her neighborhood.  Her business was growing every day and with that, her profits grew, which allowed her to purchase more display cases.  Later she bought two die-cut machines with 40 stencils and offered die-cut services and covered buttons.  She also bought two display stands for tapes and threads to sell.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is Josefa's first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization that introduced her to the benefits of Kiva loans.  For this reason, she is applying for a loan to purchase shoes and stationary so that she can diversify her offerings.  Her goal is to improve her store to give it a better image, support her children's university studies, and fulfill her personal dream of having a well known business.  While this happens, she manages a cycle of 93.58 days, an inventory rotation of 93 days, and her profitability is 31%.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":840419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase shoes and stationary to diversify her business.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-14T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77419},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81638},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83202},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84797},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":86422},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":88079},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89767},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91487},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93241},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95028},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96849},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102071}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.22,"local_amount":77419,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80087.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803717},{"amount":47.69,"local_amount":81638,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84451.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614795},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":83202,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86069.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568747},{"amount":49.53,"local_amount":84797,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87719.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780077},{"amount":50.48,"local_amount":86422,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":89400.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188468},{"amount":51.45,"local_amount":88079,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91114.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324686},{"amount":332.03,"local_amount":568443,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":588033.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038746}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T18:40:48Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":328522,"name":"Semi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Semi is a 23-year-old single lady who lives with her parents in a modest house.

He has worked in rice production since he was young, after learning from his father. He bought his land about 15 years ago. He depends on his rice production to feed and educate his two children who are 6 and 7 years old. He lives with his wife, children, his father and a sister. They all work together in the fields in order to cultivate rice. He will use the loan to invest in seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. He hopes he can improve his home and save for the future of his children. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-14T01:51:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luiciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-01T08:11:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21434},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:44:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31821},{"amount":815,"local_amount":815,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:38:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107750},{"amount":11,"local_amount":11,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T17:19:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140958},{"amount":77,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T19:41:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211039}],"funded_date":"2007-04-17T08:11:45Z","paid_date":"2008-05-15T19:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12185,"name":"Banovsha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"V.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

In the future, she wishes to establish her juice store in a bigger, more centrally located space.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":303306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fruit and accessories for selling her juices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn - San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-04-19T16:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexa Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":336.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36007176},{"amount":108.44,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":336.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590858},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985122},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.32,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":336.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205461},{"amount":108.45,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":336.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634680},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":336.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87073928}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T18:06:55Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T22:44:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":106417,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna A.

This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to purchase additional pigs and feed so that she can continue to saving for the future.

Cabunga-an, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. Primitiva is the group leader of this three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group members if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is Primitiva E.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva is married to Lerio E., a motor cab driver. They are blessed with five adult children, two of whom are married.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Primitiva decided to engage in a micro-business operating a sari-sari (variety) store in addition to doing some farming activity. For a year, she has been able to maintain this business activity and is now earning an average net income of not less than P3,500 a month, which is very helpful to her family.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva joined the Cooperative in 2009.  She is an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor.  Primitiva is requesting a loan in the amount of P10,000 for her 4th loan from PMPC. Part of this loan will be used to purchase commercial fertilizers and the remaining amount will be used for motor maintenance.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 \r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for Primitiva\u2019s family, to meet their basic needs, to repay loans from PMPC, and to use for possible business expansion. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans:  In a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.

She is single and lives with her parents and two younger bothers, ages 13 and 6.  They live in their own home.  Ziosi sells different styles of top quality men's clothing, which an aunt of hers in Lima sends every two weeks.  Most of her customers are friends and acquaintances and she sells on a cash or 10-day credit basis.  She also brings in clothing on an order basis and has been in business for two years.  She handles the selling aspect of business on her own.  What she likes best is having her own income to pay for her education and sometimes help her parents wtih household expenses, as well has having free time to study.  What she likes least is the lack of payment punctuality on the credit she gives some customers, but this has not interfered with her loan payment commitment.  She feels her business is profitable because she has a regular customer base comprised of colleagues, friends and relatives.  In the future she wants to open a clothing store in downtown Pucallpa.  This is her first loan through the MFP institution and she is grateful for the opportunity to grow her business.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time so she can have access to more loans.

This is an average family from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, Mahfuza is a unique entrepreneur. She has been selling kids' clothing in the central city market for about 2 years, running her own small venture successfully. The secret of her success is simple: she tries to not only let her customers know the benefits of her products \u2013 she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is at with her venture. <P>\r\n\r\nMahfuza is seeking a loan of 3400 Somoni to re-stock the merchandise in her store for the winter season. We believe that Mahfuza\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing her customers will determine her further success and encourage new customers to buy from her. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 37 years old. Lerma is the group leader of an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lerma M.'s Group.\r\n<p>\r\nLerma is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Lerma owns & operates a furniture making business. The main source of income for the business comes from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Lerma has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Lerma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lerma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase wood for her furniture business. Lerma is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials for her furniture making business, such as wood and varnish. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Lerma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":507089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials for furniture making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cabaritan, San Manuel, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lerma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marites","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geronima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

YANACOTO\r\n\r\nMember of ALCOM: \"SANTA ROSA OF YANACOTO\u201d whose members are progressive and hardworking with their own businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nCecilia began working since childhood with her mother who sold natural medicine in her homeland Hu\u00e1nuco. She married at the young age of 14 and began a grocery business. A few years later, with all she had learned, she decided to sell medicine, natural meiecine, and started applying her mother's knowledge of curing certain ailments such as respiratory tract diseases, muscle pain, and mild infections. At the same time she sold clothes and polos and it was then that she decided to move to Lima. This time she had to recommend herself since it was a new place. There was no competition for her business so she was able to implement more in merchandise with the loans she received from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD.  With the sales she was then able to have her own stand in a shopping center where her sales are very profitable. The secret is that besides Cecilia being a specialist in knowing every plant's healing property, she serves her community by helping the elders and does not charge them for remedies she prepares. This job helped her grow since she attended talks and conferences she was invited to. She had the opportunity to travel to Ecuador and the people she met there where medical therapists who enhanced her understanding. In turn, she was able to share with the medical specialists the healing  discoveries she maD. while treating her patients. Not only was she able to buy the land she owns and lives on, with this job she was also able to build it, acquire artifacts, and pay for her children's education. Many of her patients are professionals (lawyers, politicians, nurses, and doctors) and locals who are grateful for Cecilia being able to cure many of their diseases such as cancer, tumors, cysts, and myomas; but only when a surgical intervention is not necessary. If they do need surgery she tells her patients they should have it since she verifies it through x-rays and ultra sound scanning. She thanks God for having guided her to this path of helping people with much love through her knowledge. Her goal is to travel with medics in the United States so they can learn about and spread this form of healing.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she requests will be used to buy more syrups, herbs, and other natural healing medications.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":598084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy more syrups, herbs, and other natural healing medications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-14T15:58:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacia Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benito Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390873},{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529153},{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665261},{"amount":760,"local_amount":2100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408517}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T12:02:16Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Garza","image":688224}},{"id":234293,"name":"Konooweka Zibba  Women's Group-Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In business, one has to take both the rough and the smooth along the way as he or she operates.

Harriet is a strong willed woman with a fun loving disposition. She is a happily married mother of 5 kids who all attend good schools in and around Ziba. To take root in this business she was helped by a close friend who gave her not only financial support but also confidence building advice on how to run a business.

She sells fish and seafood, both fresh and dried. She has her stand on a street named Avenida D. Comercio in San Francisco Gotera. She is married and she lives together with her husband and their three children: Mario Francisco, 22 years old; Douglas Armando, 17 years old; and, Carlos Daniel, 14 years old. \r\n\r\nShe started out with her sister as a business partner but now she works only with her family.  She purchases the fresh fish in the very early morning hours in San Miguel and by 8am she is ready to start selling in Gotera. She has more than 20 years' experience in the business and it has been her only source of income used to support and educate her children. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to revitalize her seafood business and now especially that the day of the dead approaches and many people buy flowers, she wants to take advantage of the season and sell in this time. She plans to invest 50% of the funds on each one of her two businesses. This investment will help her generate more earnings to be used to supplement the family economy. The only risk has to sell the fresh seafood quickly to avoid losing freshness over several days. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to garner enough profit to send her kids to school, to help them have a career. She will also use her profits to repay this loan, and to save money enough to build her own home one day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":626890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Hamidou Ousmane D. never had the chance to progress in his studies, so he quickly joined the business of selling cellular phones and their accessories (cases, batteries, chargers, head-sets, etc.), and has been doing so for ten years.
