Her partner and her decided to improve their financial situation by setting up a business. Her partner had become unemployed and so did not have any source of income for the family. This is how they came to sell metals, cardboard, plastics; with a little capital and a small storeroom to keep their recycled material.\r\n\r\nWith this business things started to go well for them as they invested part of their earnings back into the business. Now their micro-business grows more everyday and they need a constant working capital in order to buy materials.

SeNA is a state organization for educational development for technical and technological careers.  For this reason, they do not just sell handicrafts from their own culture, but also those from other regions of the country.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for this Kiva loan because he is preparing a good inventory of hammocks, bags, and backpacks.  The loan will allow him to purchase supplies in greater volume, buying yarn for hammocks, a packet of fine yarn for bags and backpacks, and also skeins of agave fiber.  With this he will be able to make ten hammocks and fifty bags, and use the rest for the backpacks.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment lies in the fact that he will not need to purchase products as other suppliers do, which normally happens due to growing sales, but he will have a supply of stock to offer for sale.  His experience resides in knowing how to sell and have in stock what his customers

Chill\u00e1n es conocida como \u201cCuna de la Patria\u201d o \u201cTierra de Artistas\u201d, debido a que en la ciudad han nacido destacados personajes de la historia de Chile, como por ejemplo el conocido pianista Claudio Arrau.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cEsperanza\u201d and it has 18 entrepreneurs who carry out a variety of lines of work among which are clothes sales, running an Internet caf\u00e9 (a public place with access to the Internet), bookstore, fast food production, pastry shop and clothes making, among others; all are from the city of Chill\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nMaribel is a member of the communal bank who is seated in the first row in the photo first from left to right; her hair is dark brown and she\u2019s wearing brown pants.  She runs a grocery and beverage shop.  She comments that she\u2019s had this business for the last five months.  She works full time since she works from 8am until 10pm, Monday to Sunday.  She must follow this schedule because there is no other store for 3 kilometers and customer demand is high, a situation she notes optimistically because she has no competition.  She has recently also added baking and selling bread.  She buys her merchandise in wholesale supermarkets and from snack distributors.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy an electric, refrigerated display case to store her products to increase clientele and thus her income.  Her goals are to expand her store to start her activities cycle since she now only has a temporary sales permit.  She will also buy a kneader to make bread making easier.\r\n\r\nMaribel lives with her husband and two children who are 6 years and one year and seven months old.  Her dream at a personal level is to obtain a house of her own since she currently lives in a borrowed house and lot.  \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the economic support Fondo Esperanza has granted her.  Besides, she feels very comfortable in the meetings they have because she shares experiences with other merchant members and also learns new administration strategies.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in south-central Chile.  Its name means \u201cSeat of the Sun\u201d in Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche indigenous peoples.  Chill\u00e1n is also known as the \u201cBirthplace of the Nation\u201d or \u201cLand of Artists\u201d because outstanding personages in Chile\u2019s history were born here like the well-known pianist, Claudio Arrau, for example.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1022893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Su trabajo es cansador pues est\u00e1 en la atenci\u00f3n de su negocio todo el d\u00eda desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche, en algunas horas la madre le reemplaza mientras Gustavo asiste a   sus clases ya que trabaja y estudia. Entre sus metas esta estudiar una carrera profesional y de esa manera tener dos fuentes de ingreso para poder tener un mejor nivel de vida.","en":"Gustavo is a modest young man who decided to start his own photocopy business in order to earn his own money and become independent. Thanks to this business, he has been able to lift one more responsibility off his parents' shoulders, and he can help out with the household expenses. He has been in business for 3 years. He started out thanks to the support of his aunt, who provided him with his work tool, the photocopier, which she sold to him on credit. He was able to pay the debt with the money he earned from the copy services. Gustavo views his work tool with pride because it is one of his assets. He now aspires to expand his small business, which is why he will ultimately purchase another machine with this loan. His work is exhausting because he opens from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening. His mother takes his place for a few hours so that he can attend school since he works and studies. One of his goals is to earn a degree and obtain two sources of income, thus affording him a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1023056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

There, she makes handicrafts for a living, something that she learned through family tradition but perfected via training from SENA (National Learning Service), which is an organization run by the state for the development of technical jobs. Because of this, she knows about handicrafts from not only her own culture, but also from other regions of the country. She is a very studious person who also learned about cosmetology and opened up a beauty salon. She also opened a game room and learned how to make beauty products herself. From all her proactive fronts, she is generating income, applying the sales techniques she knows how to employ in each of her businesses. For this reason, she has been gaining customers in all her ventures, and business grows ever day. Her goal of business expansion is endless, which is why she prepares herself with the training that helps her add value to her daily tasks. Her future goal is to perfect her stylist skills and to have a big beauty product business in which she will produce the goods herself. She is currently requesting her first loan through Kiva, and this is the second loan she requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, she will purchase thread to make bags, backpacks, and hammocks, video games, and supplies to make beauty products.

She learned the work of preparing and managing food when she worked as an employee in the restaurant that her mother had in the public market.  That same restaurant was given to Nilda by her mother because her mom began to have health problems.  With her restaurant she has had many challenges that she has had to face, like the times when the metro stop was under construction and her sales went down.  For that reason she had to restructure and locate the business in her own home.  Currently her business is growing and each day her customer base increases.  With her earnings she supports the family expenses along with her husband who is an independent stationary contractor.  Her Kiva credit is the first financing that she has received through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, a Kiva field partner.  With the loan she will purchase tables, plastic chairs, fans, and a freezer.  This infrastructure will help her keep her customers comfortable so that they will return and become faithful clients.  Her goal is to have sufficient capital from permanent work to be able to support her business and in the future buy her own home.

","en":"Duverlys is 34 years old and lives with her husband and their three children, who range in age from 10 to 12.  Her business experience began 6 years ago when she and her mother opened a store that sold groceries and other basic necessities.  However, Duverlys and her family later had to leave their home, since they were displaced and had to go to live with her sister.  She restarted her business 7 months ago, though with only a few basic staple items.  By working persistently she has managed to make some progress, but her biggest challenge is working capital, since she doesn\u2019t have enough for her growth plans.  She also needs more money so she can help her husband with the household expenses; he works farming a parcel of land and raising livestock.  That is why Duverlys has decided to take out a loan.

Her husband was born in the municipality of Sabanagrande in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico where she is well known for her informal way of interacting with those she knows. Because of this, when she decided to offer her services to the public four years ago, she did it in the municipality where she's from and things have gone well for her. Nowadays she lives very near to the sea, scenery which inspires her with creativity hand in hand with her husband and their two children that are between the ages of 9 and 10 years old. The services she mainly offers are to mend dresses, dress shirts, and female skirts, and to a lesser extent makes a living making garments. Her plans include making her shop bigger, adding sewing machines, and hiring an employee that will support its growth. Currently her work capital is not enough to have this goal succeed and for this reason she turned to a Kiva loan. Also, this is the first financing she has done with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this she will buy a sewing machine and an overlock sewing machine. She plans to offer more effective and better quality service to her customers with these.

Pasturing takes 80% of Mushviq's time. He usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for five to six months, and then resells them for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar.

Abel has already started along that path and therefore decided to apply to INTEGRAL for a loan that will enable him to purchase recycled plastic materials and bags wholesale, etc. He hopes that in this way he will be able to provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1024854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-15T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-14T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":49.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.1,"local_amount":70.1,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573651},{"amount":36.92,"local_amount":36.92,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319231},{"amount":37.62,"local_amount":37.62,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":37.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049528},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":39.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":39.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521165},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":40.47,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":40.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329797},{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":41.97,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":41.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349624},{"amount":43.8,"local_amount":43.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315320991},{"amount":189.68,"local_amount":189.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":189.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929574}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T16:51:07Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:43:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":401467,"name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel de Jes\u00fas de cuarenta a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1era de vida y su hijo.

This city is noted for its hot climate, its beautiful beaches, its fishing and its cuisine including 'chupe de camarones' (shrimp chowder).
