Anarkul does animal husbandry as a source of income for her family. She started her business in 1990 with the sum of 3,000 som (KGS) which now brings her around 10,000 som a month from the sale of milk and dairy products. Thanks to her hard work Anarkul's livestock headcount now has two milk cows, two calves as well as 4,20 hectares of land which she cultivates with beets, potato and barley. With the goal to further develop her business Anarkul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy livestock. She plans to invest the profit from the loan in the reconstruction of the roof of her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1036050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He studied through eighth grade but stopped due to his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and also supports his parents, who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left Manjacze for Maputo, which is in the district of Boane, in search of a job.  He has been a Bananalandia driver for more than 8 years.  He makes 4,700 meticals a month that he puts towards his home's expenses.  He also saves some in his bank account at the BIM bank.\r\n\r\nHe has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend that is also a client of the institution.  This is his third loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 20,000 meticals, which he will invest in construction materials for his home (sand, cement, iron, rock, etc.).  His first two loans were for 10,000 meticals each, and they also went towards his home.\r\n\r\nHe promises to make his payments on time.  In the future, he wants to finish his home and buy a vehicle, for which he is planning on requesting more loans from

In the mornings she tends to the household chores and also watches over her small store. She has had the store for a year and a half; it is a source of income which allows her to contribute to her family's expenses. With the joint effort of her and her husband, they have been able to move forward and provide an education to their children who are currently both studying. They were also able to buy land in which they hope to build a house on in the future. With this loan she plans to invest in improvements to the property where her store is located. Like Leandra, each member of the group has their own unique story, but one thing they all have in common is their enthusiasm and desire to get ahead for the good of one another and for their families.

","en":"Mukadaskhan is 37 years old, married, and raising three children, of which the youngest one is in kindergarten. Mukadaskhan is a seamstress by education, which helped her when she in 2008, in search of a source of income for her family, started sewing her own products for selling. \r\n\r\nIn the course of time, Mukadaskhan expanded the range of products, also selling things by purchasing finished products of children's clothing and lingerie. Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, Mukadaskhan was able to develop her business to a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nToday the assortment of products is not abundant, and for this reason, Mukadaskhan turned to the company \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to expand the range of spring clothing. Mukadaskhan plans to use part of the income to repair her apartment and the rest to develop her business"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1035822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to broaden the assortment of spring clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T00:10:05Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukadaskhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5891},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5969},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6113},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6261},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6412},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6567},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6726},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6888},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7055},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7225},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7400},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7493}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":127.02,"local_amount":5891,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5910.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816238},{"amount":128.71,"local_amount":5969,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5988.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072283},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":6113,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6133.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370852},{"amount":1337.46,"local_amount":62027,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62233.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285519}],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T18:25:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:58:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":402927,"name":"Ma.corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma.

She started her business in 1991 with 1,000 som (KGS) which now brings her around 8,000 som a month from the sale of milk and dairy products.

Wendy es una joven muy carism\u00e1tica, trabajadora y sobre todo emprendedora. Ella se dedica al cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos principalmente Ma\u00edz y frijoles que son los cultivos que m\u00e1s se dan en su zona. Esto es uno de sus principales fuentes de ingresos puesto que lo que gana su esposo en transporte no alcanza a cubrir las necesidades del hogar que  cada d\u00eda son mayores. Wendy ha trabajado desde hace mucho tiempo en esta actividad, la cual le ha dado muy buenos resultados. Muchas personas buscan a Wendy para solicitarle ma\u00edz o frijoles ya que ella los vende a muy buenos precios y es muy accesible con los pagos.  Tiene la duda de c\u00f3mo hacer para seguir invirtiendo en este negocio en el futuro puesto que no cuenta con los recursos necesarios para invertir en los insumos y en el alquiler de la tierra para seguir operando.  Esto la ha llevado a tomar la decisi\u00f3n de solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en la compra de: abonos, semilla de ma\u00edz, semilla de arroz, venenos para las plagas y alquilar de mayor cantidad de tierra para la siembra. de tal forma que pueda seguir teniendo los ingresos que hasta el momento ha recibido y que le han servido mucho para llevar el pan de cada d\u00eda a su hogar. Espera mejorar su nivel de ventas as\u00ed como su nivel de ingresos que le permitan tener acceso a mejores condiciones de vida tanto para ella como para su familia. \n","en":"Wendy Beatriz, 23 years old, lives in her own home with her partner, who works in the transport service. Wendy is a charismatic, hard-working and, above all, entrepreneurial young woman. She works in agriculture, growing mainly dry grains such as corn and beans, which are in high demand in her area. This is one of her main sources of income as her partner's wage does not cover the continually increasing expenses of running their home. Wendy has been doing this type of work for a long time, and she has achieved good results from it. Many people come to buy their corn or beans from Wendy because she sells them at a good, affordable price. She is concerned about how to continue investing in her business in the future as she does not have the necessary resources to invest in raw materials and the rent payable on the land she uses for planting.

She is married and has three children age 17, 13 and 2. She has no additional dependents.  \r\n\r\nIn 1992, Memuna established her Africana dress business. She began her business because just after she concluded her national primary school education, she lost her father and by then her mother was seriously sick so that she could neither look after her nor support her education. So therefore, she decided to assist neighbors in doing business with the intention that somebody would take care of her schooling, but unfortunately, that did not happen.\r\n\r\nSo she finally made up her mind to continue business and started to raise funds and started her own business. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Memuna requires a loan in order to buy 10 cartons of ladies' slippers @ SLL 250,000 and five dozen ladies' trousers @ SLL 420,000. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 900,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Memuna plans to rent a shop at the center of town and also hopes to see her children educated to higher levels. She is hard-working and very grateful.

She is a farmer and also buys and sells scrap metal, plastic, and aluminum. Since she has been farming for almost 10 years, she is very experienced and well known in the area where she lives. She is an incredible woman: hardworking, dedicated, and above all, charismatic. Her dream is to give her family the best that she can.\r\n\r\nAll this has made her think about the possibility of investing more in her business through a loan. Evaluating the situation has led her to the conclusion that she needs a loan to be able to invest in her business. Therefore, she came to INTEGRAL to ask for this investment loan to buy basic agricultural inputs (manure, poisons, seed, etc.), as she needs them to continue working the land and supporting herself and her family. She is fully confident that this will happen.

She is married and raising three children.  Anarkul was born in 1955 into a simple family with many children.  Her father was a paramedic, and mother was a seamstress.  Being the oldest in the family, Anarkul helped her parents with the household since childhood and took care of her six brothers and sisters.  She graduated from the Orlovskaya secondary school in her native village and followed her father's footsteps by going to a medical college in Bishkek after school.  In 1975, after finishing college, she got a job as a nurse at the Sokulukskaya district hospital.  This same year, Anarkul got married and gave birth to a daughter and son.  In 1978, Anarkul and her husband moved to the Alekseevka village (Jayl district, Chuyskaya region), where they bought a plot of land.  Anarkul got a job as a paramedic at the Alekseevka paramedic-ambulatory site, and her husband got a job as a leading specialist at the Jayl district prosecutor's office.  In 1980, Anarkul got a job as a teacher at the Karabalta medical college, and gave birth to her youngest daughter in 1986.  During the years of perestroika, Anarkul and her husband started to build a large house.  Because the money lost its value, their salaries were not enough to cover even regular food.  This is why Anarkul had to go a market, where she resold fruits and vegetables.  Thanks to their hard work, persistence and mutual support, Anarkul and her husband built a good, large house, raised and educated their children.  In 2002, Anarkul received a title of \"Excellent Healthcare Professional.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, Anarkul works as a teacher at the Karablta medical college and is also involved in animal husbandry.  Having started this business with an amount of 30,000 som, Anarkul was able to grow her business to have a monthly profit of 15,000 som.  At the present time, her business has one heifer and ten sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkul requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy five heads of bulls.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1040738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

When she started as a merchant 20 years ago she did so by selling beer.\r\n\t\r\nDue to health problems she later changed her business and started to sell all types of merchandise.  It was a small and very domestic market that gave her orders that she needed to fill.  However, little by little she was setting up a sales location in her own house.  She did so in order to sell items like pencils, cardboard, paper, women\u2019s accessories, and cologne, etc. that the neighbors need all of the time.  The business has gone very well for her.  She has managed to get her children ahead and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the 21st loan she has with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

They are all married and use their income to cover certain expenses relative to food, health, or their children's schooling. \r\n\r\nThe president of the group (who is raising her hand) is the mother of two children.

This is a small community and its residents are very kind to visitors.\r\n\r\nSantos would like to invest in his business.  In particular, he would like to buy urea and supplies to maintain his banana production.  This will make him better income and so he will enjoy better living conditions within his community.  For this reason, he has decided to request a loan for 1,500 soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nThe area in which Santos lives is ideal for this type of business and so the local people work producing bananas and beans.  For this reason, the risk of investing in their plots of land is less and they make good profits.\r\n\r\nSantos' main goal is to sell his produce for a good price and to attract more potential customers.  In  order to achieve this he works as hard as he can and, above all, he works very responsibly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1029907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy urea and fertilizers for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Morrop\u00f3n - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1508,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":135.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.6,"local_amount":103.85,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":105.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621404},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":108.85,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":110.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332774},{"amount":86.57,"local_amount":227.05,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":231.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423548},{"amount":45.65,"local_amount":119.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":122.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373795},{"amount":95.19,"local_amount":249.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":254.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385043},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":130.1,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":132.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368641},{"amount":51.55,"local_amount":135.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":137.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977701},{"amount":53.44,"local_amount":140.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":142.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506607},{"amount":111.89,"local_amount":293.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":299.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058570}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T13:43:55Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":403451,"name":"Hira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hira works hard to support her family.

She asked for her loan to buy sugar, oil, eggs, soap, soft-drinks and cookies to stock her store.  She started the business two years ago due to the lack of economic resources since her husband\u2019s salary was insufficient.  She started out selling candy and now has grown into a grocery store.  Her business is important because it helps her cover her daughters\u2019 school expenses.  She enjoys running her own business, seeing how much comes in and how much goes out.  She divides her profits in her daughters\u2019 expenses, in the house and to reinvest.  She feels proud of having a source of income to help her daughters with their school expenses.\r\n\r\nHer hopes and dreams are to turn her store into a mini supermarket and that her daughters become successful, studious career women.  She is happy with this loan because of the opportunity for business growth and to administer it properly.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group would like to say this to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:

She tells us that she started up her business because she needed to have an additional source of income that would allow her to get ahead with her family.  She also works as a farmer, but this activity does not provide a steady income.\r\n\r\nHer business is useful for the neighbors in the area, and so she wants to expand it to provide better service by stocking it with more merchandise.

The people belonging to the communal bank work raising animals, in agriculture, and in business. The female members are women who work in different economic activities, the very ones that allow them to improve their household finances. These women uphold the culture and traditions of their towns.\r\n\r\nOne of the female members of this group is Karina, who is 23 years old. She is married and has a 4-year-old daughter with her husband. Her husband works in construction as a mason. They don't have their own house so they live with her mother, but in an independent manner.\r\n\r\nKarina has been working in business for 5 years. She sells all kinds of clothing on market days. She has also had a food store for 2 years, where she works from Sunday to Sunday from 6 in the morning to 10 at night.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank finds itself in its second loan cycle, and she will invest the new loan in buying products which are basic necessities to supply her store. Her goal is to have her own house.\r\n \r\nThe small photograph is of a member who was unable to be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":1023260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products that are basic necessities.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":3975,"lender_count":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rebertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3960,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034151},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646232},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321312},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208912},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335225},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391072}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T06:54:38Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":403488,"name":"Analyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analyn works hard to support her family.

Marina is a 37-year-old single mother of three children, two girls and a boy. Her youngest daughter is in high school, and the eldest two are adults and no longer in school due to the fact she was a very young mother. Marina has a grocery store, and she is requesting the loan to purchase milk, oil, ham, beans, rice, sugar, detergents, eggs, beverages, chips and cookies. She started the business 10 years ago when she was offered to rent a store front, and she accepted. Her business is important because it pays the bills, like electric, gas and water services. She enjoys when customers purchase her products and she feels proud of having a store where someone can come when they need something or when there's an emergency.

He has good personal and professional references. He lives in his own home with his family in Morrop\u00f3n, about four hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the department of Lambayeque. The community is small and the people are very friendly to visitors. Alejandro has made a living in farming and raising and selling small animals for the past five years. He wants to invest in his business. Specifically, he wants to purchase corn, to fix his corrals and to maintain his bean crops. In this way he can increase his profits, provide for his family and improve their quality of life. This is why he is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa. It is a good market for raising and selling animals since the majority of the population works in this type of business and everyone looks out for each other. This encourages livestock raisers to invest in the area and receive short-term profits. Alejandro takes a lot of responsibility in his work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":742934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn, fix his corrals and maintain his bean crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Matanza - Morrop\u00f3n - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2010,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":160.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":180.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":186.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.35,"local_amount":283.6,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":292.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621403},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":149.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":154.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332773},{"amount":58.95,"local_amount":152.9,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":157.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316958},{"amount":61.52,"local_amount":159.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":164.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373794},{"amount":61.92,"local_amount":160.6,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":165.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385042},{"amount":66.44,"local_amount":172.3,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":177.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368640},{"amount":66.87,"local_amount":173.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":178.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977700},{"amount":69.5,"local_amount":180.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":185.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114928},{"amount":72.05,"local_amount":186.85,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":192.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506606},{"amount":150.64,"local_amount":390.7,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":402.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058569}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T14:29:44Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":403501,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa works hard to support her family.

expand their businesses.\r\nThey come from a small village called El Cerro de la Esperanza. Going into the village there are a lot of papaya gardens and mango trees. Most of the men in Cerro de la Esperanza sow corn and papayas, and the women sell chicken, tamales and food.\r\nOne of the group members is Rosario, a hardworking and cheerful lady who has been selling chicken, cheese and bread for a year and a half.\r\nDo\u00f1a Chayo, as she is known to her fellow group members, tells us how she got her three businesses started and made them grow on a daily basis.\r\nShe says that at first she started to buy half a box of chicken and go out to sell it on the streets of her village. She saved her profits in order to buy supplies for baking bread, because she has known how to bake bread since she was 15. She was filled with joy to know that it would be another business and that she would get more profits so that she could improve her 7-year-old son Kevin's living conditions.\r\nDo\u00f1a Chayo tells us that on the third day of every week she makes cheese. She very much enjoys curdling the milk and putting salt in the curd so that her cheese gets enough, but not too much salt.\r\nDo\u00f1a Chayo will use the loan to purchase more supplies for baking bread, such as flour, milk, yeast, eggs, baking powder and butter.\r\nShe gives thanks to the Fundaci\u00f3n for the support it has provided so that they can expand their businesses and improve their families' living conditions.\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nOcotlan, who sells antojitos (a typical Mexican snack);\r\nAndrea, who sells perfumes;\r\nGloria, who sells groceries.\r\nThey give thanks to the Fundaci\u00f3n for the help they have been given, because they wish to improve their community with more small businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1023119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies to bake bread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"cerro de laesperanza,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ocotlan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4276.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4519.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4697},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4945.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5157.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5404.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":339.19,"local_amount":4276.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4302.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656732},{"amount":358.42,"local_amount":4519.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4546.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317404},{"amount":372.52,"local_amount":4697,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4725.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418789},{"amount":392.22,"local_amount":4945.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4975.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568393},{"amount":409.05,"local_amount":5157.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5189.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399765},{"amount":428.6,"local_amount":5404.06,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5436.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407521}],"funded_date":"2012-03-22T19:43:41Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":403484,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a married woman with five children.

She enjoys her business very much, since she runs it in her spare time and does not neglect her small children.
