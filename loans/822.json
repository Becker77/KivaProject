Their children are their motivation to work because they want to give them a better life and a better education. Chabela told us that she started to sell house to house, buying a small amount of chickens to sell, but with the help of the foundation she bought more chickens. In the mornings she goes out to sell in the streets of the community. In the afternoons she kills chickens for the customers who will buy in the afternoon in order to prepare the chicken for their dinners. She requested this loan to buy more chickens at wholesale for retail.

Apart from the fact that there are very beautiful places here, many people make their living by doing handicrafts. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Socorro, as she is one of the members of this group. She is 35, and married to Domingo. They have three children, and all three are going to school; one is in first year of high school, another in second year of junior high school, and the youngest is in fourth year of primary school.   \r\n\r\nShe makes and sells bread, empanadas, and rolls, and has been doing this for two years.  She says she decided to start this business, because from a very young age, her mother taught her to make these products. She wanted to put into practice everything she learned. Apart from this, it is a very good source of income, and provides good earnings; it enablies her to secure her children's education and future. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she received, she intends to purchase more ingredients such as flour, eggs, salt, sugar, yeast, milk, rice, cinnamon, bananas, cooking oil, etc. Soco's goal, (that is how she is known in the community) is to make her business grow, as she thinking about building a small shop to set up a bakery in; and also to buy more cooking utensils that she needs. \r\n\r\nThis way she will earn more and better income, enabling her to continue supporting her children with their studies, so that they will have good professions.

There on the warm shore and constant breeze she has her store named after what she feels there - Brisas [breezes] - which are a result of the famous trade winds. She's been running her business since she arrived in this area from Pinchote in the state of Santander; she came seeking better horizons and originally relocated with her family to the city of Santa Marta, where they worked in a store. Ultimately, they wound up in Barranquilla doing the same work, but there they made it a liquor store. With their profits they had an opportunity to buy a store and retrofit it so they could live there with their two children, who are now 19 and 23 years old. Rosario is happy to live in Puerto Colombia because she likes the ways of the coastal people - uncomplicated and happy - but she hasn't forgotten the lush, mountainous countrysides of her homeland. Her goal is to increase her business until she can make it self-service, but she doesn't have enough capital to make her dream a reality. For that reason she is accessing a Kiva loan, her first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundaiton. She will use it to buy provisions to increase her inventory and have a greater variety of products.

She lives alone with her husband and children in the town of Koutiala. Tintina did not go to school; she was a victim of the time when girls did not have the right to go to school, and for this reason she became interested in the business which she learnt from her mother. She has been carrying out this business for more than ten years now and has a good reputation, because \"sounbala\" (a condiment made from pounding and fermenting \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts) is one of the most popular condiments with women, and thus she can make good money from this business. \r\n\r\nIn order to grow her business, Tintina joined the microfinance institution, Soro,Yiriwaso, six years ago. She has participated in six group loans (solidarity loans) which have all been repaid in full, and she is now on her fifth individual loan, the previous four having also been repaid in full. With this loan, she is planning to buy 10 sacks of \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts from stockists in Koutiala and these will be made up into \"sounbala\" and sold on a retail and wholesale basis and for cash in Bamako and Kayes to a customer base made up of women, \r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 120,000FCFA, which she is planning to use to repay interest to Soro and to contribute to improving her family's living conditions.  In this context, Tintina is planning to expand her business in the future.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1044055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy  \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tintina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-22T08:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251944},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449072},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268461},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102918},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624773}],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T17:54:29Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":403604,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty lives in Yei.

She currently works at home, and she has a good reputation because she receives many orders for mats, scarves, and baby clothes each month.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that her customers are well satisfied, Miriam did not hesitate in deciding to join the institution, Soro Yiriwaso, four years ago. After five solidarity loans (group loans) and two individual loans that were all correctly repaid, she is now on her third loan.\r\n\r\nShe stocks up in Koutiala and plans to buy three boxes of wool from retail sellers. She sells her wares for cash or credit in the city of Koutiala to a customer base made up of women.

He gets his supplies in Burkina Faso and Bamako, and carries out his business in the town of Koutiala for a customer base of women and men, for cash; often he sends his sewn fabrics to his brother in France for sale there. He is expecting to make a monthly profit of 150,000FCFA, which he will use to repay his loans and satisfy his family's needs; the balance will be invested in his business.

The boy attends secondary school and the girl upper secondary school. Dolores sells wafers. She applies for this loan to buy flour, bags, paint, oil and ribbons to produce the wafers. She launched her business four years ago. She learned her activity when she was working for a woman who produced wafers. Later her husband applied for a loan to buy ingredients in order to start the business. This activity is important for Dolores, because it gives her the needed financial means to pay for food and tuition fees for her children.\r\n\r\nDolores is proud to provide for herself. Thanks to this well-managed business she was able to put a roof on her house and build her workshop. In her community many people produce wafers. She uses her profit to buy what is lacking at home and save some money with the idea of buying another machine to produce wafers. She dreams and hopes that she can keep on working until her children complete their education, get a job and can provide for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group want to thank Kiva and the microfinance institution Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for their help, and ask them to continue their financial support so that the group members can keep on working in their businesses and enjoy a better life with their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1020292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, bags, paint, oil and ribbons to produce wafers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Amilcingo, Temoac, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio Humberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodemaribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sheyla Berta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Jhanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2242.19,"local_amount":28437.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":28443.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044547},{"amount":1281.25,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":16253.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656745},{"amount":1601.56,"local_amount":20312.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20316.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317417}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T03:38:52Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":403664,"name":"Hulda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hulda is 60 years old and from Kisumu.

She has always had a motivation for business.  When she started she did so with a restaurant together with her brother-in-law.  They also sold cold drinks there.\r\n\r\nShe realized that the greatest volume of their sales was for beer and liquor rather than food.  She then decided to undertake a pub.  Her business partner went to another city, and she returned the capital that her partner had invested.\r\n\r\nShe currently works with help from a very trustworthy friend.  She added the sale of basic needs items along with her drink and liquor sales.  This way the store gets the greatest movement from Monday through Friday, while her pub gets the greatest movement on Fridays to Sundays and holidays.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to convert her store into a warehouse where small businesses and sellers are able to stock up on basic needs products.  This would avoid the expense for transportation.\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy snacks, foodstuffs, drinks, and liquor in greater volume.  This way she will be getting provisions for the holidays and increasing the inventory in her store.  The success of this investment stems from the fact that she gets discounts for buying in volume.  She also wins because the cost of the products she stocks up on, like basic needs items, are always rising.  This favors her income, stabilizes her prices, and allows her to take special care of her customers.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1031098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks, foodstuffs, drinks, and liquor in greater volume.

Having started her business with 20,000 som (KGS), it now brings in around 5,000 som (KGS) a month from sale of meat and milk products. Thanks to Roza's persistant hard work her animals now number 1 milking cow and 10 sheep, and she has a stock of 150 bales of hay. In order to further develop her business, Roza came to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) for purchase of livestock.

","en":"Kulsara is 55 years old. She has brought up four children. In the search of an income source for her family, in 1993 Kulstara started a farming and livestock business. Her business, launched with 10,000 KGS of starting capital, now brings in about 8,000 KGS monthly from the sales of milk and dairy products. Thanks to Kulsara's hard work, her livestock now includes two dairy cows, one calf and 35 sheep. In addition, Kulsara works 1.6 ha [about 4 acres] of land, where she grows kidney beans.

She runs a business selling cosmetic products. She has been selling these products for over 4 years.  She started this business because she felt the need to produce to sustain her children. She started selling catalog products and now she sells different brands. \r\n\r\nDaniry is receiving her 4th loan and she is very excited to receive it, because after taking loans from Esperanza International, she has been able to increase her sales and inventory.

Her business is at a point of easy access for each of her customers because it is located on the main street and has no competition, and this creates a lot of demand for products.\r\n\r\nShe invested the loan she was granted in buying corn, beans, oil, meat, cold cuts, bread, soft drinks, etc.  The impact she had from the loan was that now she has been able to supply her business and so satisfy the requests for products that her clients make of her every day, as well as generate better income for herself to give her children a good education.\r\n\r\nRosa has future plans to make her business grow more and to buy a car to be able to transport her products.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras--March 2012. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1031144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, beans, sugar, meat, cold cuts, etc., for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Bertilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":1428.58,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749272},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T08:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":748.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287042472},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":748.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646608},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":748.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301494560},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":1428.55,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1497.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308485856}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T23:35:41Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:46:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":402066,"name":"Celestina Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celestina, actualmente labora para una empresa privada en el area de ventas, continua contando con el apoyo de su esposo.

He has three children who are 8, 4 and 2 years old; only the oldest is attending school.  He lives with his family in Santa Barbar\u00e1 Department, Honduras.\r\n\r\nMarlon\u2019s economic activity is farming, specifically coffee growing.  He helped his father with farming chores and with the experience he obtained he decided to become independent 14 years ago.  His father passed down half a manzana [Central American unit of land measurement] to him to start his own crops.  He states that since then he\u2019s done well with the coffee sales since the price of coffee stays steady and he\u2019s reinvested the profits he\u2019s earned to plant more thus increasing resources needed to support his family.

the rural area surrounding La Romana. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children.\r\n\r\nSanta is excited to be taking her 4th loan with Esperanza International, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, where she sells chicken, pork, beef and meat sausages. She will use the profits to buy a battery for her power generator and to save to buy her own house. She said that her most difficult challenge is to travel, as she would like to visit other countries like Hawaii.  This is one of her most cherished dream as she wants to meet other cultures.

In 1987 she left work in a condiment firm in the city to take care of her children.  Since then she started buying cosmetics and blouses that she\u2019d raffle off to earn income and help cover family expenses while tending to her home.  Gradually she started to sell assorted merchandise to her main clientele.  It was usually her former coworkers that she\u2019d sell to on credit that they\u2019d pay off in installments.  This is how she formed her first portfolio of customers.  She gradually added new products like shoes to have new sales lines.  In 1990 she settled in the town of Barrancas, leased an oven in a store and worked for 7 years.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to the city of Barranquilla she built her own house, bought a display case and with the money she had left over bought merchandise that she used to stock her small sales point.  She gradually became associated with firms that promote and sell products via catalogue.  She also has another income generating activity which is making and selling desserts and hayacas [type of tamal wrapped in banana leaves].  With this activity she\u2019s managed to provide her two children with schooling and she dreams with seeing them become successful professionals.\r\n\r\nCurrently, her growing clientele is asking for more products every day and her working capital is insufficient to meet demand which is the reason why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy perfume, underwear and ingredients to make hayacas and desserts.

He is married and has one child.  Otabek lives with his parents.  Together with his father, he is involved in breeding livestock.  When Otabek was still a boy, his father taught him this trade.

","en":"Julia is 53 years old and lives in the city of Barranquilla, where she makes a living selling goods through customer orders. She is married and has a 22 year old son who she hopes will become a successful person. \r\n\r\nThree years ago she saved enough from the stand that her son supplies and started her own business adventure because she needed to feel productive and to financially support her home. This was how she began to purchase bed quilts and towels which she initially sold on credit to friends and relatives. \r\n\r\nJulia has done very well with her business but she hopes for it to grow. The biggest challenge to expanding her business is having enough capital for purchasing and broadening her customer base.

Proposito\" (Dreamer with a purpose) 6. This group is located in the city of El Seybo, one of the most agricultural and rural cities in the Dominican Republic. The borrowers run their businesses in the communities near the city. They sell clothes, shoes, grocery store items and others.\r\n\r\nMargarita makes her home here in a simple house with her long-term partner and four children. She is a devoted mother. She is running a clothing store where she sells all kinds of men's, kid's and women's clothes. She will use this loan to increase her inventory by buying more clothes, specially for the summer season.

Currently, Nadezhda's business is not very developed, but despite that, it provides a stable income for her and her family.  Nadezhda hopes to use the loan to expand the inventory of spring merchandise selection.

her husband and son in the city of Kamenka. She grows early vegetables in greenhouses for sale at city markets. Irina owns a large plot of land and has been farming for three years. She has three big greenhouses and also two greenhouses for seedlings. Her farm is worth 150,000 griven now and she spends 27,000 griven yearly to purchase seeds and plastic foil.\r\n\r\nIrina is planning to use the loan from Kiva to install a heating system in her greenhouses. She needs 12,000 griven so that she can buy the necessary pumps, tubing and holders. Recently Irina used 18,000 griven to purchase a water heater and now she needs this loan to purchase the rest of the supplies and install the heating systems in her greenhouses as she has been planning to do for a long time. This year Irina has invested all of her money into this project but in the future she is hoping to use some of the profits to repair her family home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1043654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Desde el a\u00f1o 1994 cuando regres\u00f3 de prestar el servicio militar, trabaj\u00f3 con su padre en un peque\u00f1o taller de reparaci\u00f3n de tel\u00e9fonos. All\u00ed observando el mercado, fue conciente de la necesidad de atender la demanda de reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de otros aparatos el\u00e9ctricos; fue as\u00ed como de manera independiente 4 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio negocio, con poco conocimiento y apoyado por amigos de mucha experiencia, organizando su taller y poco a poco la experiencia adquirida y su capacidad de riesgo, fueron dando dulces frutos;  consigui\u00f3 clientes en otras ciudades , como en Cartagena, donde le fue muy bien trabaj\u00f3 durante 4 a\u00f1os y estudi\u00f3 perfeccionando sus habilidades t\u00e9cnicas. De regres\u00f3 a Barranquilla, con mucha mas experiencia y un alto potencial de clientes, decidi\u00f3 ubicar un local,  en un punto estrat\u00e9gico del lugar donde vivia,  e inici\u00f3 nuevamente su oficio y se dio a conocer. Hoy se dedica al mantenimiento, la reparaci\u00f3n de electrodom\u00e9sticos y a la compra y venta de ellos, tiene su negocio en un espacio ubicado en un local en  casa de su suegra, donde habita con su familia y genera otros ingresos con la venta de queso, capital de trabajo que tambi\u00e9n produjo su negocio, del cual hoy se siente orgulloso, pues le ha posibilitado adquirir mucho de lo necesario, para su bienestar y el de su familia.

Su meta mas adelante es comprar un osciloscopio, una estaci\u00f3n de soldar, l\u00e1mparas con aumentos, una vitrina de repuestos, aprovechando que en el lugar donde est\u00e1 ubicado no existe un punto comercial de repuestos. Pero su gran desaf\u00edo,  es que  ante sus planes futuros,  no tiene el suficiente capital de trabajo para lograrlo r\u00e1pidamente, pero sabe que debe continuar trabajando para poco a poco lograr sus sue\u00f1os y tener su propia casa para completar el bienestar de su familia. \n","en":"Jos\u00e9, 39, lives with his wife and three children, who are between 10 and 16 years old.  He has always been very creative, and this led him to think of his current job, which today generates the income to house and take care of his family.  In 1994, when he returned from military service, he worked with his father in a small television repair workshop.  In observing the market there, he became aware of the need to repair and maintain other electrical appliances.  Thus four years later, he decided to start his own business.  With little knowledge but with the support of more experienced friends, he organized his workshop bit by bit, acquiring experience and an ability to take risks, and it has paid off: he found clients in other cities, such as Cartagena, where he did very good work for four years and polished his technical skills.  Returning to Barranquilla, with much more experience and a high chance of getting clients, he decided to set up business, in a strategic point in the family home.  Today, he maintains electrical appliances and buys and sells them.  His store is in his mother-in-law's house, where he lives with his family, and he generates additional income by selling cheese, purchased with the working capital produced by his business.  He is very proud of all this, as it has made it possible for him to acquire much of what he needs to look after his own and his family's welfare.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying to Kiva for the second loan he has received from microfinance partner the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He will use the money to buy a batch of televisions that have been offered to him at a good price so he can repair and resell them.  This will generate a much higher profit margin, so this investment has to succeed.  With his first loan from the Foundation, he bought tools, such as a Fluker tester, which is indispensable for the service he provides, since it is very precise.  His future goal is to buy an oscilloscope, a soldering station, enhanced lighting, and a shop window, to take advantage of the fact that in the place where he is located, there are no other repair shops.  But his biggest challenge is that before he can realize these future plans, he needs to get together enough working capital as quickly as possible.

She makes income through her daily work in a store that she owns where she sells snacks, food products and soft drinks.  She started her business as a way of making additional income to put together with that made by her husband who works as a taxi driver in order to provide for their family's well-being.  In addition, she wanted a job that would allow her to be at home close by her children while they are at an age when she needs to educate them and care for them, especially one of them who is disabled.\r\n\r\nMartha started out in her business selling soft drinks but gradually, using her savings, she stocked it with a variety of other goods.  Every day she has new customers and she needs to keep her store stocked with a variety of products that she sometimes does not have.  This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the money to buy oils, pasta, grains and other products that her customers buy every day and which experience a very quick turnover.  As a result of this investment, she will be able to maintain her stock levels and respond effectively to her customers.  The biggest challenge she faces in her business is not having enough working capital to meet her permanent demand.  This is why her investment will be successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1032902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy oils, pasta, grains and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58538},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59904},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61302},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62732},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64196},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65694},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":67227},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68796},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":70401},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72043},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73724},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75443}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.76,"local_amount":58538,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61179.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651481},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":59904,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":62606.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141098},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":61302,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":64067.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100979},{"amount":37.25,"local_amount":62732,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":65562.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338601},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":64196,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":67092.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395167},{"amount":14.56,"local_amount":24516,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25622.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519097},{"amount":278.35,"local_amount":468812,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":489964.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497187}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T07:40:15Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:33:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":404012,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 26 years old and lives in the Philippines.

The group's representative, Sidonie, is the one in the photo with her hand raised. She is 51 years old and did not attend school. Sidonie is a widow but has five children, some of whom have had schooling. All the children are in her care. She lives with her children and is alone in meeting household expenses. \r\n\r\nTo cope with her difference expenses, Sidonie has been selling undergarments out of her home for nearly fifteen years. She gets her supplies from a market in Benin. \r\n\r\nConcerned about bolstering her business further and responding better to the demands of her customers, Sidonie would like to increase her inventory of good. To do so, she is requesting, along with the other members of the group MAHUENA, a second loan from Alid\u00e9.

All her life she has lived in Lusaka, but now she runs her own mobile money transfer business in a small town called Kafue.\r\n \r\nTamara first got started working as a money transfer teller in her brother-in-law\u2019s shop when she was 19 years old. She worked there for over two years and got to know everything there is to know about the business. She then underwent an intense training period and in September 2011, she was given her own shop to run in Kafue. \r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning. She has grown into a full-blown business woman who goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy. Her customers benefit from her business because there is no need to open an account. She is also located right in the heart of Kafue so customers do not have to go far to do their money transfers. \r\n\r\nHer biggest business concern is that she is not able to give her customers the fastest possible service because she has problems accessing the internet due to the poor signal at her shop. She also worries about sometimes having to  ask her customers to wait, as she rushes to the bank and back, to get money to serve them. \r\n \r\nTamara is sure that a loan from Kiva will change her business because it will give her the money she needs to buy a computer and increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nHer hope is for her business to start making more profit by the time she has her baby.

Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio  de vender  productos fritos, como arepas, empanadas, chorizos, papas rellenas, chuzo y chinchurria,  desde el a\u00f1o 2011; su principal clientela la conforman vecinos y visitantes del sector, que le compran de contado todos los d\u00edas, pues trabaja de lunes a jueves desde las 4 de la tarde hasta las 10 de la noche  y de viernes a domingo, desde las 4 hasta las 12 de la noche.  En este sector aunque la competencia es alta,  todos se conocen y compiten, mientras ella se sostiene con precios justos, amabilidad y calidad en sus productos.

She started her business selling fried snacks like arepas [stuffed, grilled corn cakes], turnovers, sausages, stuffed potatoes, brochettes and fried tripe since 2011.  Her main clientele is formed by neighbors and visitors to the sector who buy and pay cash daily because she works Monday through Thursday from 4 in the afternoon until 10 at night and Fridays through Sundays from 4 until midnight.  Competition is high in this sector.  Everyone knows each other and competes but she stays in business with fair prices, kindness and the quality of her products.  Her greatest challenge is attaining business growth because she lacks working capital for her projections and more staff to reach her dreams.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a Kiva loan at present, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she will use to buy raw materials like oil, dough, salt, meat and cheese at higher volume to meet ever expanding demand.  While Diana works to reach her dreams she has 1.35% liquidity and a profit margin on sales of no less than 44%, financial indicators from which we predict growth for her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1032946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, dough, salt, meat and cheese in greater volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52938},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59774},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61168},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62596},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64056},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65551},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67080},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":68645},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70247},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71886},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73564},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":52938,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":55326.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651486},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":747062,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":780768.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993838}],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T15:49:59Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":402537,"name":"Jair Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jair  de 26 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al sur de la ciudad y tiene un negocio mediante el cual ofrece servicios de internet, fotocopiado y llamadas.

This neighborhood has many formal and informal productive  alternatives.  He has a small store where he sells clothing for infants that he has been making in his own shop since he moved to Barranquilla ten years ago to live here.  He came from his native Santander Department in 2000 to start his own business as is usual for natives of this department.  \r\n\r\nVery quickly Carlos won over a clientele made up of neighbors who now buy from him at wholesale and stores on the Atlantic coast.  He\u2019s gradually been increasing his clientele with them even though he has a lot of competition but he stays in business thanks to fair prices and quality products and service.  \r\n\r\nHis customers pay him in 30 or 60 days and this is why he\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, his second loan from this institution and first from Kiva that he plans to use to finance his portfolio buying raw materials and accessories to make clothes for infants and other items like cradles, covers, diaper bags, walkers, etc.\r\n\r\nHis investment will be successful because he knows his market very well and he\u2019ll have additional working capital to buy in volumes higher than usual which is a competitive edge in negotiating prices.  He managed to attain greater liquidity and a display case with his previous loan consequently improving his quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1032992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and accessories to make baby clothes and other items like cradles, covers, diaper bags, walkers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171490},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":181644},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":185882},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190219},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":194658},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":206107}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.42},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.64,"local_amount":171490,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":173634.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651491},{"amount":104.49,"local_amount":181644,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":183915.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141107},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":185882,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":188206.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100988},{"amount":109.42,"local_amount":190219,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":192597.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338610},{"amount":111.97,"local_amount":194658,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":197092.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395176},{"amount":118.56,"local_amount":206107,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":208684.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774985}],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T11:39:39Z","paid_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":402587,"name":"Martina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Martina  de 52 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene un nieto que depende de ella, tiene casa propia, su casa esta ubicada en San Lorenzo.\nDo\u00f1a Martina se dedica desde hace unos 9 a\u00f1os a elaborar y vender tortillas para los vecinos de la comunidad, muy temprano todo los d\u00edas de lunes a domingo prepara en dos jornada las tortillas para ser vendidas en su casa, hasta su casa llegan los clientes que ella tiene a comprarle sus tortillas, a Do\u00f1a Martina le ayuda  una de sus hijas a preparar sus tortillas.\nDo\u00f1a Martina esta solicitando 7,000.00 lempiras a PRISMA  para comprar ma\u00edz y le\u00f1a para elaborar sus tortillas. \nCon las ganancias de su negocio ella  le compra medicina a su nieto y le compra la ropa que usa en la escuela.\nSu sue\u00f1o es seguir trabajando para sacar adelante a su negocio y su familia.\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - Marzo del 2012\n","en":"Do\u00f1a Martina is 52 and a single mother.

Fue as\u00ed como en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa durante 5 a\u00f1os fabricaban  chicha,  logando una venta diaria de 300 bolsas, las cuales repart\u00edan entre tiendas y a particulares ubicados en su sector, pero por complejidad del transporte diario del producto, que deb\u00edan trasladarlo desde la ciudad de Barranquilla hasta la Urbanizaci\u00f3n la Playa, decidieron no seguir y dedicarse a tener una vivienda propia. Fue as\u00ed como se instalaron en un terreno donde poco a poco construyeron la vivienda que hoy poseen, inicialmente fue de madera, pero poco a poco lograron construirla en cemento y dejaron un espacio locativo decidido con el prop\u00f3sito de tener una tienda. All\u00ed vend\u00edan art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar por un tiempo de 3 a\u00f1os, pero la proliferaci\u00f3n de este tipo de negocios en el sector, los oblig\u00f3 a cambiar de actividad por una helader\u00eda y donde tambi\u00e9n estuvieron 3 a\u00f1os m\u00e1s, pues el hurto continuo del cableado el\u00e9ctrico,  casi los dej\u00f3 descapitalizados, teniendo que arrendar el local, con el fin de generar ingresos mas seguros. Rafael y su esposa decidieron entonces, vender mercanc\u00edas en general y vincularse con proveedores que le suministran cat\u00e1logos para promocionar los productos. Rafael tambi\u00e9n tiene 14 a\u00f1os de trabajar como vigilante de un edificio y maneja su propia clientela. Siempre apoyado por su esposa, ha logrado sacar adelante a sus hijos. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, sexto cr\u00e9dito que recibe de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n a la que est\u00e1 vinculado, hace 8 a\u00f1os y de su mano ha logrado hacer crecer su negocio y mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales. Con su credikiva planea continuar mejorando su vivienda y levantar paredes, pues tiene problemas de humedad que afectan a su vecino, as\u00ed mismo terminar\u00e1 de construir una de sus habitaciones en la parte trasera de la vivienda,  para lograr el acomodamiento de toda su familia en su hogar y mayor sosiego. ","en":"52 year old Rafael is married and has 2 children who are 16 and 32 years old. He works selling goods that he promotes through special catalogs. He began doing this 11 years ago when he was working as a guard. He decided to combine his job with other work that would also generate income in order to support his family. In this way, along with his wife, he spent 5 years making chichi (a sort of fermented drink), and reached daily sales of 300 bags which they delivered to stores and people in the neighborhood. But, because of transport complications for their product, which they had to move from the city of Barranquilla to the La Playa urban area, they didn't continue and decided to focus on having their own home.  So, they got some land where, little by little, they built the house that the own today. At first they built it of wood, but, little by little, they were able to build parts from cement and they left a space empty with the idea of having a store there.  They sold family groceries there for 3 years but the proliferation of these sorts of businesses in the neighborhood obliged them to change their store to an ice cream place, which they then ran for 3 more years. However, the continuous theft of electrical wiring almost left them broke and they had to lease the store space so that they could have a more secure income. Then Rafael and his wife decided to sell general supplies and to link themselves to companies that use catalogs to promote their products. \r\nRafael also has 14 years of work experience as a guard and has his own clients. Always supported by his wife, he has been able to bring up his children. At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan and this will be the 6th loan he has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization he has been associated with for 8 years and which has helped him to grow his business and improve his living conditions. With his Kiva loan, he plans to continue improving his home and building walls. He has damp problems that are affecting his neighbor and also will finish building one of the rooms in the back part of the house so that there is space for all the family and greater peace. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1033183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to build walls as he has a problem with damp, and to build a room in the back part of his house.
