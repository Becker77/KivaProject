He used to work for a company that produced and sold shoes, but he retired from this position in 1985 so that he could start up his own venture.  He bought shoe lasts (molds) and a motor, with which he began making sandals that he would sell to his relatives and friends. Very soon people began to take note of the quality of his products.  He would display each design in his own home, and he started to sell by the dozens to customers who had their own clientele, and so in this way he has continued to work.  His dream is to have more growth in his workshop, so that he could hire workers and generate jobs.  In addition, he would like to have his own place where he could exclusively display his shoes.  However, his main challenge is that he lacks the working capital he needs to achieve his dreams and be able to respond to his rapidly growing customer base.  At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan, and this will be the first time that he has had financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy glue, leather, heels, platforms and plastic, and he will also make some repairs to his shoe stitching machine.  He expects that this investment will be successful for two reasons.  First, with the loan he will have more working capital and so will be able to buy in cash and in greater volume, so that he will be able to get discounts. Second, he brings a lot of technical experience to the project, acquired when he was an employee of a company that makes one of the best quality brands of shoes in Colombia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1029745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy glue, leather, heels, platforms and plastic, and he will also make some repairs to his shoe stitching machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":109759},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":112320},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114941},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117623},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":120367},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":123176},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":126050},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":128991},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":132001},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135081},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":138233},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":141458}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.55,"local_amount":222079,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":228027.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141104},{"amount":67.05,"local_amount":114941,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":118019.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338607},{"amount":678.4,"local_amount":1162980,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1194128.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519103}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T18:02:31Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":402627,"name":"Yadira Jamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yadira Yamileth de 41 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera, sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando, uno la universidad y el menor terminando la primaria; labora para la municipalidad como inspector ambiental desde hace 3 a\u00f1os.

She also generates income through the sale of merchandise; she has orders for shoes and she needs to respond to new orders so she can capitalize more on her business. This is why she is requesting her first loan with Kiva. She will use it to buy raw materials and ingredients for preparing foods, and shoes, which she sells through specialized catalogs. She has some orders that came with discounts, which she will pass on to her customers so they will remain loyal.

She is a entrepreneur at the market, where she sells a most diverse assortment of goods:  children's jackets, windbreakers, men's and women's hats, as well as backpacks and camping gear.  Natalya has already been selling hats for quite some time; she started 15 years ago.  However, by training, Natalya is a guide.  Four times a year, she leads various groups on hiking trips.  When the time came, her skills and the experience she earned as a guide helped her to open a sales outlet for camping gear, which she added to her assortment of clothes and hats.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Natalya has 40,000 hryven invested in inventory.

Their average age is 40 and they have an average of four children each. They all live in the Darsalam neighbourhood in S\u00e9gou (the 4th largest administrative region of Mali) and know each other as neighbours, relatives and through their activities at the market in S\u00e9gou. \n\nThe women all work in small-scale commerce, selling handbags, wax pagnes (traditional printed cloth) and juice made locally. In order to replenish their supply of ready funds, they have signed up to the Soro Yiriwaso credit programme and this is their 11th solidarity loan. \n\nKadiatou, standing in the middle, has a good reputation selling wax pagnes in Darsalam and at the market. She will use her loan to buy 50 lengths of wax pagne. She restocks at the S\u00e9gou grand market and sometimes in Bamako. She sells her goods on credit and her customers are mainly women. She hopes to make 80 000 CFA francs on average per month, which will be reinvested in her business, and used to buy household supplies and healthcare items for the children. Kadiatou's ambition for her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso is to buy a plot for housing.

With the help of his wife, they purchased their first cattle.\r\n\r\nXudakarim usually buys small calves and raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, then resells them for a more profitable price in the livestock bazaar. His monthly income is 230 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income in his family. \r\n\r\nBeef is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Xudakarim also keeps milking cows for personal use and for selling to neighbors.  \r\n\r\nHe wants to expand his business and improve the living conditions of his family. He applied for a 1500 AZN loan to purchase two calves, one milking cow and fodder. This will be his third loan from AqroInvest CU and he has a good client

(Blessed Women) Trust Bank, which is comprised of nine women who are determined to develop successful businesses with their loans. The Trust Bank is located in a small town called San Jose Xepatan, Patzun, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, which is a very agricultural area. The majority of the inhabitants grow vegetables like green beans and broccoli. Within the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank, five of the women are engaged in agriculture, another woman sells fruit, two ladies have convenience stores and one member operates a tortilla-making shop. All of them are also weavers. \r\n\r\nMaria is on her fifth loan with Friendship Bridge. The 54-year-old has never attended school and is divorced. She has six children, and four of them are still at home. Maria is an entrepreneur and works hard every day to support her children. She buys and sells vegetables and fruit, traveling to the market, which is located 20 minutes from her home, to sell her products on Tuesdays and Fridays from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. During the rest of the week, Maria and her family work in the field growing green beans and broccoli. Maria only started selling fruit five years ago, but her business is growing, which allows her to dedicate more money to raising crops. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s dream is to expand her businesses so that she has a larger variety of products to sell. She wants to use her income to help her younger children continue in school; most of her older children only have a sixth-grade education. With her new loan, she will be purchasing seeds for planting more green beans and broccoli, as well as purchasing fruits and vegetables for resale.\r\n\r\nLike Maria, the other eight women in the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank are so thankful to have the support of KIVA investors. The women realize that KIVA investors work hard like they do and appreciate that others are willing to share their earnings with women in Guatemala so that they can create better opportunities for their children.

Narcissa has been in this business for 15 years and sells a variety of items such as soft drinks, canned goods, eggs, noodles, soap, etc. In the future Narcissa would like to save enough money so she can afford to send her children to college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1043328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more inventory to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brookes Point, Palawan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2012-03-19T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-18T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132,"local_amount":5280,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5687.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270108847},{"amount":88,"local_amount":3520,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3791.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276723387},{"amount":55,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2369.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283361705}],"funded_date":"2012-03-19T15:54:11Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:38:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":402706,"name":"Demetrio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Demetrio naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Lamay y tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l es casado y fruto de esta uni\u00f3n tiene dos hijos, \u00e9l vive en la ciudad donde naci\u00f3 y donde realiza sus actividades econ\u00f3micas, \u00e9l se dedica a la venta de pasto a una empresa privada.

While it is a fairly quiet community, the town has a variety of bustling commerce activities. In the West Village of Patzun, the Trust Bank Mujeres de \u00c9xito (Successful Women) was formed four years ago and currently has nine determined women in the group, all of whom identify with the name of the Trust Bank. The vast majority of women in this group are engaged in hand weaving, selling screws and selling fruits and vegetables. They are all neighbors and know each other well.  \r\n\r\nMaria Magdalena is a member of the Mujeres de \u00c9xito Trust Bank. She is 50 years old, married, and has eight children (four of them still live at home). Thanks to Maria and her husband\u2019s hard work, all of her children were in school until the heavy rains hit Guatemala last year and her oldest child, who was in college, had to drop out. Maria Magdalena only has three years of education, because her family couldn\u2019t support her schooling anymore. Maria learned to make huipiles (traditional blouses) when she was a child, and over time she learned the styles from other places. She now makes different styles of huipiles from different areas. She also learned how to make chocolate (a product that originated in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, where she is originally from). Maria Magdalena travels to Antigua, Guatemala (two hours away from home), Monday through Saturday and sells her products from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. She also sells her products in Patzun on Sundays.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Maria Magdalena will buy fabric and thread to make huipiles. She will also use the materials to make aprons since her orders are on the rise because the Easter season is fast approaching. She will also use her loan to buy more ingredients to make chocolates so that she can keep up with demand (she has many orders for chocolates as well). One of Maria Magdalena\u2019s goals is to grow her businesses and have her children help manage the businesses with her. She also wants to help her child, who had to drop out of college, go back to school. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful to Friendship Bridge for the opportunity to have been a client for the past four years, which has allowed her to invest in her business. Likewise, the Trust Bank that she belongs to feels so grateful to the KIVA lenders because even though they do not know the lenders, they rely on their support.

She lives with her parents and siblings in their own home located in Ocoro, Colcabamba.  She is characterized by having a strong expression, which she shows in her work.  As a good woman, she dedicates her time and effort to agriculture.  This is a trade she learned when she was very young.  Currently she makes the most of it by being able to generate income for her family.  She does not yet have a husband or children, but this doesn't bother her.  She says, \"being by the side of my siblings and parents makes me feel happy.\"  Her main crops are corn and potatoes.  She sells them in the city of Huancayo and in the capital of the country during the main growing season.\r\n\r\nLike every enthusiastic woman, she hopes to increase her profits and save money to buy her own land, since she doesn't have her own right now.

She currently rents her house.  Her husband is a taxi driver. The applicant sells eggs with potato flour and noodles in a crowded market in the city of Santa Cruz. She goes out and starts selling her food from 6 am until 10 am. By then, she has no more food to sell. She sells everything.  She has been doing this type of activity for more than two years and generating good income from it. Since she is currently renting, Lidia would like to get this loan with  this institution since she would like to create a land pawn contract (known as anticr\u00e9tico) for two rooms. This contract consists of giving a certain quantity of money to the owner for a year, and the following year the owner returns the same amount of money. The owner lives off of the interest of the money; in this way it functions almost like a loan to the owner. The customer thanked the institution for the opportunity and at the same time appreciated  how fast she was offered

Now she has two stalls, and uses one of them to sell mostly children's clothing imported from Turkey.  In the time since Gulnar started taking out loans from our organization, her working capital more than doubled. Gulnor plans to expand her stock of ready-to-wear products in order to receive sufficient revenues so that her husband would no longer  need to leave Tajikistan in search of work.

This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to country rural poor, who often do not have access to credit as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lali will purchase materials for greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where vegetables and greens will be grown throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nLali and Iason will work in the greenhouse themselves. They will sell their harvested produce at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

She is unmarried and lives in Akhmeta District, East Georgia. Leila is an agricultural worker. She provides various seasonal agricultural services to local farmers. She earns 250 Laris per month. Leila can be esteemed to belong to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nLeila used to have a small poultry farm, but she sold her hens two years ago, as she needed to buy medicines for her elderly mother. Now she has requested a loan for re-starting the farm. She received the loan in the framework of a start-up loan program, initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at provision of business start-up or business re-start credits to Georgian rural poor, who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with high risk of default\u201d. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit Leila will purchase chickens and raise them. After 4-5 months she will start the sale of hens. Hens will be sold on the open market of the nearby town by Leila. She will reinvest the profit for further expansion of the farm. Also part of the profit will be used for purchasing necessary household goods, to improve her living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1044361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ozhio","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-03-19T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-18T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276706597},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283194558},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358213},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":51.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394409},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449248},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":154.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209451},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":309.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440215},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":309.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045300}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T14:30:26Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":404557,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is 46 years old, married, and has four adult children.

They all possess the initiative to change and make progress.  \n\nOne such member is Sra. Roci\u00f3.  She is 39 years old and the mother of two young children.  Roci\u00f3 has been selling beauty products for more than eight years and it has enabled her to support her household and provide her children with the care and education that they need.  In the future, she would like to open a grocery store so that she can be near her home all the time.  With this recent loan, she will buy more beauty products that are in season.  \n\nJust like Sra. Roci\u00f3, the other members of the Communal Bank \"Dios es Amor y Mi Guia\" are enterprising and determined women whose only objective is to succeed for themselves and the welfare of their families.

\n\n\n","en":"Saparkul was born in 1963 in the town of Zherge-Tal in the Tian-Shan district of the Naryn province (in northern Kyrgyzstan). In 1982 after finishing school she began as a simple laborer in a factory in Bishkek, where she worked for three years. In 1985 she married, moved with her husband to the town of Temir-Kanat in the Tong district and found work in the Tong district's manufacturing plant. Unfortunately her and her husband's salaries were not enough to cover the family's expenses. After working until 1991 and having saved up 5,000 som, Saparkul decided to begin her own livestock business, and bought a milk cow. \r\n\r\nEven as she just began to work in agriculture, Saparkul set a goal: to have a large farm and a well deserved and bright future for her children. Being by nature a purposeful, patient, hardworking woman, Saparkul was able to reach her goals. At this time she has 3 head of cattle, 20 head of sheep and one horse, an smallish sheepyard and 2.10 hectares of irrigated land from which she harvests clover, wheat, barley and potatoes annually. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Saparkul came to the Bai-Tushum and Partners company for a 120,000 som (KGS) loan, with the goal of increasing the number of livestock she has for raising and later sale. Saparkul plans to use profit from the loan to invest in expanding the sheep yard.
