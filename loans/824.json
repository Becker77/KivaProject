Her husband helps her in the business and also works in civil construction.\r\n\r\nHer dream for the future is to have more knitting machines and to become a wholesaler.

She lives in Pisco, a city known for having Peru's most important tourist attractions, the  Candelabro de Paracas and the Ballestas Islands.  Likewise, Pisco is known for its main industries, fishing and agriculture.  Graciela is very enthusiastic.  In her free time, she likes to go for walks, especially if she feels worried.  Like a good Peruvian, she likes food a lot, and one of her favorite dishes is the delicious \u201cAj\u00ed de Gallina\u201d (a traditional spicy chicken stew).  Graciela only went to school until fifth grade, but she would have liked to have studied accounting.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of work, Graciela was able to start a business selling bread, which is her current work.  Graciela gets up very early in order to sell her products, especially because the majority of her customers want to eat her delicious bread early, for breakfast.  She works about 3 hours a day, during which time she can serve up to 40 customers.  She believes that her business is going well because she is very friendly with her customers, and above all, she is responsible.\r\n\r\nGraciela is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help she will be able to purchase a display rack to better display her products, which will allow her to have better earnings so she can study and keep fighting for her grand dream: \"to have her own home and to study the profession of accounting.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1036582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and lives with his wife Maka, daughter, and 61-year-old mother. Datuna and Maka run the agricultural activities of the family, which is the main source of income for the family. They have a 220 sq meter greenhouse and a plot of land. They grow cucumbers and tomatoes, which are sold locally as well as in nearby villages. The family has been involved in this business for 11 years. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, they have been working hard to expand their farm. Datuna received a good harvest of vegetables last year, which was sold for a convenient price. He already covered his first Kiva loan. Now Datuna has requested credit for the expansion of the family's agricultural business. With the borrowed money he will purchase materials for greenhouse construction \u2013 wooden pillars and polyethylene cover.

She was independent since childhood and loved to help her mother to take care of the home. Lidiya got married right after she graduated from high school. Her husband was already working in the local collective farm at the time and after their wedding the farm had given them a house to live which they have bought out later. Lidiya has found a job in the same farm as a milkmaid. A year later in 1989 their oldest daughter was born and then in 1991 their second daughter. In search of an additional income for her family Lidiya started doing animal husbandry and used an amount  of 2,000 som (KGS) to start the business. Thanks to the efforts and perseverance of Lidya the income from the business allowed them to buy a new home in 2002.\r\n\r\nRight now Lidiya's business has three heifers, twelve pigs and nine sheep. Lidiya has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to buy two heifers with a goal to further grow her business. She plans to invest the income form the loan in the increase of headcount of cattle and in the future she dreams to buy an SUV.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1049532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Voznesenovka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":60823.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938493}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T04:40:44Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":404703,"name":"Erdenebayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenebayar is 41 years old and lives with her husband and 3 kids in the skid row of the capital city in Mongolia.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output and renovate his house. In the picture background, other agricultural borrowers are observing the cameraman.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He is single and has one child, age 3 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sulaiman established his DVD, VCD  and television business. He began his business because he wants to enhance his independence and that is the sole source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000.

There was nothing else that could bring income into the home because of the ideology that girl children are not meant for school, but only to be at their marital homes.

She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. She requires a loan in order to buy 10 rolls of cotton lace @ 300,000 each. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 963,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mariama plans to rent a big shop on the most busy street in town so that she can have more sales and realize more profit, and also support her husband in educating their child to university level.

Akob has been working as a tailor since 1985. He works from his own house because his business doesn't bring in enough income to rent an atelier to work in.\r\n\r\nAkob is a hard worker. He has a very good reputation and special customers who are very loyal to him since they like the good quality products he makes.\r\n\r\nAkob has been an Al Majmoua borrower for twelve cycles.

They are local entrepreneurs who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan of 500,000.00 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for each. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their businesses, increase their sales, and consequently improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nDora, age 49, is the leader of this group.

She is married and has 3 children, ages 38, 34 and 23 years. She has no additional dependents that live with her.  \r\n\r\nIn 1992, Ya-Almamy established her provisions business. She began her business because she did not go to school. Therefore, at the age of 20, her parents gave her for marriage to a business tycoon. As a hardworking woman, she decided to request from her husband to establish her own business and not to depend on the husband alone. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,050,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Ya-Almamy requests a loan in order to buy 60 tins of blue plate mayonnaise @ 15,000, 100 tins of luncheon meat @ 9,000, and 4 bags of sugar @ 280,000.

Another of her goals is for her only child to study, so that he can have a professional career that will provide him with a better standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1037627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies for planting her fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301363218},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347045386},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399792870},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459081650}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T19:53:17Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:07:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":404422,"name":"Vasil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vasil is 52 years old.

Two years ago he was running a cattle-breeding business, but he sold the cattle, as he didn\u2019t have a job for a long time and needed money to finance daily costs for food. Now he received a loan in the framework of a start-up loan program, initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at provision of business start-up or business re-start loans to Georgian rural poor, who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with high risk of default\u201d. \n\nWith the requested loan, Vasil will purchase calves and raise them for 5-6 months. In early fall he will sell calves and get income. Vasil plans to expand the business in the future, through purchasing more and more calves. The business will give Vasil additional income and he will be able to live in better conditions. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1044322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Koghoto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vasil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.63,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276706596},{"amount":1194.37,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1970.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283194557}],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T13:39:20Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:22:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":403164,"name":"Michael Sivianny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Michael Sivianny, tiene la edad 23 de  a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 soltero y vive con sus padres y hermanos.

Among the myths concerning it some say that it\u2019s a derivation originally made by an Englishman: \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d (Talca seems like London) because of the abundant fog that

She sells a variety of merchandise. and has been doing this work since the the time she was studying for her high school diploma, and was selling magazines, candy, and everything her fellow students were able to buy from her. \r\n\r\nGradually, as she moved forward in life, she realized she could generate income through business, and worked to add many more products to the merchandise she sold, by using specialized guides. This is how she began her work of attracting customers. \r\n\r\nToday it is a business through which she helps supports the functioning of her household. Because by selling beauty products and clothing, she has managed to go to school and deal with her personal expenses for six years. \r\n\r\nCurrently, her greatest challenge is to achieve enough income to serve her customers, especially when the magazines or catalogs offer special discounts. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she is applying for her credikiva loan, her first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy clothing and footwear: a line of products she currently doesn't sell, and that will increase her clientele.

His greatest success came with the development of the BiCon, a military suited shower\/latrine facility, in 2009. In 2010, he had planned to seriously market this product; however, his plans were halted when he was sent to travel  internationally for long spans with his full-time job. For the next two years he only had the opportunity to push his smaller, less significant products. \r\n\r\nGary is determined to start selling the BiCon in 2012.

They are 40 years old on average and have an average of six children each.  They all live in the village of Beni in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative region of Mali) and know each other through neighborhood, family and marriage connections, and through their business activities in the village.  They buy and sell soap, peanut paste, rice, and local juices.  With the goal of increasing their business funds, the group members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first cooperative loan cycle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatoumata (seated at center in the photo) sells peanut paste in the village of Beni and the surrounding area.  She plans to use her loan to buy a bag of peanuts in the Cinzana Gare market, which she will make into peanut paste.  To make peanut paste, the best peanuts must first be separated, then roasted and peeled.  After removing the skins, the peanuts are ground.

Como cada le va mucho mejor, se siente satisfecho, pero su plan  de crecimiento es mayor que su capital de trabajo, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que haca a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 frutas en mayor volumen, para tener un diverso surtido en un punto en su casa donde atender\u00e1 su esposa, tambi\u00e9n mejorar\u00e1 el carro de frutas y comprar uniformes para mostrar su pulcritud en el manejo de los alimentos, acompa\u00f1ada de una excelente imagen comercial y esto es justamente lo que justifica el \u00e9xito de su inversi\u00f3n.","en":"Alejandro, aged 30, lives with his wife and two daughters aged 5 and 8.  They have a fruit stand, which he started when he began selling mangoes and plums in front of a school.  His biggest market were the children who came out of the school at the end of the school day.\r\n\r\nAs he didn't have many customers during the kids' holidays, he decided to go sell on the street.  This was how he proposed to the administrator of a business that he sell a variety of fruit in the transportation center that she managed.  He noted to her that he would maintain a good stock which would meet the needs of the passengers.  It was in this way that he started at this location, and today he has been here for six years.\r\n\r\nAs things continue to go much better for him, he feels satisfied.  However, his plan for growth is greater than his working capital, which is the reason why he's come for a Kiva loan.  This his first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will purchase a greater volume of fruit so as to have a diverse stock at the fruit stand that his wife tends to at their home.  He will also improve his fruit cart, and purchase uniforms to show his hygienic food handling together with an excellent business image.  This is precisely what will justify the success of his
