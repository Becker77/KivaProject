Este es el tercer ciclo en el Banco Comunal y le gusta porque los pagos son f\u00e1ciles de hacer.\n \nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un local para vender ropa y todos sus productos.\n\n","en":"The members of the 4 de Agosto communal bank meet every two weeks.  They meet in the Andr\u00e9s De Vera parish in the city of Poroviejo, which is known as the city of the Royal Tamarinds.  \r\n\r\nThis is where Gina, age 36, lives.  She is married and has three children, ages 15, 13, and 10.  The two older children go to high school, and the younger one goes to primary school.  Her husband is a security guard.  She is a great mother and wife.  In order to get her own resources and to help her husband with the household expenses, she sells clothes by catalog.  She also sells Avon, Esika, and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women\u2019s accessories).\r\n\r\nShe works every day, and she sells by going door to door.  However, the customers she knows the best come to her house.  She leaves the products on credit, and she collects every week-end.  She has been doing this for over six years, and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, pants, blouses, and general clothing.  This is her third cycle in her communal bank.  She likes it because the payments are easy to make.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a place to sell clothes and all of her products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1042693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics, pants, blouses, and general clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-22T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-21T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034175},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646260},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321339},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208936},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335251},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391088},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150123}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T02:36:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":405607,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 59 years old and married.

been involved in repairing cars for over 20 years.  He takes individual work orders to repair cars and, thus, supports his family.  Kamo remodeled his own garage into an auto repair shop, where he runs his business.  He brings in necessary spare parts from Yerevan and uses his own small, older truck for this purpose.  This allows him to reduce business expenses significantly.  Kamo also has all of the necessary equipment for the business.  He loves his work very much and works without days off for this reason.  \r\n\r\nKamo is 49 years old, and he lives in the city of Kapan.  He was born in Nagorno-Karabakh and moved to Kapan when he was young as he decided to apply to the Kapan construction college.  Kamo is married and has three children - two daughters and a son.

In 1994, while looking for a source of income, she started her own business selling small personal and home accessories with an initial investment of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Elmira succeeded in developing her business so that it now earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently, the variety of goods on offer is limited, which is why Elmira has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS).

Today, her business, which she started with an initial investment of 60,000 som (KGS), earns roughly 15,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products. Thanks to Gulbara's persistent work, her herd currently has 4 dairy cows and 15 sheep. In order to continue developing her business, Gulbara has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a credit of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock.

With the few resources she had, and taking advantage of her knowledge of beauty and personal care, several years ago she set up a beauty salon in her house, where she does a variety of jobs such as dyes, haircuts, and nail painting, among other things.  She works every day from 8:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., and sometimes until later if her customers need her services.  She also sells beauty products, for which she has some display cases.  She has been doing this work for more than 14 years and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy dyes, perms, and some work tools.

to support it. When he arrived in the United States in 2007, he took his first job as a gardener's assistant, but strived to work for himself. He soon decided to open his own lawn care service under the name Gustavo Lawn Service. He used his own money to purchase a van and the equipment that it would take to support his business. As he began to acquire clients, he changed the name of his business to Black Pearl Enterprises and began to see even higher success. The heightened success allowed him to buy more equipment and begin to employ assistants. \r\n\r\nGustavo now serves 260 accounts in his Florida community and hopes to continue to grow his business. He has set up an organized schedule in which he serves his clients and has made room for immediate growth. He would like this loan to purchase more equipment to more efficiently run his business. At this point he sees this as his only set back to further

He founded Progressive Concepts Inc. in the greater Boston area and quickly forged a relationship with a large courier contractor, but also wanted to continue to serve local businesses as well.\r\n\r\n Mainly he has targeted his business to support local laboratories, transporting lab results, as well as active experiments. However, in late January, an unlucky twist of fate threatened his business greatly. His main vehicle was involved in a car accident. Jocelyn worked hard to find a temporary solution for this problem, but now needs a new vehicle to continue his business. Jocelyn is looking for a loan to purchase a new vehicle for his courier service so that he can once again operate at full capacity.

She is married with two children, 15 years old and 20 years old. One of her children is currently attending school. In 1999, Moorenikeh established her boutique business. She began her business because she wanted to enhance her independence and to assist her husband in setting some domestic problem. She also earns income from a commercial taxi. She works at the business 11 hours a day and 6 days per week.

As the job did not require much leg movement he could spend more time sitting at work which is why he specialized in the manufacture and repair of shoes. Oscar now has many clients, and it is a good and profitable business.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan will be invested in the purchase of leather, which will enable him to continue working, either making or repairing shoes.

They live in the city of Camana which is known for it's hot climate, beautiful beaches, cultivation of rice and for being a place that you can get deliciously prepared shrimp. In his free time Marcos likes to go fishing because it is relaxing and helps him forget about his problems. Like a good Peruvian, he likes traditional food; his favorite dish is 'Pollo a la Braza' (roasted chicken). Marcos only studied in primary school, which is why he works so hard so that his children will be better than him and have a better future.  \r\n\r\nHe puts great effort into his work as a master builder. He works close to 12 hours a day, depending on the size and type of construction that he is doing. He believes his business is doing well because he does good work and because his finished products are of good quality and look good, and for these reasons his customers recommend him to others. \r\n\r\nMarcos is very thankful and happy for the help that has been provided by Kiva lenders. Thanks to your support he will be able to buy wood and tools (ropes, hammers, spatulas for plastering walls, as well as other things) that will allow him to do his construction work, especially when constructing roofs for houses. This will allow him to have the tools that are necessary to do his work, and in this way continue to work so that he can realize his greatest dream of helping his children become professionals.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1044540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and tools.

She currently has a small soft drink store in her house and earns some money from it. She sells to her friends and neighbors. She says that now that she has been selling her products for many years and is well known in her neighborhood, thanks to God, she sells a lot. She always has music playing in her business and she believes that this attracts her customers. She will invest this loan in the purchase of a variety of soft drinks to revive her business.

Most people who live here work as merchants or farmers, or they raise animals.  These individuals have been with their communal bank for 3 loan cycles, and they are very pleased with the help that they have been getting from the institution.\r\n\r\nIn this place we meet Rosa, who is 50 years old.  Her husband died a number of years ago and left her alone with their 6 children.  Now 4 of these children are adults, while the other two, aged 13 and 15, are in school.  Three of her children still live with her.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, and to meet the needs of her children, Rosa has worked for many years in her parish church, doing chores such as cleaning and other activities.  But, as this did not generate enough income to cover her household expenses and the expenses of raising her children, a friend motivated her to start to sell clothing.  Now, she shares her time between working at the church and selling clothing, which she does in the evenings and nights.  Rosa has been selling clothing for 2 years, and this business is going very well.\r\n\r\nRosa will use this loan to buy more merchandise such as: pants, blouses, T-shirts and children's clothing.  This is her 3rd loan cycle in the communal bank, and she likes it because the loans have been a great help to her with her business.\r\n\r\nRosa's dream is for her children to have everything they need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":1044621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, T-shirts and children's clothing\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"24 de Mayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dagny Yalile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yisela Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celeste Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduvije Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Amira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wagner Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4345,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":435,"local_amount":434.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034179},{"amount":870,"local_amount":869,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":870,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646264},{"amount":356.89,"local_amount":356.48,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":356.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321343},{"amount":730.76,"local_amount":729.92,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":730.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208940},{"amount":888.03,"local_amount":887.01,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":888.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335255},{"amount":1069.32,"local_amount":1068.09,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391091}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T22:14:43Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":406072,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 33 years old, separated, and has three children.

is Cecilla, 63, resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Leandro, her business partner. She together with her husband manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCecilla operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCecilla dreams to grow her business and secure her future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1049845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

age 51, operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also prepares and sells cooked viands for an additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.  \r\n   \r\nPasencia lives with her husband Ferdinand in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite. Ferdinand works as a driver. They have four children and they manage their household while operating their respective businesses. Patencia is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPasencia hopes to see her business grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business.

She is married and mother of five children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLina operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLina hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give all her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1049885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"

She has five children between the ages of 2 and 17 and all five are enrolled in school. Her husband's name is Kaingu and he works as a businessman. \r\n\r\nZainabu operates a poultry-keeping business and a car hire business and sells her goods from home. She's worked in this business for five years. Her primary customers are neighbours. Zainabu's other source of income includes a tailoring and dressmaking business.

She is married to Alex, her business partner, and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmma operates a business where she sells watches and cell phones. She buys them at wholesale prices and sells them for a small profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices. Aside from her retail business she also earns an income through her tap water refilling station. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEmma dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1049942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy watches and cell phones for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":9333,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9444.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998106},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9334,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":9445.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606646},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9332.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":9444.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095503},{"amount":165,"local_amount":7000.04,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7083.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359114}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T00:01:11Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":406945,"name":"Ngon\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Ngon\u00e9 habite dans une des localit\u00e9s du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.
