is Magdalena, sixty-two, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Pacifico, her business partner, and is the mother of three children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMagdalena dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1050086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is married, and has four children aged 30, 21, 12 and 9 years old. He has no additional dependents which live with him. In 1982, Mohamed established his bread baking business. He began his business because he did not go to school as he is a Fulla and his culture believes in doing business rather than getting an education. As a result, when he was ten, he joined his dad, in the bread baking business. When he got married, he established his own bakery.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Mohamed has already received and successfully repaid the first loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy 20 bags of flour at SLL 220,000 and 100 bundles of wood at SLL 5,000. He will use the balance to transport the items to the bakery. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately SLL 1,486,000. In the future, Mohamed plans to have his own employees so that they can help him to produce more so that he can yield more profit.

Her husband\u2019s salary does not cover all of the expenses.  Her dream is to see her little son in better living conditions than she has had.  That is the reason that she continues working hard so that one day she will be able to achieve that which she so longs for.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons she has made the decision to invest in her business by purchasing products wholesale for her store.  This will allow her to stock her business in order to attract more customers, which will allow her to increase her level of income.\r\n\r\nGiven that she does not have the necessary funds to invest, she has decided to request this loan from Integral.  She will buy the merchandise that she needs like beans, rice, sweets, detergents, oil, coffee, milk, and the other items that will entice customers.  This will allow her to achieve her objective.  This is the way she hopes to fulfill her dream.  She trusts in God Almighty that she will get favorable results. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1043762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beans, rice, sweets, detergents, oil, coffee, and milk, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e1ndida Yibet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.2,"local_amount":71.2,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573678},{"amount":37.45,"local_amount":37.45,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":37.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319256},{"amount":37.91,"local_amount":37.91,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":37.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049550},{"amount":40.08,"local_amount":40.08,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521189},{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":40.73,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":40.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329815},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":42.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349642},{"amount":44.4,"local_amount":44.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321008},{"amount":536.03,"local_amount":536.03,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":536.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929589}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T04:20:23Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:43:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":406334,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a forty-two-year-old married man.

She is married to Ricardo, a mason, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPatricia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPatricia hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1049975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"  To pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T00:00:07Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6797.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998108},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5332.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5437.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606648},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.03,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095505},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2719.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359116}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T02:08:14Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":406227,"name":"Mwarabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwarabu is a 43-year-old married woman.

She is married and has one four year old child.  She has no additional dependents which live with her.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fatmata established her plastic, rubber and glass plate business. She began her business after she completed her diploma in business management and even though she tried hard to find a job she could not. She then decided to establish her own business.  With the experience she has and the qualification, she concluded that she can grow faster so she requested some amount of money from her husband to start her business. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

This will help him target a wider range of people and increase his earnings. In the future, Zouheir plans to buy a minivan to transport more people.

Carla's first business was raising and selling pigs, an activity that she was involved in for 3 years because her parents were owners of a farm, and she always cared for and fed the animals.  After her marriage she became a housewife, and now she sells milk, dairy products and soft drinks.  Her husband helps her with the business, because in order to buy, sell or deliver the milk she has to transport it by motorcycle.  Some of her customers come to the neighborhood where she lives in the city of Leon.  Carla relies on the income her husband earns as a welder and bricklayer.  Her greatest hope is to someday set up a grocery store in her house, because there are few in her neighborhood, and her milk business is only in the morning, which means that in the afternoons she would have the free time to tend to a grocery store.

She is married to Tyron, a messenger, and a mother to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes to expand soon, she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan.

She is a widow and a mother to her two children. She, together with her children, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.              \r\n\r\nMelinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMelinda hopes to have another store in their community, she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

When he started out, he did it with money lent at a high cost, little merchandise, and buying things with high turnover that sold quickly because he had to pay quickly. Almost all of his earnings wound up in other people\u2019s hands. His wife has been his greatest strength. Without her he couldn\u2019t have gotten his work done, because she has helped him in his work, while he simultaneously also works in bricklaying and motorcycle mechanics, among other things that he has learned and which have generated income that have been important for growth. He is now requesting a Kiva loan, his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy grocery items that will diversify his inventory and will guarantee a permanent inventory for responding to his customers\u2019 requests; they often leave dissatisfied because Jader doesn\u2019t have things in his store and this is a big challenge, as is not having sufficient capital.

She is married. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nEmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmelia hopes to grow her business in the coming years.

The  success of her business with her husband is that they continually work as a family.

When she prepared her home two years ago she started a business of decorating shoes with jewels.  She buys them in the center of the city, decorates them, and sells them.  Her clientele has been gradually building between relatives, neighbors, and friends who refer new customers to her.\r\n\r\nShe sells for cash, and she handles a small credit portfolio.  Her goal for later on is to have her own house.  In order to do so she tries hard every day to achieve, through her work, the success of her business. \r\n\r\nShe currently needs working capital to buy slippers, sandals, sweaters, and bermudas.  She will also buy imitation jewels to use as decorative accessories that she will apply to all of these products in order to respond to her growing clientele.  That is why she turns to a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will produce new and creative designs to impact her customers.  She will awaken their attention, interest, and desire.  Then they will buy.  She hypothesizes that this investment will be successful because of her experience in developing the technique and the exclusivity that she generates for each customer upon wearing her goods.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1045913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy slippers, sandals, sweaters, bermudas, and imitation jewels to make decorative accessories to apply to these items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirly   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":550000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40245},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41184},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":42145},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43128},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44134},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45164},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":46218},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":47296},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":48400},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":49529},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50685},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":51872}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":151.27,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":266391.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775012},{"amount":173.73,"local_amount":294000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":305933.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387002}],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T17:25:35Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":406702,"name":"Enebish","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enebish is 62 years old and lives with her husband in a ger (or Mongolian yurt) in Hovd province, Mongolia.

She lives in Bacoor, Cavite City, with her husband Edwin, a laborer, and their three children. The couple manages the family household while operating their businesses.\r\n\r\nNancy works hard in her direct sales business to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then the item is given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Nancy's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNancy hopes to have another branch in the coming years and dreams of ensuring that her children will receive a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and the item is then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of providing all her children with a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php23,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSalvacion hopes her business grows in the coming years.

She has kept the business going with help of three loans that have made it possible for her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nCurrently Rwida is asking for a loan of 80,000 YER from AMB to buy a new sewing machine. This will help her complete client orders on-time and increase her profits. With her current machine, she is unable to finish orders on time. Rwida would like to employ her friends who are currently unemployed in order to open a sewing factory.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1051308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new sewing machine for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noriah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khlod","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ebtsam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rwida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":320000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":32144},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":31984},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":31984}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.68,"local_amount":32144,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":32468.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050562},{"amount":149.92,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072103},{"amount":149.93,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266974},{"amount":149.92,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320312},{"amount":149.92,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341246},{"amount":149.93,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310604},{"amount":149.92,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918937},{"amount":149.93,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331051204},{"amount":149.92,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339441229},{"amount":149.93,"local_amount":31984,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":32306.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993918}],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T00:04:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":404860,"name":"Mirna Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna Guadalupe de cuarenta a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus hijos.

A customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 3,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAna hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Cochabamba, in a town called Entre R\u00edos. He lives with his wife, who sells new clothing for a living. Mario has worked as a locksmith\u2019s assistant for a year and is quite enterprising. He is thinking about opening his own locksmith business in the future. \r\n\r\nMario tells us that when he came to live here his wife had very little merchandise. During the first few years she just worked as a clothing sales assistant and wasn\u2019t able to start her own business because she didn\u2019t have the necessary capital. But she saved up gradually and learnt about the clothing retail business so that she could later start a business in this area. Both of them work very hard to provide for their son.  \r\n\r\nOver time they have managed to save money and have used it to buy a piece of urban land. The loan will be used as commercial capital to increase and diversify their merchandise. They hope that this will initially improve their situation. Eventually Mario would like to build his own house, so he needs to increase his income.
