Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and accessories and also for the maintenance of her motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nChristylyn dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets  with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

He is single and manages his own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJonathan operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Jonathan's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories. His regular customers are the local community. He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nJonathan hopes his business grows more in the coming years.

She is single and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJamela operates a retail business. She buys general merchandise from wholesalers and sells them for little profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothing and similar products. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to her low prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy RTW (ready to wear) products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJamela hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

Her daughter attends school and helps her out as much as possible in her free time.  Her husband has a store where he sells screws and spare parts and among them all they earn income to meet household needs; this is how they\u2019ve managed to raise their children.

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that you can buy, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney (a small bus) down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3500 PHP in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 41,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials such as fabric, thread, and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her everyone in her family a good life through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She promotes her bakery business by word of mouth. \r\nShe buys her ingredients in different wholesale stores, supermarkets and suppliers to buy utensils and ingredients.\r\nWith the loan, she will buy gas, 46 Kg of flour and cake molds, the latter she\u2019ll order from the city of Santiago. \r\nHer business goals are to find an established place where she can prepare and sell her baked goods. \r\nMaria lives with her 2 daughters, 25 and 21, both in university. \r\nOne of her personal goals is to take a baking course to perfect her skills. \r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity afforded her by Fondo Esperanza, as she\u2019ll be able to invest in her business. In terms of the group, she tells us she feels very comfortable as the members are motivated and committed to their businesses. In terms of the training, she has learned new sales and investment strategies. \r\nTalca is part of the region of Maule, which is located in the central area of the country. It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley. In Chile there exists a curious reference to Talca, the saying, \"Talca, Paris y Londres\" (Talca, Paris and London). Among the reasoning for this saying, some think it\u2019s a derivation of something said by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London; when pronounced in Spanish, \u201clooks like\u201d sounds like the word \u201cParis\u201d) because of the abundant fog that covers the Chilean city in winter time, just like the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1050311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy gas, 46 Kg of flour and cake molds, the latter she\u2019ll order from the city of Santiago.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment for their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha dreams of being able to buy another jeepney. She also dreams that her grandchildren will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n<u>Footnote:<\/u>\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1052753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es el capital de trabajo, que ante la demanda del mercado, se torna insuficiente para comprar productos de belleza de calidad inigualable,  que le aseguren la venta, pues sus clientes ya los conocen y eso es lo que ella ha identificado en su experiencia comercial. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 productos de belleza como tintes, champ\u00fa, acondicionador, mascarilla, etc. con los cuales sorprender\u00e1 a sus clientes y garantizar\u00e1n el \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n.","en":"Delys, 28, has an 8-year-old son with whom she dreams about a successful future.  Therefore she works as hard as she can to ensure that in the future she can give him the best living conditions possible.  Delys has a beauty salon where she provides professional services for improving one's image such as hair cuts, massages, coiffure, manicure, pedicure, etc., and she also advises on beauty products, depending on each customer.  Selling the products generates an income used to help with household expenses.  Delys has been able to get ahead with her son with help from her mother.  She has dedicated much time to training and acquiring beauty skills, as well as learning about administration, so she can appropriately manage her business.\r\n\r\nHer salon is well appointed and set up in her mother's house.  Her mother is in the same business and agrees with Delys about her son's well-being.  With her work Delys has been able to buy her own home.  Her goal for the future is to have her own academy to generate stable employment.  The greatest challenge she is up against is working capital, of which there is not enough to meet the market demand as far as buying unequaled, quality products that are sure to be sold is concerned.  She knows her customers well and has been able to determine this from her commercial experience.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a CrediKiva loan to buy beauty products such as hair color, shampoo, conditioner, etc., with which to surprise her customers and guarantee the success of the investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1045796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products such as hair color, shampoo, conditioner, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118452},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123666},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126551},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129504},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132526},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135618},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138783},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":144900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.69,"local_amount":118452,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":119196.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651516},{"amount":70.66,"local_amount":123666,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":124443.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141130},{"amount":72.32,"local_amount":126551,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":127346.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101010},{"amount":74,"local_amount":129504,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":130318.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338631},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":132526,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133359.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395196},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":135618,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":136470.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775004},{"amount":79.3,"local_amount":138783,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":139655.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386996},{"amount":82.8,"local_amount":144900,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":145810.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993860}],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T13:33:49Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":406472,"name":"Bertin","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Bertin est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 42 ans.

Saliva hopes that in the future he will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nSaliva is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Saliva who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but whose businesses have grown too large for micro-finance

She is married to Prudencio, a transport operator, and they have one child. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, Liezel is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLiezel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Liezel is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLiezel hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

With this business Nuris joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation 4 years ago.

She is a widow and mother to her three children. She, together with her children, manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngelina operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelina hopes to give her children a good future and a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1052839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Ella es una mujer  que tiene 6 hijos en las edades de 26 a 31 a\u00f1os y entre ellos hay dos pares de mellos;  todos ellos son su alegr\u00eda y sue\u00f1a con que cada d\u00eda de su vida prosperen paso a paso.  En sus 16 a\u00f1os de experiencia ha trabajado mucho, inicialmente antes de dedicarse a esta actividad comercial,  trabaj\u00f3 empleada en una familia, pero cuando crecieron sus hijos no quisieron que ella continuara en esta actividad; as\u00ed fue como con el producto de su liquidaci\u00f3n, invirti\u00f3 en prendas que vendi\u00f3 entre sus amigas y con las cuales les fue muy bien y con ellas logr\u00f3 hacer crecer su mercado y logr\u00f3 diversificar su oferta. Sus compras las hace en el centro de la ciudad cuando hay ofertas  importantes, promociones y saldos,  que le salen a un mejor precio. Por eso cuando las vende le gana dinero, sin recargar tanto a sus clientes, que le compran a cr\u00e9dito. En su negocio dos de sus hijos recuperan su cartera, contribuyendo as\u00ed con el desempe\u00f1o del negocio. Sonia tambi\u00e9n tiene otra actividad productiva, pues compra galones de arequipes de 2 a tres veces por semana y los envasa en porciones unitarias en vasos de una onza. Este \u00faltimo negocio ha tenido mucha acogida entre sus clientes, que los compran como golosinas para que sus hijos dispongan de ellas y se deleiten. La familia que Sonia conforma con sus hijos es muy unida, por eso en cada paso que da ella es respaldada; con ellos  comparte gastos y le ayudan en todo. En su venta de arequipe no necesita de activos fijos, pues no maneja inventarios. Como Sonia es una mujer tan cociente de la oportunidad tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de frituras, que traslada a otro barrio donde tiene un punto de ventas,  atendido por uno de sus hijos y estos son ingresos adicionales que tambi\u00e9n recibe. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanc\u00edas variadas en promoci\u00f3n. Su credikiva es una inversi\u00f3n exitosa,  porque le permite tener un dinero disponible para responder a pedidos, ya que  los plazos otorgados a sus clientes,  muchas veces no le facilitan el dar una respuesta oportuna a los nuevos compradores a cr\u00e9dito y esto con su credikiva ser\u00e1 posible.  \n\n","en":"Sonia, 52, sells clothes and underwear and also has a business selling \u201cdulce de leche\u201d or \u201carequipe\u201d [caramel].  She has six children whose ages range between 26 and 31 years; among them is a pair of twins.  All of them are her joy and she dreams that they will make progress step by step every day of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn her 16 years of experience she has worked very hard.  Initially before going into this commercial activity, she worked as a domestic employee for a family but when her children grew up they didn\u2019t want her to continue with this activity so she used the money she got from her severance pay and bought some articles of clothing that she sold among her friends.  She did very well with them and managed to increase her market and to diversify her offer.\r\n\r\nShe does her purchases in the center of the city when there are important sales, promotions and close-out sales that mean better prices.  This way when she sells them she earns money without having to charge her customers who buy on credit so much.  Two of her children help out collecting payment thus contributing to the business\u2019 operation.\r\n\r\nSonia has an additional productive activity because she buys gallons of arequipe twice or three times a week that she repackages in single serving containers of one ounce each.

Her arequipe sales don\u2019t require fixed assets since she keeps no standing inventory.\r\n\r\nBecause Sonia is aware of opportunities, she also sells fried fast food that she takes to a different neighborhood where she has a sales point one of her children tends to and this is additional income she also receives.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she will use to buy assorted merchandise that\u2019s on special promotion.  Her Kiva loan is a successful investment because it allows her to have money on hand to respond to orders because the time frame she offers her customers sometimes prevents her from being able to respond in a timely fashion to new credit customers and with the Kiva loan this will be possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1050656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted merchandise that's on special promotion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63487},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70568},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72215},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73900},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75624},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77389},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79195},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87622}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":63487,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":65142.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651556},{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":70568,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":72408.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101026},{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":72215,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":74098.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338648},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":73900,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75827.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395212},{"amount":42.49,"local_amount":72845,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":74745.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775021},{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":80168,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":82259.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387012},{"amount":97.31,"local_amount":166817,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":171168.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993874}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T16:42:21Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":406573,"name":"20 De Julio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"20 de julio es el grupo formado por 20 mujeres de la ciudad de Asunci\u00f3n, ellas son personas muy trabajadoras y emprendedoras que siempre se esfuerzan al m\u00e1ximo para poder ayudar a sus familias y sus hijos.

 Elvira nunca se imagin\u00f3, que lo que inici\u00f3 por seguirle  la corriente a unas amigas,  que la invitaron a que se capacitara t\u00e9cnicamente en artesan\u00edas, hoy se convertir\u00eda en su actividad generadora de ingresos.  En la actualidad sus amigas abandonaron esta tarea y Elvira est\u00e1 concentrada en trabajar en las artesan\u00edas y como alternativa adicional tambi\u00e9n hace pedicure y manicures, porque hace todos los cursos que cree le van a servir,  para deleitarse adem\u00e1s de producirle dinero. Su meta mas adelante es tener su propia casa y en ella un local, donde ubicar sus artesan\u00edas,  surgida de un potencial que no hab\u00eda explorado. En la actualidad est\u00e1 entusiasmada con su negocio y planea hacer un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materiales para elaborar camisetas, pinturas, pinceles, pegantes, sellantes, jeans y tela para trabajar nuevos dise\u00f1os.

","en":"Forty-five-year-old Elvira lives with her spouse and her three children, who range from 14 to 24 years old, in one of the most cheerful neighborhoods that celebrates Carnival in the city.  That is where she has her business making and designing dolls, decorating blouses, and making layettes.  Elvira never imagined that what she started to humor some friends who invited her to train in craft-making technique would today be the business that generates her income.  Now, her friends no longer do this kind of work and Elvira concentrates on working in craft-making and, as an extra alternative, she also gives manicures and pedicures because she takes all the courses that she thinks will be useful to her to enjoy herself and make money too.  Her goal for the future is to have her own home and to set up a store in it where she can keep her crafts, which is a potential she has yet to explore.  At the moment she is enthusiastic about her business and plans to take out a Kiva loan, which will be her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Using this loan, she will buy materials to make blouses, paint, paintbrushes, glue, stamps, jeans, and fabric to work on new designs.

She tells us that her age hasn't been an obstacle to allowing her to set goals for herself and become independent, rather she has taken advantage of her youth to have a bright future.  She currently works as a receptionist in one of her country's state businesses, but her salary is not sufficient to cover her expenses as everything has gone up.  That is why she currently has a business in her own home in the form of renting out two rooms.  This business has generated extra income for her in addition to her salary and the support she receives from her husband.  As this is her first loan cycle, she explains that her reason for taking out this loan is to fit out the rooms she rents with the goal of having them be her main source of income.  Also, by offering her tenants better conditions, she will be able to increase rent.  Her plan for the future is to finish her studies and become a certified accountant in order to seek out better employment

\"Talca looks like London\" [Spanish \"parece\" 'looks like' and \"Par\u00eds\" 'Paris' sound alike] because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1050808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She has also expanded to other regions of the country from where she brings a variety of merchandise such as clothing, shoes, bags, etc.  Her merchandise is exclusive, and is not very cheap.

She works in the preparation and sales of food delivered to homes, a business she started 6 years ago. She was making lunch for her daughter every day and her daughter\u2019s friends liked the food she was preparing, so they convinced Fanny to make them their lunch, too. Little by little, other companies joined in and now she has over 45 fixed clients per day. Since she sells on credit, she\u2019s not able to buy ingredients in large quantities, so she has to go to the market every two days, which increases her transportation costs. She\u2019s requesting a Kiva loan, her 1st one with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy rice, oil, meats and other ingredients in large volume so she can diminish the frequency of shopping trips and still have a large inventory of products to offer her customers \u2013 this is why the loan will be a

This city is known for its beautiful landscape and for its freshwater pools which are very popular with tourists. \r\n\r\nHere we meet 57-year-old Neffer who is married and has four children who are already grown up and no longer dependent on her.  Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nNeffer is a great homemaker who also raises chickens so that she can earn some money herself.  She has a small farm where she keeps 200 chickens a season.  Seasons can last two or three months.  She also raises Creole hens which she sells for a better price than the normal farmyard chickens because their flavor is delicious.

The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up capital and re-startup credits with generous conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Medea will purchase a pig, which will give her at least 12 piglets per year. She will raise the piglets and breed the pigs in the farm. Later, additional piglets will be sold and the income of the family will significantly increase: in fact, it is expected to double. The living conditions of the family will improve.

With the received credit, Zviad will build a greenhouse. He will grow greens and vegetables there during the whole year, which will be sold at the local open market.

They have a milk cow, the dairy products from which are mainly consumed by the family members.  The small surplus is sold in the village. Also the family owns 150 nut trees and they sell nuts in season. The total average monthly income for this 6-member family is 300 Laris, including the monthly pension of Ramaz\u2019s mother. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the rural poor. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested credit to purchase 2 hectares of land.  His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ramaz will purchase 2 hectares of land. He will sow maize on the land every year and sell the harvest in the fall.  The income for the family will double and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions significantly. In the future, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital

She lives in a small village in Akhmeta District. Maya isn\u2019t married; she lives with her mother, brother, and aunt. Maya\u2019s mother is retired; her aunt has health problems and gets a monthly pension as a person with disabilities. Maya and her brother grow vegetables on a family-owned plot of land. Most of these vegetables are consumed by the family. The family's average monthly income is 170 GEL. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nMaya used to run a trade business. She imported clothing from a neighboring country and sold it in Kakheti region. She sold directly to consumers, as well as to local clothing stores. But because of a shortage of turnover, she stopped the business. Maya requested credit for re-starting it. Her loan request was approved under the guidelines of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans for business start-up and re-startup to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit. They are often regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit Maya will purchase clothing from her old suppliers in Turkey and sell it in Kakheti stores and to the local population. The income of the family will increase by 300 \u2013 350 GEL, which is an increase of approximately 200%. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve and they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1052842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The town's economy is currently based on services, farming, transport, agribusiness, tourism and commerce."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5400,"image":{"id":1050561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tablecloths and a machine for performing skin massages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Casablanca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T22:10:04Z","loan_amount":5400,"lender_count":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ercilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2595196,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":174168},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":175826},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177501},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":179194},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":180902},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182630},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":184374},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":186133},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":187911},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":188379},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":192558},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":193335},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":195182},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":197103}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":376.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":728.26,"local_amount":349994,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":351310.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031519},{"amount":1882.26,"local_amount":904601,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":908004.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643696},{"amount":1570.94,"local_amount":754981,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":757821.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283324279},{"amount":1218.54,"local_amount":585620,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":587823.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430128}],"funded_date":"2012-03-28T02:37:25Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:57:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":407578,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet wants a loan to buy sodas and sugar to sell.
