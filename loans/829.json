En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer credikiva, tambi\u00e9n primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 material reciclable en mayor cantidad,como cobre, aluminio, lata, acero, bronce, cart\u00f3n, para atender la demanda de su clientela; el \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n radica en que la venta est\u00e1 garantizada y que responder\u00e1n oportunamente a su mercado, pues hay veces se quedan cortos ante la demanda de sus clientes.  ","en":"Francisco, 44, lives with his spouse; they have five children whose ages range from 10 to 25 years.  He owns a recycling center that\u2019s been in operation about three years and which arose through his spouse\u2019s initiative and is located in a small town near the city of Barranquilla.  He works there with his spouse and his father-in-law selling copper, aluminum, tin, steel, bronze, cardboard and other types of recyclable materials.  With his sales that are mainly to two important clients in the city he\u2019s able to cover family and operational costs.  He currently has no passives but has some basic fixed assets that are necessary for his business.  His goal for later on is to have a truck of his own to transport the recycled materials but his working capital is insufficient at the moment to reach it.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s currently applying for his first Kiva loan which is also his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that he\u2019ll use to buy recyclables in larger amounts like copper, aluminum, tin, steel, bronze and cardboard to meet customer demand.  Success of the investment rests on the fact that his sale is guaranteed and they will be able to respond to their market in an opportune way because sometimes they fall short of meeting customer demand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1051811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Jaime, a driver, and the mother of three children, all of whom are studying. She keeps herself busy attending to her kids and running a business that will help to sustain their daily expenses. \n\nTeresita operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat only home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to pay for cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Aside from this, she also sells silver accessories and processed meat for additional income.She also operates a jeepney unit. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and also frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nTeresita dreams of a good future for all her children. She wants her business to grow and have more customers. She hopes that her faith in God will continue to grow.  She faithfully attends the weekly fellowship* meetings because she wants to know more about Christ Jesus.  \n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1048359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T23:00:09Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3578.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998086},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2147.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606626},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3579.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095483},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359095}],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T01:37:58Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":406930,"name":"Virgen De Lourdes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Virgen de Lourdes se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas y amigas de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed.

She is married to Santiago, a heavy equipment operator, and she is the mother of their children. By the grace of God, Leonora has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. \n\nLeonora oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have two units of jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying them a boundary (daily quota) each day. Their regular customers are students and employees in the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in boundary every day. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and maintenance of her jeepney units. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nLeonora dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n \n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n

years old. She is raising a daughter who attends third grade. For 15 years, Kuljan has been operating a cafe, having started her business with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS).

He resides in the municipality of Galapa along with his wife and one son who is 11 years old. His experience dates back approximately 21 years, when he learned this business from his father. In his business he sells gels, talcum powder, soaps, toothpaste and personal grooming products in general, to customers in the city of Santa Marta and in the municipality of Galapa, in quantities such as by the dozen and by the box. His market is made up especially of shops and general stores and the occasional housewife, who are constantly placing orders to which Dorian must respond in a timely manner in order to be successful. \r\n\r\nWith the sales from his business, he covers his operating costs and household expenses, leaving a small profit margin which he invests in small quantities of products. However it is not sufficient for him to invest in larger volumes and expand his customer base. Thus he has turned to a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, through which he will purchase soaps, gels and personal grooming products.

Jackline is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are both currently in school. For the past two years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her retail shop which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay some school fees for her children. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a car for herself. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training. The ELA program has improved Jackline's future prospects by helping her learn how to save her money."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1053061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For the past three years, Ruth has been working hard to manage her small market selling food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase stock in her business and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and for her medical expenses. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training. The ELA program has improved Ruth's future prospects by helping her to get a loan at her age. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Agness is 22 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fortpotal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past four years, Agness has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells row food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agness has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda.

This area is known for its beautiful beaches, its cuisine and the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Ana Mar\u00eda.  She is 63 years old, married, and has four children who are all now grown up and independent.  Her husband is a shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nMore than ten years ago, in order to earn a living and provide for their family on a daily basis, Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband used a small amount of money they had to set up a small grocery store in their home.  They started out with very little but now, thanks to loans, they have been able to expand the business and, as time has gone by, they have also added school supplies and some homeware products.  Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband work every day, from 6.00am to 8.00pm.  In some seasons their sales increase a lot but in others not so much.  However, all the same, it makes them enough to support themselves.  They are already elderly and this is how they provide for themselves.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda would like to invest this loan in buying more products so that she can grow her store.  She will buy rice, sugar, meat, fish and other basic household products.  She has been a member of her community bank since the beginning and she likes it because of how easy it is to obtain loans.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda's dreams are to have a much larger store and for herself and her family to enjoy good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1052233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, meat, fish and other basic household products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-27T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-26T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":618.75,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":618.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646295},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321374},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208971},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335286}],"funded_date":"2012-03-31T12:18:08Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":407819,"name":"Margot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margot has a shop where she sews and sells curtains made to order for her customers.

She is married to Alba Jhasmany and the couple have a 10-year-old daughter together.  Their daughter is in elementary school.  Amanda lives in the community of La Maica, south of Cochabamba.  She lives in her parents' home because her house is still being built.  Her parents gave her a plot of land as an inheritance and that is where she is building her home.  Right now the three of them live in just one room where they are all very uncomfortable.  Amanda's main business activity is selling food such as 'chicharr\u00f3n de cerdo' (seasoned pork ribs cooked in fat and beer) which is a traditional regional dish, as well as duck, rabbit, etc.  She carries out her work every weekend, from Friday to Monday.  Her husband works every day as a taxi driver.  In this way, the two of them work toward finishing the building of their house.\r\n\r\nAmanda's previous loan helped her a lot because she was able to use it to buy 10 pigs at a very low price when that opportunity presented itself.  This enabled her to increase her income.  She feels very happy because, with the profits, she managed to make quite a bit of progress in building her house.  This new loan will also be used to buy at least 20 pigs.  This will allow her to have enough in stock so that she can continue making her 'chicharr\u00f3n de cerdo' as this is the business activity that makes her the most profits. Cooking is what Amanda does best and so her future goals and dreams include owning a large restaurant where she can prepare her delicious dishes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":760432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She displays her items in the military camps among her peers, as well as at the Katindo public market.  Her husband is a military officer. \n\nWith the profit, she is able to save, buy food and support her children's education. However, she has just received her fifteenth loan from Hekima.

She is married to Arnel, her business partner, and she is mother to their seven children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNorania operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sells them for a little profit. Her products are pants, clothes and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNorania hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

She breeds cattle, sheep, and keeps bees and chickens in the Shishkert village.  She also grows vegetables and fruits.  Lamara sells the agricultural products, such as beef, lamb, milk, honey, eggs, wool, vegetables and fruits, obtained from her farm, to stores in the city of Kapan and, thus, supports her family. \r\nLamara is 49 years old and lives in the Shishkert village of the Syunik region.  She graduated from a nutrition college, but was unable to get a job because she got married and had three children.  Lamara's daughters are already married and live separately from the parents, and her son recently returned from the army, and now helps his mother on the farm.  Lamara's husband works as a machinist at a hydropower station and helps Lamara to run the agricultural business in his free time.  \r\nLamara needs a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 dram to purchase several piglets for her farm, several new beehives, and frames for honey and wax.

Another of her main goals is for all the members of her group to help each other, work as a team and be supportive of each other through their Women's Bank.\n\nIt is important to note that this group initially had 9 clients, which is why there are three extra women in the photo. However, those three women decided to form their own group, so only 6 women will be investing in agricultural activities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1048974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy pigs, concentrated feed and vitamins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Roxana, L\u00edmon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-03-27T21:03:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-26T21:03:09Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anabelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":714285.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":785714.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1558.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1416.7,"local_amount":714300,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":717697.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308405505},{"amount":1558.3,"local_amount":785700,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":789437.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356499257}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T20:17:30Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:45:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":409271,"name":"Svetlana","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430. \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 -

Additionally, Mary Jane's success has enabled her to care for and educate her three children. Mary Jane is very grateful for your support. \r\n\r\nRecently she requested a loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 for her other line of business, a general store locally known as a \"sari-sari store\". The amount requested will be used to purchase more grocery goods to sell. Doing these kinds of businesses is of great help in the family. The return is good enough to sustain their daily needs. Furthermore, with this business she was able to earn 7,460 PHP a month.

She is married to John Carlo, her business partner, and she is a mother to her four children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Nenita earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Nenita earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Nenita is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

For a number of years, Ludis has been cultivating cassava.  He's been affected the most by heavy downpours that destroyed his crops, literally leaving nothing left of his cultivations.  But thanks to the support that Afodenic has provided him, through Kiva, he managed to put in a quarter of a manzana  (about half an acre) of squash.  In this way he managed to pay off his loan and continue working as a farmer, because he supports his family with the sale of his crops.  Now he needs to buy cassava stalks so that he can go back to growing this crop.  He will also buy fertilizers and other supplies that he needs to control any pests that appear.  In the future, he will also harvest two varieties of squash, because these varieties tend to grow very well during the winter season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1053200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-03-28T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-27T04:40:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludis Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15094.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356436324}],"funded_date":"2012-04-21T20:39:45Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:07:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":407984,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Janet, 39, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She expects a boost in her income as she expands.  Emelia hopes to expand her business in the coming year and give her children a high-quality education through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories about her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.

She needs the loan to stock her business with more and more varied products such as: sugar, milk, rice, lard, beans, soap, detergent, dairy products, drinks, churros, candies, etc. She hopes that with this loan her income will grow and she will be able to support her granddaughter and also make her payments on time.

20-year-old. He is a living example that despite the pains and problems than may come our way, you keep going. Five years ago he became a widower. His wife had an illness from which she could not recover. He then became father and mother to his daughter, who is now 26 years old. He struggles every day to provide a better future for her and so that she will be proud of him. He also wants to show her that with sacrifice everyone can improve his life. He lives and works in the city of Pisco in San Andr\u00e9s district, where the beaches are beautiful. One of the district's principle activities is fishing, which is Pedro's occupation.\r\n\r\nPedro works from morning to night as a fisherman and specializes in catching shellfish. He gets up at dawn to go out in his boat. He learned to fish at a very early age from his father, which encouraged him to become a fisherman. He believes that his business is going well because God is always with him. He also has an angel, his wife, at his side watching him; so he goes out each day with a great deal of faith. \r\n\r\nPedro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders whose support will let him do maintenance on his on-board air compressor and motor. This will mean his boat will be safer and he can avoid accidents that would be regrettable. He then will keep working each day to achieve his great dream: \u201dto give his daughter a profession and improve her quality of
