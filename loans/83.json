Due to the lack of jobs in his town, Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to provide for his family Amriddin started his own business selling sewing machines and supplies (needle, thread, and other small items) about 14 years ago. He has become well-known in his town, and his sales have increased. To continue growing his business, Amriddin is requesting a loan in the amount of $1300 to purchase more merchandise to offer customers greater variety and quality of products and to provide better customer service.

He and his family thank you very much! \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; its role in ending Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous cultural figures, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, modern Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war that began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged Tajikistan's already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition to potential lenders. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 45 years old, married and a father of three children between the ages 16 and 22, two of them students. He finished 7th grade but had to drop school to start working and help his parents. He lives with his wife, children and stepdaughter at their house in the district of Boane. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Maputo in 1981 and lived with his uncle and aunt, trying to find better life conditions. Soon after that he got a job and got married in 1992. He's been working as a typist for over 23 years, and makes 2.895,00 (about U$105) per month. With this money he supports his family, builds his house and pays loans. \r\n\r\nThis is Rom\u00e3o's third loan, in the amount of $375, which he'll use to buy construction supplies. His first loans were for the same purpose, in the amounts of $110 and $220. He's committed to pay this loan like he's paid the ones in the past. He dreams of seeing his house finished.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Lagomau  has 6 years of experience in this business.  Lagomau  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 162 tala or US $68 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lagomau  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagomau 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagomau  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.87 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.56 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 37 years old, and a single father of two children who are 12 and 3 years old. The eldest attends school. Fernando only completed the first grade, and didn't continue due to lack of resources and the negligence of his parents. He lives with his children in his own home, and also supports a brother who lives with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Maputo with his mother after she left his father, and they relocated their residence to Boane. He currently lives in this district and has owned his own shop for over 17 years. He works from 7 am until 9 pm, and mainly sells beer and soft drinks. He has no employees. \r\n\r\nHe earns around 1000 MZN a day, and uses the money for household expenses and saves some through a Xitique (a traditional savings system). He's never taken out a loan with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through his friend Mr. Antonio Mundlovu who is also a client of the organization. This is his fourth loan, and is in the amount of 17000 MZN. He plans to use the money to purchase products (beer, wine, soft drinks and others) to increase the quality of the merchandise in his establishment. The earlier loans were for 8000 MZN, 12000 MZN and 15000 MZN, and were all used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to apply for additional loans to increase the size of his commercial establishment and provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

In sales she does very well and has fifteen years with this business, initially she sold on credit but didn't make a profit and now her sales are only in cash and because of this she makes a better profit. Rosa is very happy with her business, because it generates good profits and what calls attention to her business is that she has friends and acquaintances who she talks with and is entertained by. From now on she plans to rent a stall in the market and she wishes to avoid the constant risk of transporting her merchandise. This is her thrity-second loan with MFP and she agrees to the commitment to continue making payments punctually.

is married and has one grown daughter. For a while she worked as a trolley-bus controller selling tickets to passengers. She also worked part-time as a market vendor. However, Galina wanted to be self-employed, so six years ago she decided to start her own business. Today she has four market vending facilities \u2013 two selling dishware sets and ceramics, and two locations selling clothing and shoes. She has hired several employees who help her with sales. \r\n<p>\r\nGalina realizes that lending services have been the engine pushing her business forward. The seventeen loans she has received and repaid from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped her business grow. With financial assistance Galina was able to purchase two more vending facilities and hire two people to work for her. Currently, she has about $8,000 in inventory. Her monthly gross revenue amounts to $2,000.\r\n<p>\r\nGalina has requested a loan of $1,200 to open her fifth vending facility and start selling dishware and ceramic goods in a new location. She is planning to buy tableware, dinnerware and porcelain sets at wholesale prices that she can re-sell in her new kiosk. Galina is hoping that the expansion of her trade will help her meet high demand for dishware and boost her sales.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Hamtic is situated to the south of Antique, and is bounded by mountains in one direction and the coast in the other.  Evelyn is 38 years old and has two sons and two daughters.  Her eldest child, a daughter, is 14 and attends high school; the other three children are still in primary school.  Evelyn's husband Alexius is a driver.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn plans to use the money from this loan to buy inventory for her sari-sari store.  \"Sari-sari\" is Tagalog for \"various kinds\" and the shops sell just that: an assortment of basic foodstuffs, beverages, and everyday commodities. The shops retail items in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example. Sari-sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, especially in poor or rural areas; they often have chairs or a bench out front and act as neighborhood watering holes.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn dreams that one day perhaps she'll be able to grow her sari-sari store into a mini-mart.

She lives with her husband, a jeepney driver and mechanic, and their three school-aged children. Sittinona's family is also one of the earliest recipients of a row-house unit in the Habitat for Humanity Housing Project, in BASECO Compound, Port Area, Manila.\n\nSittinona started a small general store in 2003. When she joined CCT in 2005, she was able to keep her store going and growing. The store, located at the heart of the Habitat and near the school, caters to customers from all over. Sittinona took advantage of its location near the school by adding school supplies to satisfy the high demand from elementary students at a nearby school. Sittinona will use this loan to expand the inventory in her store.\n\nJust last year, Sittinona received another heaven-sent blessing \u2013 she and her husband were able to buy a passenger jeepney, which her husband drives every day. They use their combined income from the store and the jeepney's daily income to support the education of their three children.

Narantsetseg started her business in 1995 with her capital of 300,000 tugrugs. She has gained much selling experience and knowledge of her trade over the years, and attributes her success to her good accounting skills. Today, her working capital exceeds 700,000 tugrugs. In the future, she hopes to grow her business and move out of her shipping container, which is a very uncomfortable workplace. She says, \"I hope to own a stall in the trading center where I can work comfortably.\" She also plans to use her future earnings to remodel her house.

She came to know about Hluvuku through her cousin who is also a member. This loan, in the amount of 25.000.00mt, is her third. She intends to building materials (screens, beams, cement and others) to continue building her house. The previous loans were for 6.000.00mt and15.000.00mt and were used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe makes a commitment to pay this loan on time, to be able to be granted further credit.

She raises and sells birds, like chickens, ducks, and other types of fowl.  She also sells breakfast at the market in the morning.  She prepares humitas (flavored corn paste wrapped in corn leaves) and tamales when they are requested.  She works very hard because she would like to invest in her children's occupation.  \r\n\r\nSebastiana has raised and sold pigs for many years with her small income.

They will use the money to pay loan interest and day-to-day family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":567464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy fertilizer, seed and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Tion","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":220000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":220000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":221294.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917830}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T19:26:52Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Briggs","image":983838}},{"id":218309,"name":"Aidah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aidah is married with five children and all of them are at school.

He works hard in both jobs to be able to meet the family's financial needs. \r\n\r\nToday, he is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l so he can buy a car.

She believes that her entrepreneurial skills, land, good climate and a constant desire to learn something new will push the level of the business upward. The only thing she lacks is financial capital. For this reason she gathered a group of ambitious private entrepreneurs like her and applied for a loan from Kiva, cooperating with its field partner in Kyrgyzstan Mol Bulak Finance. \r\n\r\nNazira will start with the purchase of 500 kg of potato seeds. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Now he is working hard to be able to offer his wife a better quality of life and to have a quiet retirement.  Segundo's work is repairing and maintaining air conditioners.  He generally works with a few public and private institutions, but when he's not working he's usually at home fixing things.  He's always waiting for his cell or home phone to ring because when it does it's because a customer needs him to go to his house or office to repair an air system.  He has been in this business for 31 years, during which he has gained experience and improved his technique.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have free time to spend at home and it also makes him good money because in his area the heat is intense and there are a lot of air conditioning systems, which mean a big market for him.  He is currently at the stage where he is expanding his business, as he wants to not only do repairs, but also to sell replacement parts for these products.  This will be his sixth loan with MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have the financial support to increase his working capital.

All of her businesses help to meet their daily expenses, but she is requesting a new loan to buy additional goods for her variety store as well as rice for resale.\r\n\r\nIsabel's hope is that her

The way she treats her customers is the best and all her neighbors buy from her. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to supply more merchandise such as eggs, milk, cream, bread, refreshments, Sabritas, canned chiles, sugar, etc.  Her goal for the future is to be able to give a better quality of life to her children and continue supporting them in their studies. \r\nMs. Amalia tells us that she likes her group because they support her and she likes the idea of working with FRAC and Kiva and because the interest is very low.

Beatriz makes a living selling dairy products. She has six heads of cattle to produce the milk, which she sells in order to help the household income. Her husband makes a living in agriculture, harvesting carrots, onion and potatoes, which Beatriz then sells in the town of Santiva\u00f1ez, 20 minutes outside of Londo and an hour from the city of Cochabamba.

While they have found professionals to help their son, they cannot pay for the treatment, which is why they have requested a loan so they increase their income and cover the expenses. Beatrix plans to use the loan to purchase another head of cattle to increase her income. In this way she can pay off the specialists who are helping her young son.

Ella ha tenido su negocio por alrededor de 1 a\u00f1os, el cual inici\u00f3 con un peque\u00f1o capital que fue ahorrando mientras realizaba otros tipo de negocio. Kenia est\u00e1 planificando invertir su nuevo pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de Sacos de Arroz, azucar, harina, habichuelas, entre otros alimentos. Ella va a utilizar sus ganancias para reinvertir en su negocio, le gusta leer y su reto mas dificil ha sido estudiar. Su m\u00e1s grande sue\u00f1o es poder convertirse en una profesional.","en":"Kenia operates one of our small businesses.  She has a store--called a \"colmado\" in the Dominican Republic--where she sells the common food items that her customers need to make their daily meals.  It's a small store in the city of San Pedro de Macoris where she lives.  The city is famous for its sugar industry and the soccer balls that are made here.  The economy depends on a free trade zone, the cement industry and other activities such as tourism.  Kenia came to us because she needed to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nKenia is really excited to receive this, her fifth Esperanza Internacional loan, after having successfully repaid past loans and making great strides in growing her business.  She started the business a year ago with money that she managed to save while working at another business.  She plans to use this new loan to buy sacks of rice, sugar, flour and beans, among other things.  She will reinvest her earnings in the business.  Kenia likes to read and her most difficult challenge has been to go to school.  She would like to make herself over for a professional career."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":618509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2397.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2443.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2567.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2624.98},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2719.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2896.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2923.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3047.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3138.98},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3264.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3370.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3492.48},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":112.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.94},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":2397.85,"processed_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2444.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177395518},{"amount":68.07,"local_amount":2443.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2491.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534044},{"amount":71.52,"local_amount":2567.31,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670812},{"amount":250.24,"local_amount":8982.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9158.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414181},{"amount":124.15,"local_amount":4456.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991064},{"amount":130.02,"local_amount":4667.23,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4758.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275137},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":4786.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4880.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142430},{"amount":130.86,"local_amount":4697.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4789.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215479}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T19:11:39Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":242915,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine N. lives in the Mulago neighborhood in the city of Kampala, Uganda.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Mirna has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mirna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mirna is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Mirna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Shahodat is 37 years old. She lives in Isfara town and is married with four adorable children. For a long time her husband couldn\u2019t find a job, so he had to leave for Russia to earn money. For the last 6 months since her husband left, she has been the only breadwinner in her family. <p>\r\nShahodat is a very hardworking and independent woman. For more than 6 years, she has sold dried apricots in the central local market. She is very experienced in this business. As a rule, she purchases apricots in the market and dries them herself, with the help of her oldest son. Because she buys apricots wholesale, her prices are lower than regular market prices.

This is 35-year-old Hamisa R. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.)  Hamisa is married and has 3 children between the ages of 7 and 12. \r\n<p>\r\nSince 2006, Hamisa has been selling traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called vitenge. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with a wax print that is printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.  Hamisa works at her business 1 to 4 hours a day and is assisted by her sister. \r\n<p>\r\nHamisa currently earns about $25 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to expand her business by purchasing additional vitenge in bulk, and to diversify her business by purchasing shoes and kanga. A kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its colorful pattern in frames. A kanga is a very useful item because it can be used as as either a wrap-around or a towel. Hamisa thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Teopista works seven days per week in a semi-urban area (in the outskirts of Kampala), and she averages approximately 20 customers per day.  She explains that she sells to all categories of customers (i.e., retail and wholesale customers), and that she incurs transportation costs when buying chicken feed and feeding trays.  Her major business challenges are the ever-increasing prices of chicken feed and chickens in Uganda.  She has been in this business for over 20 years, and she has been with MCDT for eight years.  Notably, this would be Teopista's twentieth loan via MCDT.  Teopista joined MCDT because it was near her home, and because it was an easy organization to work with.  She would like to use this loan to buy more sacks of chicken feed and chickens.

She is now 54 years old, and a widow. Her four children are grown and do not live with her.  She has been a business woman for 15 years, having begun by selling tortillas, then growing her clientele because of her strong customer service. With her earnings and the help of her husband, she was able to pick up a plot of land.  Estefana is also a seamstress (suits, dresses, pants, etc.).  She operates her store, known as \"Tienda Buenos Aires,\" out of her home, located in the Villa Lobos 2 section of Villa Nueva.  She sells soft drinks, bottled water, and groceries.  When sales are down, she sells food and makes clothing.  Her goal is to have some working capital.  Her dream is to finish building her house.  Estefana is very grateful to FAPE, an organization that has given her moral and financial support to improve her life.  She has worked with FAPE for 2 years, and has paid off three loans.  She now needs another loan to buy Christmas merchandise, since sales are up during the season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":454958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"sales of water and gas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Villa Lobos II, Villa Nueva","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2009-12-22T19:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estefana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":866.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118068331},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":866.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128938122},{"amount":416.66,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3465.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144699152}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T00:32:07Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:11:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":168605,"name":"Lesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lesa I. is 45 and married with 8 children (ages 2 - 29).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lesa has many years of experience in this business.  Lesa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 tala or US $146 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lesa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lesa I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He aims to carry out his work with great care and efficiency so that his customers continue to choose him for their repair needs.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of time he has been in business, his tools are deteriorating and can no longer be used.  For this reason, Julio finds himself having to appeal to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1,500 Peruvian soles.  He plans to invest the loan into purchasing new tools to replace the old ones, and therefore be able to more efficiently continue with his work.\r\n\r\nJulio is a person who very much enjoys his line of business and, because of this, he has given it a great deal of dedication so it will continue to grow.  His greatest wish is to start an enterprise selling replacement car parts.  He has worked with our institution previously, and has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility from the moment he assumes his installment payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":525637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new tools for his auto repair workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Motupe -

Most recently, he added new sound equipment for vehicles, loudspeakers, power plants.\r\n\r\nThis is his 2nd loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He used his previous loan to stock his business.  He was able to pay cash for the merchandise and add cameras to his stock, something he hadn\u2019t sold previously.  This led to higher profits and still more benefits for his home; he was able to provide a few treats for the family and this always means moments of happiness.  He wants to make it clear that all this is possible thanks to the help he gets from his daughter who also works and contributes to the household support.\r\n\r\nWith his Kiva loan he will buy more technologically advanced cell phones, like MP4s and MP5s as well as car radios with DVDs included.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to always invest in items that are most profitable and that he get satisfaction from selling them and meeting his financial obligations in a responsible manner.\r\n\r\nHis challenge now is to increase his profits so that he can help his son with his schooling so that his future

After earning a degree in Animal Care in England, he joined the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus as head elephant trainer. Many cities and towns later, Mike moved to California and switched to horses. \r\n\r\nToday Mike drives from farm to farm as a farrier, a blacksmith who specializes in horse care. His business is about three years old and very busy. Horses need new shoes every 5-8 weeks, and with a limited number of farriers in the area, Mike is constantly responding to calls. \r\n\r\nAfter his bank told him that his loan request was too small, Mike was referred to Opportunity Fund. \"The loan process at Opportunity Fund was way easier than I thought it would be.\"  Mike will use a $10,000 loan to purchase a customized farrier trailer to transport his equipment from farm to farm. \"This way, if my truck breaks down, I won't miss a day of work.\"

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the town of Bougouni (Sikasso region). \r\n\r\nShe abandoned school early on in favor of income-generating activities, notably the buying and selling of fruits and vegetables such as bananas. She has been in this business for more than 9 years, which explains her good command of this activity. She gets her supplies from producers in the community of Sido and in surrounding villages. Sido is a rural community located 25 kilometers from Bougouni. She learned this business at a young age from her cousin.\r\n\r\nAfter a few solidarity loans with an association in her district, she decided to get her first individual loan. This is her fourth individual loan, after having successfully repaid all previous loans.

By starting her own small business, \u2018A Coach for Success,\u2019 Kumari has found a way to turn that passion into a career. \r\n\r\nKumari has been coaching individuals for over 30 years. Her unique coaching style, now embodied in A Coach for Success, draws on Kumari\u2019s education in Holistic Heath Education, experiences working with social service agencies, and lessons from her own process of self-discovery. A Coach for Success has been Kumari\u2019s side project while working a full-time job with a nonprofit organization in Richmond, CA, but she is now ready to take the plunge and invest herself fulltime in her business. \r\n\r\nKumari currently coaches 20 clients, teaches workshops in the community, and speaks at events. Being her own boss \u2013 with full control of her own schedule \u2013 will allow her to be a more effective coach, as well as reach out to more individuals. She has found over the past few years that her workshop and coaching style are particularly timely. Perhaps due to the economic recession, Kumari explains that, \u201cPeople feel like they need to look at their life right now. I ask them: What do you want? Why? What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d \r\n\r\nEven so, Kumari explains that marketing is the most challenging part of owning her own business; \u201cTransformation isn\u2019t often something that people want to go through.\u201d To help promote her business she needs products \u2013 such as stories, greeting cards, tapes, and more workbooks- to accompany her workshops and speaking engagements. With a $2,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, Kumari will be able to develop these products, increase other advertising efforts, and at last take her business to the next level. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about A Coach for Success, visit: http:\/\/acoachforsuccess.com   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":668861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To develop products such as cards, tapes, and workbooks to accompany her workshops; other advertising costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Oakland, California","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T20:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":149.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":162.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168.26},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":171.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":172.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":173.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.41},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.61},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":149.45,"local_amount":149.45,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":149.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474295},{"amount":162.41,"local_amount":162.41,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900108},{"amount":164.64,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":164.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339477},{"amount":164.64,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":164.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209507},{"amount":166.07,"local_amount":166.07,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":166.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284820},{"amount":166.9,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":166.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381932},{"amount":1025.89,"local_amount":1025.89,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854377}],"funded_date":"2010-12-22T11:21:20Z","paid_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":263418,"name":"Louise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Louise is 26 years old, married and has two children who are one and five years old.

She makes her living with a business selling cleaning products.  The business was initially her father's, but when he passed away, Rosa had to take it take over.  Because Rosa just gave birth to her daughter Adriana, her sister, Yolanda, is currently in charge of selling their products.  Rosa is only taking the necessary leave before she takes up the business again.  Even so, she hasn't stopped investing in the purchase of more merchandise.  She likes what she does, especially since she helped her father with the sales even as young girl.  She considers the work to be very profitable.  In addition, some of the cleaning products, like soap, detergents, brooms and brushes, don't have expiration dates, so she doesn't need to worry about selling them quickly.

She used the previous loans to pay school fees and buy few kilos of baking flour for her business and for household expenses.  She has paid back all her loans successfully.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She lives in a proper house and desire very much so to have a better quality of life.   Her business is metals and she has a shop where they mold and convert metals into useful structures, like sangucheros (trolleys, carts and tricycles, etc.)  In actuality, she has 3 workers laboring in the shop and they are the main assistants in the shop.\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing she likes about her job is selling the products because since it\u2019s her business she feels responsible to sell.

Her husband is laborer while she is a woman who runs different kinds of small businesses. Before she had an access to credit through ASHI, sufficient income to cover all her family expenses and business sustainability were the problems she encountered. These were also the reasons why she had been doing different kind of businesses. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Charmarose decided to join ASHI to address the problems she had. Firstly, she wanted to finance the business she thought best capable of generating a bigger profit. Then, the next problem, which is covering her family expense, would be solved once her business became stable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Charmarose\u2019s first and second loans were used to support her rice buy-and-sell business. She has been able to grow the business and has increased their family income. She was able to payback the loans on time and has been attending center meetings of ASHI on time, too. Every week she manages to save through ASHI for her other personal and family needs.\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, Charmarose is planning to use her loan to purchase a motorcycle as an additional business. Motorcycle-for-hire is one of the most common businesses of people in the municipality of Hamtic where she and her family live. This is the most convenient kind of transportation and people would rather choose it than a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar), since a motorcycle doesn't take long in the parking area waiting for passengers and can easily reach farther and more uphill places which is the typical landscape of the municipality. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Charmarose hopes that her businesses will grow more and that she will be able to purchase another motorcycle to have a bigger income. With this income, she wants to send all her children to college so that she will have the capacity to offer them a more worthwhile kind of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":364840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\nThe successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Only 2 of her children currently live with her in the house she owns, and they help her with her agricultural work.  Calm and serene like the chamomile in her plots, Florinda poses in one of her fields.  \r\n\r\nThe past few years have been very profitable, since every time she goes to the city she always takes her mat\u00e9 herbs and with the earnings she covers the cost of the trip.  In additional to chamomile, she also grows potatoes, olluco (another root vegetable), and peas.  She has done agricultural work her whole life, and she is very happy with this work, which has allowed her to educate her children and proviD. them with a very comfortable life. Once her crops are harvested, she prefers to sell them in markets in Lima, because they are more profitable than the markets in Tarma.  She is now planning to start an Internet service for her youngest daughter who is studying in the city, in order to help pay the costs of her education.   \r\n\r\nFlorinda is the founder of her communal bank.  She is the president, and through various consecutive loans she has shown herself to be very responsible in each of her payments.  The money she is requesting is for the purchase of chemical fertilizers for her potato and olluco crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":315712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-10T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3069.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733840}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T04:07:32Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":110997,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"I work as a tenant.

Tinei has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Tinei is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tinei plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":210262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To
