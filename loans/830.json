Bessarion and Liana work hard on their plot and sell harvested products at the local market. In spite of their hard work, the family lives below the poverty line and receives social assistance from the government. The total average monthly income of the family, including social assistance, is 650 Laris. \r\n\r\nBessarion requested credit for financing their seasonal agricultural work.

All of them strive to give their children a better life for the future of the country.\r\n\r\nAll are from the city of Pinotepa where \"las chilenas\" dancing is popular and where most of the inhabitants are indigenous and need the foundation's help to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Mrs. Cecilia, 42, who is a hard-working, humble woman who wants to expand her business.  Do\u00f1a Ceci, as she is known by her colleagues in the group, has been selling vegetables for three years.  She also teaches at the community school and claims that from a very young age she was always interested in teaching and helping children with slow learning skills.\r\n\r\nShe tells us about one of her business experiences.  When she started teaching she decided to sell vegetables as a way to increase her income, but did not know how to get started.  Later she learned about the foundation's loan program and started her business thanks to help from the foundation.  Her business is growing daily and she is earning enough to help her niece, Maria del Rosario, who she loves very much and works for, teaching and selling vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to buy more vegetables such as: potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, squash, carrots, green tomatoes, coriander, lettuce and papaya.  She is grateful to the foundation for supporting working women who want to improve their family's lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nBernarda Alejandrina - who sells Mexican snacks.\r\nPrimitiva Balbina - who sells cheese.\r\nAustreberta  Virginia - who sells dough and nixtamal.\r\nYolanda - who sells fried meats.\r\nAlba  Leonila - who sells clothing.\r\nGloria Rosalba - who sells softdrinks.\r\nGloria Josefa - who sells groceries.\r\nIsabel Josefa - who sells popsicles.\r\nYolanda - who sells food.\r\nClaudia Eva - who sells chili peppers and seeds.\r\n\r\nThey are grateful to the foundation for giving people the resources to get ahead and go into business so they can give their families, especially the children, a better lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6975,"image":{"id":1021503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy vegetables to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":6975,"lender_count":222,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernarda Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Primitiva Balbina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Austreberta Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba Leonila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Rosalba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":89000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3055.24,"local_amount":38984.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":39112.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656754},{"amount":1745.64,"local_amount":22274.08,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":22347.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317426},{"amount":2174.12,"local_amount":27741.52,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":27832.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418810}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T23:21:07Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":408349,"name":"Marta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marta has owned a small grocery store for about five years, where she sells basic needs such as vegetables, canned foods, sugar, rice, pasta, oil, beef, and chicken.

She has five children, three daughters and two sons, who are already married and have children of their own.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia lives with her mom.  Her business is selling bread and soft drinks.  She has been in this business for 20 years.  She tells us that she used to sell only bread and she only sold it retail.  However, over time and with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she bought more bread so that she could sell both wholesale and retail.  She tells us that she goes out into the streets of her community to sell her bread in the mornings and afternoons while her mom and grandchildren stay at home selling bread.  She tells us that she is very happy because, with the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she will be able to buy more bread to sell.  She will also buy soft drinks in different flavors so that her neighbors buy drinks from her at meal time.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for supporting her and making her dreams come true.

It is located in 'La Mesa' community, in the town of San Jos\u00e9 del Rinc\u00f3n, very near The State of Michoac\u00e1n.  The group voted on this name because they say that every year Monarch butterflies come to Michoac\u00e1n and to their community.  They are really happy about this and they receive the butterflies with a lot of happiness because they know that they are a part of their environment and they like them a lot.  This is why they gave their group the name they did.  Their community has beautiful views because it is high up in the mountains and they have a very good view of large swathes of green trees which are very beautiful.  The group has 11 members who are all female entrepreneurs.  They are friendly, optimistic, happy and, above all, responsible.

This community is known for being in a rural area which receives a lot of visitors to its beaches.  The main business activities in this area are tourism and agriculture.\r\n\r\nPedro says that he has thought about how beneficial it would be for his community to have a vegetable supplier because his neighbors do not have any businesses nearby that supply them with these essential products.  He also says that this business will help him to make progress in life and improve his personal financial situation as he believes it to be a promising project.  He adds that he has the support of his community in carrying out this business activity.\r\n\r\nPedro is currently requesting a micro loan for 1,050,000 colones so that he can buy vegetables to sell in neighboring communities.\r\n\r\nPedro is a member of the Ca\u00f1a Blancal community loan company, one of 110 organizations associated with EDESA in Costa Rica.

He is 55 years old and has been married to Marcelina, who is a homemaker, for 38 years.  The couple live in the town of San Felipe del Progreso.  This is a town that has all the public services its people need.  The couple have four children, only one of whom is still dependent on them.  He is in his fifth year of elementary school.  Jes\u00fas has an electromechanical workshop in the town center.  He is a very hard-working and entrepreneurial person.  Although he was not able to attend school owing to the fact that there weren't many opportunities to do so when he was young, he is a person with big ideas and a great desire to do well in life.  On this occasion, he is requesting a loan to buy a field where he can grow corn, barley and beans.  He has two years experience in this business of growing crops and he tells us that he has taken the decision to buy this field because he used to work in a way which is commonly referred to as doing work by 'going halves'.  This is when one person sets up the field and another person sows the seeds and works the land.  When harvest time comes round, half of the harvested crops go to the owner of the field and the other half goes to the person who worked the land.  Although this worked well for him, he realized that he could do better if he bought his own field because this would mean that all the harvested crops would be his.  Jes\u00fas will sow crops in his field.  Some of the harvested crops will be for his own consumption and he will turn some into fertilizer.  He says that once he has harvested his crops, he will sell them in the in market San Felipe.  This whole process will take him somewhere between four and five months.  Up to now, Jes\u00fas has not experienced any difficulties in carrying out his work.  As he is a very hard-working and entrepreneurial man, he says that he would like to buy and sell lambs in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1031196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a plot of land for growing corn and stover","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2195.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2246.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2298.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2352.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2407.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2463.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2521},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2579.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2640.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2764.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2829.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":528,"local_amount":6740.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6759.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656759},{"amount":565.83,"local_amount":7223.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7243.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317431},{"amount":399.56,"local_amount":5100.82,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5115.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418815},{"amount":418.43,"local_amount":5341.64,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5356.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568408},{"amount":438.18,"local_amount":5593.81,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5609.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399769}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T06:46:32Z","paid_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":408221,"name":"Dolores De La Concepci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dolores de la Concepci\u00f3n, es madre soltera con 3 hijos todos menores de edad originaria de la ciudad de le\u00f3n;

She is 34, married, and has five children aged 16, 13, 11, 7, and 5 years. She also has two additional dependents who live with her because she assists them with their schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fanta established her business. She began her business because, after her father's death when she was a child, there was no one to support her. Her mother gave her in marriage to a contractor, who gave her money to start a business. Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nFanta would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Fanta has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy cigarettes, water, and biscuits for sale and to pay employees.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fanta plans to build a house and acquire a shop.

In search of a source of income for her family, she became involved in animal husbandry in 1995, starting this business with an initial amount of 10,000 som (KGS).

They do not have children who are still dependent upon them.\r\n\r\nAlicia raises pigs.  She takes charge of cleaning and feeding them so that she will be able to sell them when they are grown.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a loan to be able to buy 12 pigs.  She says that the rest of the loan will be used to buy feed.  She has been engaged in this business activity for six years.  She started this business because she is a responsible and very hard-working person.  She wanted to have another income for her family.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty that she faces is when the pigs get sick and die.  This is a big loss for the family.  One of Alicia\u2019s goals is for her pig business to keep growing because the income is of great benefit to her and to her family.  \r\n\r\nAlicia and the rest of the group are very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the loan that was granted.

Nichi un lugar donde los arboles predominan, el grupo est\u00e1 conformado por 9 mujeres todas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas que es el bordado, precisamente el grupo se llama Las Artesanas del Fresno Artesanas por la actividad a la que se dedican y fresno por el lugar donde viven.\nDo\u00f1a Rufina tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad esta casada desde hace 32 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Santiago quien trabaja de obrero y agricultor aun tienen un ni\u00f1o  Aron Santiago que depende de ellos el cual est\u00e1 estudiando la primaria.\nDo\u00f1a Rufina se dedica al bordado nos cuenta que ya hace 32 a\u00f1os que se dedica a bordar, colchas, gabanes, chales, esquemesnes, tapetes con figuras representativas de la comunidad, las cuales son estrellas de trencillas, bordados de casita, figuras de caballo, y otros animalitos con el cr\u00e9dito otorgado do\u00f1a Rufina comprara tela de lana, tela estambron, estambre de madeja para bordar, aujas, tijeras, etc.\nUna de las dificultades mas grandes que presenta do\u00f1a Rufina es que casi no se vende ya nuestra artesan\u00eda porque las personas no quieren pagar el precio a que se le da al cliente se le hace muy caro y muchas veces nuestro trabajo no es valorado como deber\u00eda ser. Do\u00f1a Rufina comenta que para la elaboraci\u00f3n de dichos art\u00edculos se tardan de 20 d\u00edas hasta un mes dependiendo del art\u00edculo que vayan hacer.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que FRAC y Kiva les realizan al grupo de las Artesanas del Fresno es de gran ayuda ya que muchas veces no tiene para comprar sus materiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus actividades.\nPor lo que ellas est\u00e1n muy agrdecidas por el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado por lo que resto del grupo invierte en: Angelina, Maria Juana, Lucina, Maria de los Angeles, Leonila, Maria Lucina invertiran en bordados de artesanias y Maria Iris en productos de Belleza. \n\n","en":"The \u201cLas Artesanas del Fresno\u201d (The Ash Tree Artisans) group is located in Fresno Nichi a place where trees predominate.  It\u2019s composed of nine women who are all embroidery craftswomen.  The group is called Las Artesanas del Fresno precisely because of the activity they carry out and \u2018fresno\u2019 because of the place they live in.\r\n\r\nRufina, 52, has been married to Santiago, who works as a laborer and farmer, for 32 years; they still have a little boy, Aron Santiago, who depends on them and is attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nRufina is an embroiderer and she mentions that she\u2019s been doing this for 32 years; she embroiders bedspreads, ponchos, shawls, \"quexquemetl\" [embroidered lace cape], mats with figures representative of the community such as braided stars, embroidered little houses, horses and other little animals.  With the granted loan, Rufina will buy wool fabric, embroidery fabric, Madeja-style yarn, needles, scissors, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Rufina\u2019s greatest difficulties is that their type of crafts hardly sell anymore because people don\u2019t want to pay the prices quoted to customers; they think they are too expensive and often their work is undervalued.  Rufina relates that it takes from 20 days to a month depending on the item to be made to complete said items.\r\n\r\nThe loan that FRAC and Kiva will provide for the Las Artesanas del Fresno group is of great help for them because often they are unable to buy the materials they need to make their items.  Because of this, they are very grateful for the loan granted that the entire group will invest:  Angelina, Maria Juana, Lucina, Maria de los Angeles, Leonila, Maria and Lucina will invest in their artisanal embroidery work and Maria Iris in beauty products.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1044468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juna Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4160.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044559},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656765},{"amount":650,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8321.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317437},{"amount":975,"local_amount":12375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12481.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418821}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T13:50:57Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":408653,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is 49 years old and married with three children, ages 20, 18 and 13.

She is requesting a loan to purchase flour, butter, sugar, yeast, corn, meat, and lard.  She started her business four years ago.  She signed on with a baker and saw how to prepare bread, and in this way she learned to bake bread and her mom taught her to make tamales.  She enjoys baking bread and selling it.  She sells her customers sweet bread, rolls, holiday bread with nuts and raisins, and tamales.  Her business is important to her, because she gets income for her son who is attending school.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n   \r\nAnita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1056415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998166},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606715},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2579.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095572},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":859.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359182},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4298.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303511}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T03:17:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":408685,"name":"Cornelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"47-year-old Cornelio is a married man from Bien Unido, Bohol.

The members of this group decided on this name because that\u2019s what the place they live in is called.  It\u2019s characterized by being a tranquil community.  It is a very small community and practically all the residents know each other.  This group is formed by seven very optimistic, hardworking women who decided to join together in a group because they saw an opportunity to develop an economic activity that would help them contribute to their families\u2019 support.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members and their respective activities are as follows:\r\n1.- Rosa Mar\u00eda G. (to buy four lambs and pasturage)\r\n2.- Mar\u00eda Esthela S. (to buy lambs to sell)\r\n3.- Marisela G. (to buy chickens to sell and chicken feed)\r\n4.- Emma C.

(to buy 3 lambs to sell)\r\n\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda, 47, only completed first grade.  She does house work.  She\u2019s the group representative and has been married to Claudio V\u00edctor for 30 years; he works as a bricklayer.  They have nine children three of which still are dependent on them and attend 7th, 9th and 11th grades.\r\n\r\nRosa is a FRAC client and is very responsible and optimistic.  She requests this loan because she buys and sells sheep and chickens and also for feed and medicine to raise them with. She comments that she buys the chicks at her town\u2019s veterinary so that they will be healthy and sometimes she also buys them in her community; she buys the sheep in her community.  \r\n\r\nShe raises them at home and clears them of parasites in order to sell them later on.  She comments that it usually takes her four months to sell her chickens and up to a year to sell a little lamb.  She has three years\u2019 experience in this type of business so she knows she\u2019ll do very well.  \u201cWhat I do is raise my little animals and when they are ready I sell them earning profits.

to buy more merchandise like earrings, chains, bracelets and hoop earrings.\r\n\r\nWith support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she was able to buy more things both in gold and silver to obtain more profits since her younger customers like children in secondary school want less expensive items; this is when she decided to sell silver.\r\n\r\nLeti tells us that she always works with love since with her profits and effort she's been able to provide an education for her daughter that she loves and wants to support since she\u2019s both mother and father to her greatest treasure, her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more jewelry merchandise like earrings, chains, necklaces, bracelets and hoop earrings.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for supporting single mothers who want their children to go to school.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nLourdes Patricia- sells groceries.\r\nAdriana- sells perfume.\r\nErika

lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6425,"image":{"id":1033893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

For the past two years, Prisca has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prisca has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase milk for resale, and will help Prisca to generate greater profits to pay for medical expenses and other family needs.  Prisca hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nPrisca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

que quede en forma para la elaboracion del pan, despues separo la masa en 120 gramos para cada pan, en otro lado se le da la forma del pan que es redonda pero tambien ahi selecciono los que van hacer, chicos, grandes y medianos cuando ya estan formados pasaran al horno de le\u00f1a, donde tengo que estar atento ya que ser muy cuidadosos a la hora de cosinar voltear y una y otra vez para que no se quemen\"\nDon Hipolito tiene ya mucho tiempo haciendo el pan de monte desde que tenia 8 a\u00f1os de edad aprendio de su abuelo cuando cumplio 15 a\u00f1os el inicio su propio negocio. \"El problema

of Guadalupe Cot\u00e9, a community noted for being on the top of a hill where large trees abound.  Hip\u00f3lito is 45 years old and married to Juana.  He still has four children who depend on them and their 13 year old daughter is still attending school.  Hip\u00f3lito and his family work baking bread to sell.  He\u2019s asked for the loan to buy flour, milk, yeast and firewood because although he lives in a place where trees abound he cannot cut the trees down and firewood must be brought from another state.\r\n\r\nHe described to us how he makes the bread:  \u201cFirst I knead the dough until it\u2019s shaped to make bread.  Then I separate the dough into 120 gram portions for each piece of bread.  In another spot the bread is shaped usually into rounds but I also choose which will be made: small, large and medium.  Once formed they pass into the wood-burning oven where I have to be watchful and very careful while they are baking turning them over and over again so that they don\u2019t burn.\u201d\r\n\r\nHip\u00f3lito has been baking mountain bread for a long time.  He learned from his grandfather when he was 8 years old and when he turned 15 he started his own business.  \u201cThe problem I face is that often resources are lacking since flour is very expensive.  On the other hand, we are not allowed to touch the wood and I have to bring it in from someplace else and it is super expensive that way.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to have a mixer to make the bread more easily because by producing more his profits will increase.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very grateful for the loan authorized by FRAC and KIVA because it\u2019s very difficult to get loans from  other financial institutions because the interest rates they charge are very high.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1054745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"\r\nto buy flour, sugar, milk, firewood and yeast.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hitolipo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":597.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":611.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":639.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":670.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":685.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":718.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":734.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":752.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":787.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":805.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":824.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":843.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":863.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":883.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":904.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":925.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15041.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656779}],"funded_date":"2012-04-17T01:32:48Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":408737,"name":"Godafreda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Godafreda earns a living by running a sari-sari (variety) store business in Trinidad, Bohol.

They operate businesses making and selling \"ocochal\" (a traditional craft).  The members live in the town of El Oro, a beautiful place with houses that seem to belong to another time.  \r\nMagalli, 22, is single.  She just finished a degree in psychology and lives with her parents.  She is applying for a loan that she will use to buy supplies of brass.  She will make ocochal placemats and other tableware.  She will use the supply of brass to decorate her ocochal products, something that will allow her to fetch a better price for them.  \r\nMagalli says that her customers only want her products at certain times of the year, something that's a problem for her because she can't sell year-round.  She wants to go back to school to complete a higher degree in psychology because she only has a \"carta pasante\" now and she'd like to get an advanced degree that would allow her to work as a psychologist.  \"I am very grateful to FRAC and KIVA for helping me\", she says, \"because past loans have helped me to to make the products that I sell\".  She adds that her income from the business paid her school fees, books, etc.  \r\nThe other members are also grateful for your loans.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of accessory products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlora hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

inhabited by honorable people.  Just outside of San Juanito there is a large river with green trees.  The members of this group speak Mixteco and they tell us that they are proud of being from San Juanito and of their culture and language.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Irlanda, a 26 year old, hardworking woman.  She tells us that she considers herself to be a hardworking, humble woman who wants to improve herself.  She sells candy and food like: chicken turnovers, tostadas, fried tacos and sopes [a circle of fried masa with pinched sides. This is then topped with refried beans and crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce and sour cream. \r\n\r\nShe relates one of her work experiences:\r\n\r\nShe relates that she used to just sell candy at a school but with support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she bought ingredients to prepare dishes like: green chili, dried chilies, tomatoes, onions, cheese, cold cuts, string cheese and corn to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her business is that little by little and with work she\u2019s made it grow and with her same profits to prepare more dishes.

She is married to Neil, a policeman, and a mother to her three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.          \r\n                   \r\nArnelfa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArnelfa hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She dreams of them becoming successful people, and that's why she makes such a great effort working in her business, in which she makes articles of ladies', men's and children's clothing. She has her own workshop, operating in her home since 2007, located in the back part of the main room. It has a physical infrastructure adequate for her current level of production and sales. \r\n\r\nShe has 16 years of experience, going back to the time her mother taught her this trade. Her main clients are friends, family members, referrals, and drop-ins. \r\n\r\nYojaira sells for cash, through advance payments, and through installments up to two weeks. She also works half-time in a dressmaking workshop located near her home. Her suppliers are the fabric and accessories stores in the central area of Barranquilla, from which she buys her raw materials for cash. \r\n\r\nYojaira's business displays excellent liquidity ratios, but she wants to make a fixed investment; and her working capital is proving to be insufficient, and is a big challenge. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she is applying for her credikiva loan, the first loan she is taking out with Fundac\u00edon Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she hopes to invest in her inventory of raw materials and in an industrial serger. This way, she will increase the quantity and the quality of the clothing she makes.\r\n\r\nShe will be able to serve her customers in a timely way, as special dates are approaching, such as Secretary's Day and Mother's Day.

She is married to Domingo, a driver, and a mother to her three children.  Together with her husband she manages the household while operating her business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses.                      \r\n       \r\nLuzinda operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to members of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzinda hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1056518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":733,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":787.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998169},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":2934,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3152.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606718},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":3666,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3939.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095575},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":2934,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3152.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359185},{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":733,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":787.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303010}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T00:54:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":408749,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caroline is a 44-year-old married woman.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses.                       \r\n      \r\nRobelyn operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to members of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRobelyn hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1056530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-29T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-28T23:40:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":572.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998170},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2866,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606719},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2292.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095576},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359186},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1146.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303011}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T05:14:59Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":408784,"name":"Paul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paul is a 33-year-old married man.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonida hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her business is based out of her apartment.  She purchases materials for her business such as rubber, fique fiber, micro suit fabric, insoles, and packing material.  She designs the shoes and then takes the materials to a cobbler who makes the shoes for her.  Once the shoes are finished Beatriz packs them up and delivers them to her customers.  She also makes handbags, though that is a smaller part of her business.  She sells her items for cash and for credit.  Beatriz gets new customers through the Internet, on Facebook, in street markets, and by handing out fliers and business cards.  She also sells to two stores in Santa Marta.  The competition is low, and she meets the competition with the quality of her products, her success in fulfilling orders, and the overall satisfaction of her customers.  Her shoes are very beautiful and original with ecological patterns.  Her business has directly created two jobs\u2014hers and the cobbler\u2019s\u2014and contributes to the business of the two vendors who sell her products in the city of Santa Marta.         \r\n\r\nBeatriz has an excellent financial record.  Her business is small, since she sells most of her products for cash.  Her infrastructure is adequate for this type of business, and her financial record reflects an economic situation that is both stable and solvent.  However, as Beatriz\u2019s clientele expands, her biggest challenge is having enough working capital to purchase materials for her business.  That is why she has decided to take out a loan.  This is Beatriz\u2019s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it for working capital.  She will use it to maintain a cash fund for purchasing the materials she needs to produce shoes and handbags, which she will sell wholesale and retail.  Beatriz also wants to register her brand with the relevant government agencies, since that has been one of her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1053459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials for making shoes and handbags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":108527},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":126926},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129887},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":132918},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136019},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":139193},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":142441},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":145765},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":149166},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":152646},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156208},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180304}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.24,"local_amount":108527,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":109237.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141168},{"amount":72.8,"local_amount":126926,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":127756.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101048},{"amount":74.49,"local_amount":129887,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":130737,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338669},{"amount":76.24,"local_amount":132918,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":133787.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395233},{"amount":78.01,"local_amount":136019,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":136909.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775039},{"amount":161.52,"local_amount":281634,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":283477.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993890},{"amount":83.6,"local_amount":145765,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146718.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130253},{"amount":173.1,"local_amount":301812,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":303787.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519143},{"amount":193,"local_amount":336512,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":338714.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527079}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T14:48:24Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":408772,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema, a married mother of five children, four of whom are in school, lives in Kampala, Uganda where she resides in a home that she owns; she has access to electricity and piped water. <p>\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years Rehema has had a business selling bananas.

Mary generates an income from a business in which she sells assorted merchandise, which she promotes through specialized catalogs and she buys the products with cash and on credit.  What she makes on the sales does not allow her to pay with money that she has on hand.  This is because she makes the sales to her customers on credit with adjustable terms depending on what they can pay.  Her goal is to finish fixing up her house and that is why she works tirelessly in her own business.  She also does household chores to help other family members.  She started the business to support her household; previously only her partner covered the expenses.  \r\nMary is applying to CrediKiva, the first loan that she requests from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and she will use it to buy beauty products, lingerie, perfume, and merchandise on request.  Her biggest challenge is to have enough working capital to fill the orders and to be able to buy with cash.

called Abasolo San Juan Jicayan; it is made up of fourteen indigenous people from a town called San Juanito where the majority of the women dress in petticoats and their breasts are uncovered.\r\n<p>Most of the people make embroideries, sell chickens and have corn crops.\r\n<p>One of the members of the group is Mrs. Edna; she is a hardworking and indigenous forty-seven year old woman.\r\n<p>She has harvested corn for over twenty years and has sold chickens for three.\r\n<p>She says that what she enjoys most about selling chickens is caring for them since she likes waking up early to happily feed them corn and sometimes gets the nixtamal (corn flour mix) to make tortillas and gives them a little in a tray with water for them to eat.\r\n<p>Mrs. Edna is happily married to Mr. Julio who is forty-seven years old; they have four children named Lizbeth, Edna Melisa, Sandra Liliana and Jonatan.\r\n<p>Her children say they are very proud of their mother since she is a hardworking woman as well as humble and proud of her roots.\r\n<p>Mrs. Edna needs the loan to buy more feed to care for her chickens and corn for her crop.\r\n<p>She is thankful to the foundation for

The members of this group decided to take this name as there are trees near where they live that go by the name of ocotal, from which they obtain firewood.  This group is made up of five men and two women, who are very friendly and helpful.  They are very sociable, like to joke around, and are very accessible to each other, but above all they are very responsible.  One of the main activities that takes place in this community is growing vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members and their respective activities are as follow: \r\n1.- Alfredo G. (will purchase blender cups for sale)\r\n2.- Abel E. (will purchase resin figures for sale) \r\n3.- Ernestina M. (will purchase four piglets and food in order to raise them for sale) \r\n4.- Valent\u00edn G. (will purchase sweets, pistachios, peanuts and chickpeas for sale) \r\n5.- Felipe G. (will purchase 50 chickens, feed and milled corn in order to raise them and sell them)\r\n6.- Isabel R. (will purchase sodas, soup, eggs, and sugar for sale) \r\n7.- Lucio G. (will purchase two sheep and grass in order to raise them and sell them)\r\n \r\nDon Alfredo is a 39-year-old man, who is married to Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda del Carmen.  They have seven children together, of whom only three currently are still financially dependent on him. \r\n\r\nDon Alfredo is requesting this loan as he works selling plastics in particular selling cups to use with blenders.  He has six years of experience in this.  Every week or two when he needs merchandise, he goes to a community very near to his village which is called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec.  Here he stocks up on everything he needs.  He goes door-to-door selling his products, and on occasion, he sells in the market.  He decided to start up this business as he was working in Mexico City, and when his job terminated he found himself unemployed and needed to support his family.\r\n\r\n\"The only problem, as always, is the lack of money\", comments Don Alfredo.  He says that he also works growing vegetables, mainly cilantro, radishes, cauliflower and broccoli.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Alfredo is a very hard-working and responsible man who needs a financial boost.  A loan from Kiva will without doubt help him greatly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1052208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cups for using with blenders to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valent\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7040.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656790},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317461},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418845}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T10:04:04Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":408668,"name":"Bold-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bold-Erdene, who is 36, has a taxi business but his earnings don\u2019t usually cover his family's necessities.

Mercedes\u2019 goal is to have her own home but to do it she needs more income that is why her greatest obstacle is to have enough work capital that will match her expectations for growth and the needs of her grocery store. She needs a credikiva, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy cheese, groceries, dairy products as well as meat since it is widely sold. Her success is due to her meeting her customers\u2019 demands and this will increase her possibilities to sell in greater quantities and earn more profits little by little."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1054879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy cheese, groceries, dairy products as well as meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65395},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74699},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76442},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78225},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80050},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81918},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83830},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85786},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87787},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89836},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91932},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":65395,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":66104.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651562},{"amount":42.95,"local_amount":74699,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":75509.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101055},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":154667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":156345.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338674},{"amount":46.04,"local_amount":80050,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":80918.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775043},{"amount":47.1,"local_amount":81918,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82806.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387035},{"amount":312.38,"local_amount":543271,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":549165.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928795}],"funded_date":"2012-04-27T15:41:42Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":408789,"name":"Floripe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Floripe, 38, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines.

Nawal has worked as a tailor for 10 years. She started her business to help her husband make a living and raise their children. She stopped working for a few years when she found out that her children needed a lot of care and attention, but two years ago Nawal felt lonely since all of her children got married and she was left alone during the day busy with nothing to prepare for the kids who were supposed to be back home for lunch or dinner.\r\n\r\nSo working again was the best thing for her to improve her social life in addition to supporting her family again with additional income for whoever needs help. She is very happy that she took this path again, and she is willing to open a big factory in the future. Today, Nawal is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy a new and improved tailoring machine capable of doing a lot of work in a very short amount of time with especially good quality.\r\n\r\nKhadija is a 25-year-old married woman and mother of three gorgeous children who fill her whole life, and for whom she sacrifices hers in order to please them and provide them with the best living ever. Three years ago, Khadija started to work as a hairdresser. She faced a lot of problems and complaints from her husband at the beginning since he refused to let her work and start her own business. But at the same time, she had her husband's family's support, which helped a lot in taking the first step. Her business started at home, since her husband spends most of his time away and she had to fill her free time and at the same time stay next to her children. Most of her customers are friends, relatives and neighbors. Khadija is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary hair colors, a new hairdryer and necessary hair dressing tools to improve her business. She hopes that one day she will open her own beauty salon and all of her customers will support her there too since they are very loyal to her. She is sure that her husband, although he refused at the beginning, is very proud of her now.\r\n\r\nZalfa is a 43-year-old married woman and mother of three children. Zalfa has been working in the Mouneh business for 13 years. She inherited her business from her mother who used to do it in her village. That's what encouraged her to start this business in her husband's village. Zalfa makes jam, she prepares Mouneh during the summer months to be consumed during winter\u2019s harsh days. This way of preserving food helps foods to live a longer life. The Mouneh food has started in time to be a basic food for most of the Lebanese. Her business is improving and now is the suitable time to start working since everything is almost available to start preparing. That's why, to be ready for customers' replies, Zalfa is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy necessary goods such as vegetables, fruits and seeds , to start her preparations.
