The members of the group live in a village called Camotinchan which has many green trees and a wide, beautiful river winding through it called \"Los Tres\" (because it has three streams).\r\n\r\nMost of the men in the community grow corn, sesame, chili pepper, and tomato; and the women sell chicken, shoes and beef.  In the culture of Camotinchan, during carnival the boys and girls dance in the streets in their community.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mrs. Josellesica, a cheerful, hard-working woman who wants to help her family.  She is known as Jessica among the group members and people in her communty.  She sells Mexican snacks, gelatin, water, fresh fruit and sweets at the high school in her community.  She says she has been selling there for two years, and before that she sold her goods at the kindergarten for thirteen years. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Jessica, 32, is happily married to Ignacio, a humble, hard-working man who is a farmer.  They have three children, Jonatan, 16, Javier, 13 and Alexander, 2, who are their greatest inspiration.\r\n\r\nJessica tells us that what she likes most about her business is cooking for the youngsters and treating them well.  She says her workday is as follows: she takes her goods to the high school and when the students begin recess she sells them food and fruit.  Her son, Javier, and her nephew, Daniel, help by attending to everyone more quickly so they can play a little before returning to class.  What she enjoys most is feeling like she's the mother of all the youngsters.\r\n\r\nShe adds that the teachers support her as far as being able to sell at school, since there were two ladies vying for the business; but thanks to the teachers she was the one chosen.  She is very content, and even moreso with the support of the foundation, which has allowed her to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy more fruit and food ingredients such as dry chili pepper, green pepper, dough to make tortillas, and cheese. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nMaria \u2013 who sells clothing.\r\nConstancia - who sells chicken.\r\nAmelia -

","en":"Maria lives with her spouse and three children, ages 10 and 17, in the town of Soledad, twenty minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  There she has two businesses; she sells assorted merchandise and also sells food.  She came up with the idea of starting the business three years ago. She was looking for the opportunity to earn enough income to increasingly improve her welfare and that of her family, which had been her husband\u2019s responsibility up until that time. Customers who buy meals from her are located in the neighborhood where she lives, and she sells assorted merchandise door-to-door directly to customers in Soledad\u2019s town center.  She makes her purchases in cash. However, she makes her sales on credit and consequently, her greatest challenge is to have the enough working capital in order to meet the demands of her new customers. This is exactly the reason she has come to Kiva to request her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy assorted merchandise to fill customer orders, and the investment will be successful because goods will rotate quickly since they are bought with customers\u2019 needs in mind."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1054728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase assorted merchandise to fill customer orders.

He is married and has three children, aged 21, 19 and 17. In 1997, Mohamed established his palm oil and local foodstuff business.

Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 1,150,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

is 41 year-old Kadiatu.  She is married, and has 4 children aged 8, 6, 4 and 2 years. She has 5 additional dependents, who live with her to help in the business and to assist them in their learning.  In 1997, Kadiatu established her cooking condiment business. She began her business because she wants to be self reliant and to meet her personal needs. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,400,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Kadiatu has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional cooking oil, bags of rice seasoning, maggi, tomato paste and bags of onions. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 350,000. In the future, Kadiatu plans to increase her stock so she can have more customers, to increase her profit margin. With the loan she is assured to reach to a higher height. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1056618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

business.  Holik works as a hired driver for the municipal shuttle taxi.  He is a father of four children, and his wife works as a teacher at the village school.  Their family income is barely enough to over their monthly expenses, and this is why Holik is also involved in fattening up and selling livestock.  He primarily breeds sheep because he is very familiar with small livestock breeds.  Holik plans to use his next loan to buy five sheep and livestock feed for them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1060082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Holik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":787.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":812.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172.25,"local_amount":787.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":819.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452264},{"amount":177.75,"local_amount":812.56,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":845.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212508}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T09:08:42Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":409099,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 30 years old and lives in Buchanan, she is married with 3 children between the ages of 1 and 16 that live at home, for the past 8 years she has been selling fish, she is requesting a loan to purchase more fish (cassava fish,Bonnie fish) for her business.

All the members of the group are self-employed, and carry out activities such as raising and selling of animals. The members created a very close-knit group, able to jointly undertake activities that strengthen their partnership.\r\n\r\nCornelia belongs to the group, and she tells us that she raises and sells animals such as pigs, chickens, cows, and others. She says she has several customers who buy animals from her, which are later sold for slaughter. The work she does is very hard, and requires not only physical, but also mental effort.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for the loan in order to buy balanced feed for her animals, as she doesn't want them to lack food.

He is a professional electrician in Jamoat. Due to his small salary, he also runs his own business raising and selling livestock. Each week he goes to the Sunday livestock market and resells goats and sheep.

She works as a manager of a milk farm in the Petrovka village.  Having worked in the agricultural field for ten years, Zoya has knowledge and experience in breeding livestock.  Every year, the milk farm migrates to pastures in the mountains during the summer period, where Zoya moves too with the farm's employees.  Today, Zoya's business contains 3 heads of purebred dairy cows and 15 heads of sheep.  Sales of milk and milk products yield about 25,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zoya requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a purebred dairy cow.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a purchase of technology to improve her farm's functions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1061309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T22:50:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":428.57,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":20064.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095491},{"amount":1071.43,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754594}],"funded_date":"2012-04-17T00:52:12Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":410300,"name":"Lavenie De Ferrier 2, 4 & 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Belius est le coordinateur de son groupe Lavenie de Ferrier 2, 4 & 6.

Her youngest daughter-in-law lives near Urazgul' with her children.  Urazgul' helps her youngest son, who often comes to visit her.  This year, he wanted to buy a car, and Urazgul' decided to help him.  Urazgul' works as a security guard at a company that mines for useful materials.

called \"Comerciantes de San Juan\" and is made up of nine humble, indigenous people from a marginalized town named Santiaguito.  There are many green trees there, and the majority of people dress in \"huipiles\" [traditional embroidered dresses] and do not cover their breasts.  The majority of men in the community make a living by harvesting corn.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is se\u00f1ora \u00c1gueda, who is 31.  She has sold chickens and fish for 3 years.  What she likes most about her job is plucking the chickens and cleaning the fish.  She tells us that she goes out to sell them to the houses in the community in the mornings and afternoons.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is a widow and has 5 children:  Aurelio, Jose, Maria, Liliana, and Isabel, who are her biggest treasures.  They are her inspiration and strength for getting ahead.  One of her dreams is to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more chickens and fish to sell wholesale and retail.  She tells us that selling chickens is the most profitable because it's what her compatriots like a lot.\r\n\r\nShe tells us about one of her experiences:  what she first started to sell was chickens, she bought them little by little and went out to sell them to houses.  With her profits, she bought fish and stopped selling chickens.  But thanks to the support of the foundation, she bought more chickens and fish to sell.  Selling fish also makes good profits for her, but not more than the chickens.  She tells us that she is happy to have two businesses since these profits help her children with their education.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the foundation for helping good and indigenous people.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nCarmelita \u2013 who sells beef\r\nPablo - who sells beef\r\nJulia - who sells chicken\r\nMargarita - who sells embroidered clothing\r\nAlicia - who sells bread\r\nSonia - who sells bricks\r\nMarcelino - who sells Mexican comfort food\r\nEdith - who sells bricks.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to the foundation for helping good people who have the desire to improve themselves, get ahead, and fulfill their dreams.

Yemen. He started his business by buying a small Xerox machine then he opened a small bookshop. He has lots of time to dedicate to his business and many people prefer his business because he is honest and hard-working. He has many ideas for his business that he\u2019s been implementing little by little. He\u2019s been able to keep his business active for many years. \r\n\r\nMohammed is a very dignified, confident man and his customers give him good references.

She has been involved in this business for 3 years. Her business is located within a busy town and her primary customers are butcher men and farmers.

He also has a general store.  He is requesting a loan to buy supplies, weed killer, fertilizers, and urea to improve his crops.  He makes his purchases and sales in Montalvo on a weekly basis.  His goal is to increase his production and to keep working until his children are professionals and can support themselves.  The challenges he faces are the pests that invade his crops.
