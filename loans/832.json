He learned this work from his parents; he knows this job like the back of his hand. Furthermore, he makes an additional income from his rice crops.\r\nThe requested 2000 Nuevos Soles will be used for the purchase of urea to fertilize his recently transplanted rice crops, and for the purchase of a heifer which is on sale.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells ready-to-wear clothing for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Celma is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCelma hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through her hard work on her business.

The 32-year-old owns \"Klassy Kidzs Resale and Things\", a Sainte Genevieve resale shop with an inventory of newly-purchased, name-brand items. \u201cI don\u2019t sell junk,\u201d Jennifer says. Her store carries clothing for sizes between newborn and young men's pant size 36, along with a variety of educational toys, furniture and accessories, such as the $90 Jessica Simpson shoes she\u2019ll sell for $25. Some items are from her closet that her children never used or wore, or used and wore a couple of times; all without rips, stains and scratches. Nothing in Jennifer\u2019s shop is donated except for prom dresses she receives from the community. Jennifer is networking with a community school district to donate the dresses to deserving high school students. She plans to do this annually.\r\n\r\nWith a business plan in mind, Jennifer called St. Louis\u2019 directory assistance, which then connected her to Missouri\u2019s directory assistance and informed her of ACCION Texas, Inc.\u2019s newest location. Soon after, she applied online and was approved for the first ACCION loan of Missouri. Since then, she referred two friends to ACCION.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a boss,\u201d Jennifer says. Instead of making money for someone else with her knowledge and skill, she says, \u201cI\u2019d rather be the one making money.\u201d This pushed Jennifer to open her shop as she did on March 6. She is the only worker at the moment and she plans to keep it that way. This adheres to her plan of working for herself and making her own money.\r\n\r\nThe ACCION loan helped Jennifer pay for unexpected expenses, such as rent, the store\u2019s deposit, a cash register, checkout counter, sales racks and advertisement. Jennifer\u2019s children, ranging between 14 and five months, were her inspiration to open her shop. She says the ACCION loan \u201cactually helped me open something that\u2019ll help my community and achieve something I actually want to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1058493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Julliors is very happy because he will be able to work many more hours this way.  He is prepared to give everything of himself so that the small business he has will gradually increase his income.  This is how he plans to buy a vehicle that will offer much more safety and allow him to travel to areas much further away from the zone he works in currently.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1058229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay the downpayment on a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-31T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-30T19:30:11Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julliors Stewart","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":67.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":71.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":90.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":96.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.34,"local_amount":67.56,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602110},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":71.14,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091222},{"amount":27.24,"local_amount":72.63,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":72.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222284},{"amount":28.59,"local_amount":76.24,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":76.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298353},{"amount":29.28,"local_amount":78.08,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":78.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108745},{"amount":62.07,"local_amount":165.51,"processed_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":165.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315344917},{"amount":32.62,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":87.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088577},{"amount":69.05,"local_amount":184.14,"processed_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":184.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478183},{"amount":74.14,"local_amount":197.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":197.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775413}],"funded_date":"2012-04-25T22:04:03Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T11:21:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":409725,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, pero parece una joven de 20 ya que es muy alegre y entusiasta, es madre de 2 peque\u00f1os de 9 y 13 a\u00f1os, a los cuales ama much\u00edsimo a pesar de que de vez en cuando le sacan canas verdes ya que son muy traviesos;

To help expand his business, Musale has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

Her husband, Norberto, is a driver.  She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, The driver remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP25, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams to have another vehicle in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Es por esto que decidi\u00f3 montar su propio taller de elaboraci\u00f3n de productos en poliestireno expandido donde ofrece una gran variedad de productos, pero su producto m\u00e1s vendido son las pi\u00f1atas de cumplea\u00f1os. Paola gracias a este trabajo, ha podido salir adelante como madre soltera cabeza de familia, pues tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os a quien su padre nunca ha aportado ninguna ayuda. Debido a que su taller lo mont\u00f3 con muy bajo capital, Paola no cuenta con todas las herramientas de trabajo necesarias, es por esto que busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de un compresor con aer\u00f3grafo para pintar sus productos con mayor calidad.\nPaola de esta manera podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus clientes una mejor calidad en sus productos, por lo que aumentar\u00e1 sus ventas considerablemente. Adem\u00e1s, Paola espera que con su taller mejor dotado de las herramientas necesarias, pueda ser m\u00e1s atractivo para nuevos clientes y pueda as\u00ed sacarlo adelante.

About two years ago, she was working in a shop making pi\u00f1atas, advertisements on expanded polystyrene, and other products.  Since her boss left the city, he left her the clientele that he attended to she could keep serving them.  This is why she decided to start her own shop making products on expanded polystyrene, and she offers a big variety of products.  Her most-sold product is birthday pi\u00f1atas.  Thanks to this job, Paola has been able to get ahead as a single mother and head of the family.  She has a 3-year-old son whose father has never supported him with any help.  Since she started her business with very little capital, Paola doesn't have all of the necessary tools to do her job.  This is why she is looking for a loan that will offer her the possibility of buying a compressor with an airbrush so she can paint her products with better quality.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Paola will be able to offer her customers a better quality in her products, which will increase her sales considerably.  Additionally, Paola hopes to equip her store with the necessary tools so it can be more attractive for new customers so she can progress with her business.  Paola dreams about having a big shop so her son can have a better quality of life and access to a quality education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1011827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a compressor with an airbrush to paint her products with better quality.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-31T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-30T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35622},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36621},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37649},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38705},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39791},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40907},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42055},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43235},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44448},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45695},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46977},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48295}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.29,"local_amount":72158,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":76631.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902513},{"amount":22.39,"local_amount":37309,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":39622.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326865},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":38179,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":40546.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432251},{"amount":48.99,"local_amount":81649,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86711.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432915},{"amount":1.73,"local_amount":2877,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617392},{"amount":23.09,"local_amount":38489,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40875.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640321},{"amount":53.02,"local_amount":88372,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":93851.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029394},{"amount":55.6,"local_amount":92672,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":98417.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548064},{"amount":28.98,"local_amount":48295,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":51289.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356518223}],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T16:34:07Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:24:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":409961,"name":"Lenilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lenilia is 54 years old.

They chose their name because of the place where they live.  The community is peaceful and has all services like schools, a health center, electricity, drainage, potable water, etc.  All of the people in the area have access to these services.\r\n\r\nFederico is the representative of the group.  He is 38 and has been married to his wife, Alejandra, for 17 years.  Together they have 4 children, 3 of whom are in school.  Alexa is 3, Jonathan is 8 and in elementary school, and Ivan is 15 and in high school.\r\n\r\nFederico has made a living raising sheep for more 15 years.  He tells us that he started this business because he learned it from his father.  He has requested a loan to buy 5 lambs, and he will use the rest to buy fodder, corn, and feed.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that one of his biggest difficulties is when he doesn't have the necessary resources to buy feed. Federico believes that this is one of the reasons his sheep get sick, and when this happens, Federico has to buy anti-parasitics and vitamins to apply to the sheep. \r\n\r\nHe says, \"The loan is going to benefit me a lot because I will be able to buy corn.  I need this because this year the corn harvest wasn't very good.\"\r\n\r\nThis time, Federico's goal is to keep growing his business to have more sheep that are good quality so his profits will get better and he can improve his family's quality of life.  Federico and the rest of the group are very thankful for the loan that is being offered to them so they can invest it in their respective activivities.  Maria Elidia, Josefina, and Carolina will invest in their sheep while Jose will invest in chickens."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6650,"image":{"id":1056961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ejido de Mayorazgo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-31T21:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-30T21:00:04Z","loan_amount":6650,"lender_count":194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Elidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15439.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16168.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16745.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17485.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18160.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1222.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1280.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1384.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1222.28,"local_amount":15439.3,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":15470.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656793},{"amount":1280.03,"local_amount":16168.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16201.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317465},{"amount":1325.71,"local_amount":16745.77,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":16779.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418849},{"amount":1384.27,"local_amount":17485.46,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17520.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568431},{"amount":1437.71,"local_amount":18160.6,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-17T08:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":18197.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399778}],"funded_date":"2012-04-18T01:17:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-17T08:08:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":409965,"name":"Wafaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wafaa is a 35-year-old married woman and mother of two children.

When she stopped being an employee she worked helping in the family small business, and succeeded in building up their sales, which they do by the dozen, to small merchants and to employees of other companies. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she, her husband, and one employee work in the business, and they don't have an industrial sewing machine. That's why they have to outsource the service, and pay a bit more for this job.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to succeed in expanding their business, improve their production process, and increase the volume of their purchases in order to get discounts. \r\n\r\nThis is why why she is applying for her credikiva loan, her first from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy an industrial sewing machine, and invest the balance in insoles, leather and glue, in order to make new designs and market them. This way she will meet her requirement for modernity,  justifying in this way the investment.

Esta actividad la inici\u00f3 porque siendo profesora de manualidades,  sus estudiantes ten\u00edan la necesidad de comprar las materias primas para trabajar en sus clases, as\u00ed fue que se ide\u00f3 la forma de vend\u00e9rselas ella misma y tambi\u00e9n de comercializar los productos que sabia hacer.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo ante la creciente clientela, es que su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente para las expectativas que ella tiene y este es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos artesanles \u00fatiles escolares, chancletas, desechables, cosm\u00e9ticos y mercanc\u00eda variada, para responder a su clientela y esto es lo que hace que su inversi\u00f3n sea exitosa.  ","en":"Katherine is a 25-year-old married woman with a 4-year-old son. She has undertaken an activity to produce income, which is making and decorating  products by hand from a foamy material. She also sells novelty items and craft supplies. She started this business because, as the craft instructor, she realized her students needed to buy primary materials.It occurred to her that she could sell the supplies and also the products she learned to make. \r\n\r\nWith her savings, she started the business and slowly added sales of handicraft supplies. She eventually added miscellaneous items when she bought her first showcase in an opportunity offered by a friend. Her father helped her. With his visionary spirit, he offered her his well-located house so that she could give handicraft classes. She also uses it as a commercial space, where she sells supplies and all the things the local population needs. \r\n\r\nKatherine bought the infrastructure little by little on credit. In this way, she was able to buy more display cases and stock them. In addition to her business, she offers photocopying and sells cellular minutes. Her goal is to continue growing her business and building a future full of successes for her son. Her major challenge, given her growing clientele, is that her working capital turnover is insufficient to meet her expectations.This is why she came to Kiva credit.

There he has a business selling groceries, snacks, soft drinks, and household products, to families who live mainly around his store. \r\n\r\nDiomedes started his business more than two years ago in a rented locale, because his entrepreneurial spirit directed him toward an independent livelihood, where he could stop being an employee, and be his own boss--which he has now succeeded in doing, as gradually he has bought work equipment and fixed assets that now belong to him. \r\n\r\nHe sells every day in his business, which he and his partner run. Both have as their future goal, to buy the shop they rent. Their greatest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to fulfill their objectives quickly. These are to invest in store items with the highest turnover, buying in greater quantity, and enabling them to decrease the frequency of their purchases and earn volume cash purchase discounts. In this way they can generate higher profits.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the reason why he is applying for his credikiva loan, his first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan, he will buy groceries, snacks, soft drinks, and other drinks; products that sell very quickly and through which he will achieve the above-mentioned goal.

She is a young \"Porte\u00f1a\" (someone born in Puerto Colombia), who has always lived surrounded by the beach, breeze, sea, and love of her family.  With her husband, they started a business through which they sell items for families, like supplies, food, soft drinks, and beverages, in a community that makes purchases every day for their families.  Her main customers are housewives, who pay mainly with cash.  Before she had this business, Rosa tried to get a job unsuccessfully.  This is why she started the store with her husband.  At first, they had very little investment and a small selection, but as time passed, and with their work ethic and good customer service, they were able to capitalize on their profits and acquire fixed assets.  The area where the store is located is very popular and is characterized by having a lot of kids playing soccer in its dusty streets under the incessant and customary Caribbean sun.  The loud sound of salsa music is also heard, which the townspeople like to share.  This is part of the cultural landscape where Rosa lives.  She doesn't have competition with her business because she is always worried about being friendly and accomodating each customer, keeping their budget in mind.  Currently, Rosa is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy supplies to increase her selection and her sales and to generate greater income to continue benefiting her

She learned this business when she was very young in her native Ovejas, a town in the department of Sucre, from which she emigrated to the north of the country, looking for opportunities for well-being. When she began, everything was not easy, since she prepared her products and, under downpours generating great streams, she went out with her husband to sell them early in the morning, in the afternoon, and even in the night. With all this work, she has succeeded in getting ahead with her family and in everything, thanks to the support of her husband, who has been working closely with Martha.\r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to achieve better income to raise their children to have successful careers. At this time, her growing clientele has made her working capital insufficient to expand and produce in larger quantity, and this is exactly the reason why she has turned to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy basic materials and ingredients, such as flour, meats, and vegetables, and an industrial stove with two burners, which which she can increase her production and make her work more effective.

She has a small dressmaking shop in her own neighborhood, through which she generates income to support her household.

Her main clients are local notions stores, and stores in the center of the city of Baranquilla and in shopping malls, with which she maintains business relationships. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to someday expand her business, primarily by organizing her workshop better. She also wants to have a large clientele, and employees, in order to meet her commitments in a timely way. Her greatest challenge in fulfilling her dreams, is that faced with the growing market demand, her working capital is becoming insufficient. \r\n\r\nThis is why she is applying for her credikiva loan, her first from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she will buy raw materials and supplies in order to respond to her customers. She will also buy an industrial sewing machine, with which she will improve her process, be more productive, and improve the quality of the garment.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment lies in the fact that it is justified in terms of customer orders, which are from the stores that Marbel supplies, and whose customer loyalty she plans to continue fostering.

Her oldest son attends the university studying Civil Industrial Engineering.  His dream is to become a professional.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza because the loan will allow her to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThe training she\u2019s received has taught her to organize her business\u2019 bookkeeping better and she now keeps track of her earnings and expenditures.  With respect to the communal bank group she belongs to, it is very responsible and committed so Elizabeth feels very comfortable.\r\n\r\nCuric\u00f3 is located in the Maule Region in the center of the country.

She loves them very much and it is for their sake that she goes out every day motivated because she is both mother and father for them since her spouse abandoned them.  However, in spite of all that, she got ahead because her children are the most important thing to her.  Her home is in the city of Nazca, a city that is known for having one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country, the Nazca Lines.  These lines are drawn over an vast expanse of desert and, according to some studies, they would have served as a calendar for the Nazca culture in centuries past.  It is also known for its hot climate and, above all, for the friendliness of its inhabitants.  When she has free time she loves to listen to music and to take the opportunity to eat one of her favorite dishes, the delicious escabeche.  She wasn't able to finish her legal studies because her parents didn't have enough money.  This is why she is working hard, so that her children will be better than she is.\r\n\r\nWith much effort and saving, Gaby was able to buy cars and so she has a business renting cars for taxi services.  She works around 12 hours a day.  She thinks her business is going well because she puts a lot of effort into getting ahead since her children's well-being depends on it.  This is what motivates her to do things well every day.\r\n\r\nGaby is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is thanks to the help they have given her that she can perform maintenance on her cars and refurbish them.

She thinks things are going well for her business because God is always with her, in the good and the bad. And He has given her the best gift that a person could have, which is her daughter.

With these improvements she will be able to show her products in a better way and have her business better organized. Then her customers will see that her business is clean and they will feel more confident in buying her products.

She works around 12 hours a day.  She believes that it is going well for her because she attends to the customers in a friendly way and because she sells quality products.\r\n\r\nJulia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they have given her she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business, particularly rice, sugar, and canned tuna, among other things.

Now his worries focus on taking care of his crops of peas, potatoes and broad beans, where he invested most of his capital. Federico shares that he soon will be able to improve the quality of his vegetable crops, since he has a garden tent, where he planted many different varieties of them. Also another project of his is to better the breed of his sheep by purchasing a pure bred male to impregnate the females. \r\n\r\nFederico belongs to the solidarity group Flor de Papa [Potato Flower] and this is the first loan with MFP where he feels realized since he receives the support to improve his business.

Furthermore, she likes to work with her association because they are responsible and work together in solidarity.  \r\n\r\nUpon receiving the support, Monica will invest the money requested in purchasing supplies to make the bricks."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1018868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:21Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":152.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":155.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":163.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":152.37,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714046},{"amount":58.49,"local_amount":155.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":156.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202942},{"amount":61.26,"local_amount":163.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":164.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098613},{"amount":63.17,"local_amount":168.46,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":169.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401456},{"amount":66.42,"local_amount":177.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":177.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455750},{"amount":68.52,"local_amount":182.75,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":183.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452439}],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T13:26:17Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":400982,"name":"Nolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nolita is 43 years old and has three school-age children.

For the last year he has been working in commerce, specifically, he has been in the videogame renting business. He started his business when he was 23. At the time he only had a television and a PlayStation 2 console. Currently, he has two televisions and two PlayStations that were donated by his father who lives abroad. Freydis is one of the few salespeople with a business of this type in his community, since it is not easy to find a video game place where most children can entertain themselves. He expects to increase the number of PlayStations and televisions so that he can meet the demand that there is in his community. He would like a loan to buy another PlayStation and a 21 inch television that he think will help him meet the demand he is getting in his video gaming center and will increase his profit that will be used to keep expanding his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1037433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to buy a television and a PlayStation for his entertainment business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:27Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freydis Noel \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":345.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":38.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":38.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710255},{"amount":38.88,"local_amount":38.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403693},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":38.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428640},{"amount":38.88,"local_amount":38.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":38.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613349},{"amount":77.77,"local_amount":76.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":77.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452831},{"amount":77.77,"local_amount":76.7,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":77.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443756},{"amount":38.92,"local_amount":38.38,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":38.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005892}],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T18:24:19Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aram Morera-Mesa","image":663826}},{"id":403698,"name":"Khadim Rassoul Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 Khadim Rassoul existe depuis le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2010, il est compos\u00e9 de treize femmes qui sont parentes et amies; leurs activit\u00e9s principales sont le petit commerce et l'embouche ovine.\n\n\nMadame Penda la responsable est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 42 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e m\u00e8re de deux enfants et a la charge de six autres personnes.
