south-east of Ukraine. Tatyana sells women's clothing - dresses, skirts, blouses - at one of the main local markets. Her clients pre-pay for their orders since this results in a lower price, and have access to items from local producers. Tatyana has been in this line of work since the nineties. Currently, she has 45,000 hryvnia worth of goods and earns roughly 4,000 hryvnia per month.\r\n\r\nTatyana has turned to Kiva for a loan of 21,000 hryvnia in order to stock her shop with seasonal merchandise. The clothes she offers to her customers are always beautiful and stylish as they are unique and have no equivalents on the market. Moreover, Tatyana knows her merchandise very well and always works hard to achieve her customers' satisfaction. She would like to continue developing her business and to give her daughter a good start in

selling sheets and blankets.  She made a good profit as merchandise like this was in high demand during such a cold winter.  Thanks to the money she earned, she is able to educate her son who studies in an external degree program at one of the colleges.  Likewise, the family was able to buy new kitchen furniture.  \r\n \r\nThis time, Irina has applied for a loan as she wants to prepare her kiosk for Spring.  She will reequip her kiosk and buy the raw materials for weaving artificial flowers and wreaths for the Easter holidays.  Irina herself will do the weaving, and her son is also ready to help her with the business.  They are planning to return to their earlier merchandise and to resume selling sheets towards Summer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":901305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

family are from Khoost in western Ukraine.  He rents a warehouse that has been reequipped as a blacksmith shop.  There Alexander manufactures exclusive forged works:  handrails, gates, furniture, various pedestals and racks, etc.  Nothing he produces is made from a pattern.  He approaches each work individually and creates outright miracles.  Alexander has no competition to speak of.  His goods are in demand, and he has his own client base.  He has been working in this business for 9 years now.  \r\n\r\nAlexander is planning to invest the loan of 12,000 hryven, received through Kiva, in purchasing additional equipment for his blacksmith shop.  He wants to buy grinders, drills, etc.  Alexander is a true master craftsman.  Everything he makes is carefully done and unique.  The client always receives something tailor-made since Alexander does not clone his own works.

He is in the greenhouse farming business and he grows early tomatoes, cucumbers, and radishes.  Yuryi has a large piece of land, on which there are three 10x60m greenhouses, as well as two separate greenhouses for seedlings.  This year, Yuryi invested 80,000 hryven in the installation of heating in all the greenhouses, which has fundamentally increased his business' potential.  Yuryi has been farming for 10 years now and has 200,000 hryven invested in his farm.  He spends about 43,000 hryven every year buying seed and greenhouse film.\r\n\r\nYuryi would like to invest additional funds, received through Kiva, in purchasing greenhouse film for 4,000 hryven, radish seed for 2,000 hryven, as well as coal for 9,000 hryven.  Yuryi needs to prepare his greenhouses and the land for the growing season.  In the fall, he had purchased a load of coal, but because of the strong freezes this winter, its use was more than expected.  Because of this, he now needs to buy additional coal.  Yuryi wants very much to invest in the improvement of his home.  You see, it's a big house, but it needs repairs.  Very recently, Yuryi installed new windows and poured concrete floors.  For now, there is no money for repairs because the family has decided to invest all their funds in the greenhouses.  Otherwise there will be nothing to live on later."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1055227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

For already 10 years he has been growing vegetables in greenhouses.  On his piece of ground there are 2 large greenhouses of 10x100 meters and 8x80 meters, one 4x9m  greenhouse for seedlings, and a 8x10m forcing bed.  Victor has been in the farming business for 10 years in a row.  He has invested considerable funds in his farm--about 150,000 hryven.  Every year he spends about 64,000 hryven on repairs and improvements of the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nVictor is planning to invest the loan of 12,000 he receives through Kiva for the purchase of coal for heating the greenhouses.  He already put a potbelly stove in one greenhouse and he would like to put one in the other.  This system of heating requires coal.  Victor hopes that the 2012 growing season will be successful and that he will have a good harvest.  Victor is planning to expand his business and buy more land in order to build additional greenhouses and to buy a larger vehicle for his business and family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1055230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

From a very young age Samuel accompanied his father in the farming activities, and at one point he decided to set up his own business and begin to generate resources on his own.\r\n\r\nThis is how he began with the business raising and selling pigs, which has allowed him to have a better quality of life for his family.  With this business he has been able to improve his parents' quality of life as well as to enjoy greater economic opportunities.  This is why Samuel wants to make his business keep growing, to further support his parents.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Samuel is looking for a loan that will give him the opportunity to buy livestock to raise to diversify his animal sales and increase his sales.\r\n\r\nSamuel estimates that with a variety of animals to sell he will have better sales and, consequently, a better quality of life.  He also dreams about giving his parents much more stable finances, which will allow them to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1012130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock to raise to diversify his animal sales and increase his sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Cristobal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":71244},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":73243},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75298},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77410},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":79582},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":81815},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":84110},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":86470},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":88896},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":91390},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":93954},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96588}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":144933,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":147505.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902515},{"amount":42.59,"local_amount":74071,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":75385.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326867},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":76358,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":77713.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432253},{"amount":45.57,"local_amount":79258,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":80664.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378288},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":83972,"processed_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85462.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432917},{"amount":311.31,"local_amount":541408,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":551017.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617394}],"funded_date":"2012-04-04T04:57:42Z","paid_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":402117,"name":"Nihaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nihaya is a conservative woman, for that reason she has asked her younger brother Ahmad to appear in the photo instead. \r\n\r\nNihaya is a 29-year-old housewife.

What's more, Nancy is the only person in the area who provides this service. Since she is such a hardworking woman, she spends her free time selling a variety of clothing to the people in her area, who feel grateful toward her, since she allows them to buy some items on credit, with payment later. Now she would like to increase her earnings in order to open a clothing store, a stable place of business.

Es por ello que hace 15 a\u00f1os, compr\u00f3 10 hect\u00e1reas de terrenos agr\u00edcolas donde siembra caf\u00e9 y pl\u00e1tanos en grandes cantidades. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de la agricultura es estar en el campo, cultivando y cuidando los sembr\u00edos que pronto dar\u00e1n frutos. Seg\u00fan cuenta en \u00e9pocas de cosecha, se dedica al acopio de caf\u00e9, para eso compra y vende a una empresa de producci\u00f3n, obteniendo as\u00ed un dinero extra que suma tambi\u00e9n a la comercializaci\u00f3n de sus propios granos. Pero la actividad a la que dedica la mayor parte de su tiempo, es el negocio de cabinas de Internet, locutorio (donde se hacen llamadas telef\u00f3nicas) y cabinas de proyecci\u00f3n de pel\u00edculas.

As they are old, he is lovingly caring for them in his own house, located in the town of Yapaz Bajo, San Luis de Shuaro district - Chanchamayo. Elvis has one son, Airton, of 17 years of age. Although they don't live together, Elvis loves him and does everything possible to provide him with a high quality of life. \r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that, 15 years ago, Elvis bought 10 hectares of land, where he plants coffee and bananas in large quantities. What he likes most about agriculture is being in the fields, growing and taking care of the plants that will soon bear fruits. During the harvest season Elvis stocks up coffee, thus he buys and sells to a production company. This way he gains extra money, on top of trading his own beans. \r\n\r\nBut the activity on which he spends most of his time is his shop of internet booths, phone booths, and movie showing booths. He is doing very well, as there isn't any other such shop in the area; he is the only one in this trade. For that, he is thinking every day on how to improve customer support and the level of service.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his fifth loan received from MFP. Elvis counts on its collaboration to be able to realize his plans. He commits, one more time, to fulfill the payment for his installments, as he did with his previous loans. He is also pleased to be a member of his communal bank \"El Palomar al \u00c9xito\", as all its members are responsible people.  \r\n\r\nElvis, when obtaining this support, will invest the requested money into paying for his machines' maintenance. He will also buy some sacks of organic compost, to fertilize his coffee plantation.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1018024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for his machines' maintenance and to buy sacks of compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447810}],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T22:19:44Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Raluca Apostoiu","image":976620}},{"id":403318,"name":"Sokkhoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokkhoeun (in the photo), age 53, is a widow mother with one son and three daughters.

His responsibilities include looking after his two beloved children, as things worked out so that he has been a widower for a year. Now what he most wants is to be able to give his children a better quality of life. Lidio is a man who earns a profit. He carefully tends his coffee plantations, work that he has been doing for more than 30 years. During harvest time he has the help of daily laborers, and so he can rapidly harvest the beans and then sell them in the center where all the farmers take their coffee. Here he gets a good return on every kilo of coffee. The difficult thing for him is to transport his sacks of coffee beans to the collection center where the buyers congregate. In time, he wants to buy more cocoa and coffee plants to increase his plantings and he is prioritizing buying these as they will bring him good returns in his next harvests and he will use the profits to give his children a good life. This will be his fourth loan from MFP. He is very happy with the confidence they have shown in him and is ready to make his monthly repayments as this will enable him to access other loans. He is glad that the members of his community bank are able to work together. He will use the $1125 to buy land to grow more plants. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1018662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy agricultural land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":260.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":262.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":271.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":284.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":294.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":302.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":314.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":326.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":337.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":345.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.9,"local_amount":522.39,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":524.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714028},{"amount":101.97,"local_amount":271.93,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":273.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202924},{"amount":106.68,"local_amount":284.49,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":285.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098595},{"amount":110.46,"local_amount":294.54,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":295.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401438},{"amount":113.61,"local_amount":302.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":304.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455732},{"amount":117.77,"local_amount":314.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":315.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451427},{"amount":122.52,"local_amount":326.71,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":328.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446613},{"amount":126.53,"local_amount":337.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":338.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052633},{"amount":129.56,"local_amount":345.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":346.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187739}],"funded_date":"2012-04-05T21:50:19Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":399047,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00f3nica, de 27 a\u00f1os, vive en su propia casa junto a su c\u00f3nyuge Edgar de 35 a\u00f1os y sus 02 estimados hijos a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida.

What she likes most about her work is being able to see the precious fruits that grow over time, benefitting from the way she has cultivated them. On the other hand, she finds it difficult that insect pests affect her plants and they can be difficult to deal with.

She is a very hardworking woman who has a business selling vegetables in the market in her area.  She has been doing this work for 8 years, and for her this work is very easy.  She does not need a lot of help, and so she is able to do the work on her own, although she enjoys being with her daughters because they are her only happiness.  Elsa's work is very profitable, because she is always selling her produce and in this way she is able to pay for her household expenses as well as her daughter's school expenses.  She will invest this loan that she is requesting in her produce stand.  However, what she desires the most is to be given a snack bar in her daughter's school where she could sell candy as well as cold cuts, because then she could allocate her time between the two businesses and in this way manage to change her quality of life and provide her daughters with a good education.

She is Alejandro\u2019s wife, and he is 42 years old. They are the parents of two beautiful daughters, Tania who is 18 years old and Maydelin who is 8 years old. They live in their own home. Claudia is an optimistic woman and always thinking of her family. \r\n\r\nSome time ago she considered opening a ceviche stand in her neighborhood to offer a good service. She began fixing up her facility so that she could make a good appearance and attract the attention of people, and now, since then, she has the help of her husband and both are dedicated to giving her customers good service.\r\n\r\nShe is in her stand very early and people passing by always get to try the tasty rich ceviche with a drink. This is how Claudia attends to her customers and why people always return to Claudia\u2019s Ceviche Stand.\r\n\r\nAt first she began with few supplies for her business and now with the loan she is requesting she will be able to buy some supplies that she lacks in her ceviche stand. This will be her sixth loan through MFP. She is ready to make her payments punctually in order to request another loan. She is a trustworthy member of her communal bank and united with her partners. With the 2,500 soles, she will buy plates and serving dishes and everything necessary for her food stand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1018811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy plates and serving dishes for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":216.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":218.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":226.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":236.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":245.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":252.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":280.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":289.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":165.29,"local_amount":434.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":442.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714039},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":226.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":230.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202935},{"amount":90.02,"local_amount":236.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":241.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098606},{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":245.26,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":249.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401449},{"amount":95.87,"local_amount":252.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":256.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455743},{"amount":99.36,"local_amount":261.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":266.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451438},{"amount":103.38,"local_amount":272.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":276.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446624},{"amount":106.76,"local_amount":280.96,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":285.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052644},{"amount":110.07,"local_amount":289.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":294.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187750}],"funded_date":"2012-04-18T17:22:48Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":402157,"name":"Zainab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainab's husband has recently retired from the military, so they opened a small grocery store in their neighborhood where her husband and her brother work together.

For seven years she has worked selling clay objects such as pots, stoves, vases, glasses, piggy banks, etc.  She travels on the weekend to other neighboring cities to sell, and the first days of the week she stocks up on new merchandise.  On her trips, she always has the help of one of her daughters, who helps her sell.  On her days off she also makes sales, of natural medicines to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nOver time she has seen her income improve and maintained her capital, which grows little by little.  She considers that her business is profitable because it generates good income for her and she can support her business by adding the income from her husband, who works as a professor.  It is for this reason that she wants to increase her working capital, to improve her merchandise and so have more customers.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the La Florida solidarity group and this is her third loan with MFP, where she feels well developed because she gets help to make progress in her business.  For this reason she promises to be punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she likes to work in her bank because the people are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nIf she receives her support Esperanza will invest the money requested in buying more clay pots and clay animals, which will help to save money.  This will allow her to increase her capital in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1018865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clay pots and decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":168.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":178.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":196.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":201.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":211.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":222.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":231.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":241.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.49,"local_amount":334.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":336.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714045},{"amount":66.95,"local_amount":178.51,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":179.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202941},{"amount":68.24,"local_amount":181.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":182.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098612},{"amount":73.78,"local_amount":196.73,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":197.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401455},{"amount":75.7,"local_amount":201.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":202.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455749},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":211.29,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":212.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451440},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":222.18,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":223.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446626},{"amount":86.79,"local_amount":231.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":232.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052646},{"amount":90.5,"local_amount":241.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":242.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187752}],"funded_date":"2012-04-21T00:57:16Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":402158,"name":"Olfat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olfat is a conservative woman who asked her husband Hashem to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nOlfat is a 23-year-old married lady whose husband Hashem works as a driver.

She lives with her mother, Rosa, and her brother, Andr\u00e9s, whom she supports.  They live in their own house in San Pedro de Sa\u00f1o.\r\n\r\nHer father died four years ago, and ever since then she has had to face the family responsibilities.  \u201cI learned to be independent,\u201d she says.  She started to study graphic design in a well-known institute in the area.  That is where she also managed to become passionate about photography.  She took specialization classes in the capital with people who are well-known locally in the field. \r\n\r\nFrom there it has been two years since she has been working as an independent photographer.  She takes publicity photographs for national companies.  She earns very well for having recently started in this business.  She still does not have a specialized photography studio.  Her biggest wish is to have one of her own.  She has already taken the first step by fixing up the space for the studio.  The second step is to buy the specialized lights.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, where she is happy to receive financial support in order to progress in her business.  She pledges to make her payments punctually.  Her communal bank is comprised of responsible and supportive people.  Upon receiving your support Estefani will use the loan to buy lights, which cost an average of $500.

Ana is a seamstress, which she learned working for a tailoring business. But when she had her first son, she saw the need to be with him, and for this reason she could no longer go to work. \r\n\r\nBecause the salary earned by her husband wasn't enough to cover all the household expenses, Ana had the idea of continuing with her work but from her home, and in this way she could earn an income while at the same time staying home to care for her son. This is how she opened her own tailoring business, which little by little has grown in sales. With the business Ana has the means of contributing economically to her household, and can have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nBecause she started her business with very little capital, Ana is looking for a loan that will give her the opportunity to buy a coverstitch sewing machine. This will complete her shop and allow her to offer her clients completely finished garments. \r\n\r\nAna hopes that with this her income will increase significantly, as she will be able to offer her clients completed garments, when before they needed to be worked on by an intermediary. Ana hopes that with a higher income, her family will be able to enjoy a better quality of life and more economic opportunities; she dreams that her shop will grow, that she'll have steady work, and that she'll be able to offer employment to people who need it most.

Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Albeiro busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de un caballo para transportar sus productos y no tenerlos que cargar en su hombro hasta el sitio donde los entrega a sus clientes.\n\nAlbeiro espera que de esta manera pueda transportar de mejor manera sus productos, y as\u00ed pueda conservar su salud. Adem\u00e1s, como demorar\u00e1 menos tiempo en llevar sus productos hasta el sitio de entrega, podr\u00e1 entregar mayor cantidad de pedidos, pues actualmente debe negarse a entregar pedidos a sus clientes porque no le alcanza su tiempo para hacer todos los recorridos. Albeirot sue\u00f1a con poder tener un gran negocio y que este le permita sacar a su familia adelante, adem\u00e1s, sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y puedan en un futuro ser unos profesionales. \n","en":"Albeiro, in spite of all the adversities that life has presented him, has had the fortitude to advance and continue making progress, together with his family. From a very young age, he learned the work of the fields, since his parents always worked at this activity and they rapidly taught it to Albeiro. When his father died, he inherited the land where he now raises a great variety of fruits, and thanks to this he generates the income necessary to sustain his household. Albeiro is married and is the father of three children, to whom he has always wanted to offer a good education. In his business, he has a large number of customers, who guarantee him a very good level of sales. Nevertheless, Albeiro has the difficulty that he needs to deliver his products to his customers at a location that is very far from where he grows his products, and for this reason he has to carry them on his shoulders for a long time. Because of this, Albeiro has already experienced some health problems. With the spirit to improve this situation, Albeiro is seeking a loan, which will offer him the possibility of being able to purchase a horse to transport his products so that he won't have to carry them on his shoulders to the place where he delivers them to his customers.\r\n\r\nAlbeiro hopes that in this way he can transport his products in a better way, and thus he can preserve his health. In addition, as it will take less time to take his products to the delivery site, he will be able to fill a larger quantity of orders, since now he has to turn down some orders from his customers because he doesn't have enough time to make all the trips. Albeiro dreams of being able to have a large business and that this will allow him to move his family forward. Furthermore, he dreams that his children can have access to a quality education and in the future can have careers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1019307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

In the past, Gilberto had a mechanic's workshop with which he generated employment and through which he was able to offer his family a better quality of life. Nevertheless, because of violent conflicts in his community, he saw the need to move to another community, leaving all his work behind. With the passing of time, his community has improved the situation with regard to violence, and he was able to return again to his own home. There he has again set up his motorcycle workshop, where he also has a store where he sells parts, and thanks to this, he has re-established his business, his home, and the quality of life of his family. Thanks to the good quality of the products he sells and the repairs that he does in his shop, Gilberto is a well-known person, and this has permitted him to have very good sales. With the spirit to seek better productivity in his shop, Gilberto is looking for a loan that will make it possible for him to buy work tools that will make his shop more productive and allow him to fill all the orders of his customers.\r\n\r\nGilberto hopes that in this way he can offer his customers better service and thus his sales will increase considerably. In addition, he hopes to be able to again generate jobs for the people most in need and thus impact the quality of life of many more people. Gilberto has the great dream of having a shop that is authorized by a well-known brand of motorcycles, and in this way he can have better accreditation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1019347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Horacio se encuentra casado y tiene 3 hijos de 3, 6 y 10 a\u00f1os de edad, quienes siempre han sido su motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar fuertemente en su negocio. Hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os Horacio se dedica al transporte de materiales en una carroza halada por un caballo, sin embargo, debido a circunstancias ajenas a su voluntad, se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de dejar a un lado esta actividad y trabajar como empleado durante un tiempo. Gracias a que ha superado su dificultad, quiere retomar con su actividad de transportar materiales, la cual la hace como independiente y esto le genera mayores ingresos. Como ya tiene el coche de madera, Horacio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de un caballo con el cual pueda retomar su actividad del transporte de materiales. \n\nHoracio espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues durante el tiempo que trabaj\u00f3 como empleado su salario era muy bajo y no le alcanzaba para cubrir todas las necesidades de su familia. Horacio tiene el sue\u00f1o de que su familia pueda tener una mejor calidad de vida y tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1a con tener su casa propia y sacar adelante con un buen estudio a sus 3 hijos. \n","en":"Horacio is a person who has always had the strength to overcome the great adversities that he has faced in life.  Thanks to this, he has been able to keep progressing with his family.  He is married and has three children, who are three, six, and ten.  They have always been his motivation to work hard in his business.  For more than ten years, he has made a living transporting materials in a horse-drawn cart.  Nevertheless, due to circumstances outside of his control, he saw the need to stop this work and work as an employee for someone else for awhile.  Since he has overcome the problem, he wants to take up his transportation business again, which will make him independent and let him make more income.  Since he already has his wood cart, he is looking for a loan that will offer him the opportunity to buy a horse that will let him take up his business again.\r\n\r\nHoracio hopes that in this way, his income will increase considerably.  During the time that he worked for someone else, his wages were very low and he wasn't able to cover all of his family's needs.  Horacio's dream is that his family can have a better quality of life.  He also dreams about having his own home and letting his three children get ahead by giving them a good

Maria had a dream of being able to help people from other towns who wanted to study in her city, and got the opportunity by finding a place where she could house people at much lower rates than community hotels. In this way Maria opened up her home by renting out some rooms to out-of-towners with few resources who came to her city for a better education. Thanks to this activity, Maria has generated income to contribute to the household finances and offer her three children and her husband a better quality of life while at the same time improving the quality of life and providing better opportunities to others as well. In addition to this activity, Maria also sells personal-use products via catalog, which earns her extra income for her family. With the goal of doing her work more productively, Maria is requesting a loan so she can purchase household appliances that will make her job easier. Maria hopes that in this way she can increase her productivity and tend to a greater number of people, so she can grow her profits and also make an impact in more people's lives. Maria dreams in the not-too-distant future she can start up her own restaurant and provide employment to people in need while also improving her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1019472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase appliances to increase her productivity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Fe de Antioquia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":56995},{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58594},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":60238},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61928},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63666},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":65452},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":67288},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":69176},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":71117},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":73112},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75163},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77271}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.68,"local_amount":115678,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":121158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902543},{"amount":36.16,"local_amount":60893,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":63777.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326895},{"amount":35.94,"local_amount":60530,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63397.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378316},{"amount":77.05,"local_amount":129772,"processed_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135919.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432945},{"amount":6.33,"local_amount":10657,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11161.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617417},{"amount":86.23,"local_amount":145233,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":152113.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640344},{"amount":30.69,"local_amount":51691,"processed_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54139.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029420},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":106287,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":111322.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165568},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":41988,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":43977.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548088},{"amount":45.88,"local_amount":77271,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":80931.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098067}],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T12:03:56Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":403545,"name":"Chheng Leang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chheng Leang (in the photo), age 29, is a tailor.

I am a principled person guided by my own goals and objectives in life. I am adventurous and an achiever with a \"go-getter\u201d attitude. I love challenges in my day-to-day life. I am of the opinion that, if I want a better tomorrow, then I must start working on it today and now."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1057822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to purchase a laptop to help in data keeping, research and accessing coursework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":218,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42800.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":161.54,"local_amount":13169.24,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13423.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301513674},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":3292.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3355.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308499095},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":3292.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3355.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315708518},{"amount":132.74,"local_amount":10821.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":11030.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339632053},{"amount":93.76,"local_amount":7643.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7791.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364991238},{"amount":50.8,"local_amount":4141.21,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-19T09:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4221.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373389530},{"amount":5.4,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":448.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390686106}],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T17:43:45Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":408053,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti is a married woman.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

She decided to go into business because of her mother's influence; she used to help her mother out on the weekends when she was not in school. Radiatou really enjoys her work because she has a lot of merchandise and her customers are able to select from a wide variety. She is a member of one of one of the branches of UIMCEC and is requesting a loan of 300,000 francs. This loan will be used to buy cosmetics to increase her stock.

He started his business long ago on a movable wheelbarrow usually containing a tomato basket and one other basket of potatoes. He kept on this way for a long time and then developed a business to be opened in a small shop on the street where he now sells his vegetables instead of moving on a wheelbarrow. He took a youth loan of 80,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase enough vegetables to meet the demands of his clientele, which has expanded. This loan will allow him to purchase all types of vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, onions, etc and to build a good relationship with his clientele by serving their needs. In the future, Mohammed hopes to expand his business and improve his capital, as this will help in generating more income. He is also saving to buy a small truck, which he will use to bring his vegetables from the vegetable

She lives with them and her husband in her mother's house.\r\n\r\nCherli's business consists of buying and selling silver and gold jewelry, plus clothing and groceries in general. She sends money to the city of Lima and from there, they send products which she attempts to sell in her city among friends and neighbors. Cherli has been working for some 9 years on her own, and she has built up a very good customer list. Some 6 months ago she began selling groceries and the new investment is going well.\r\n\r\nCherli likes the work very much since it leaves her time for other activities. What she doesn't like is that at times, people delay paying. But she always has customers and the good thing is that since she now has years devoted to the business, she knows who to give credit to and who not to. Cherli would like, later on, to establish a silver and gold jewelry store in the city.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 5th loan through MFP. Cherli is very content to know that she will have financial aid, since she will feel more secure advancing her business.

Now she lives in her own home next to one of her daughters with whom she shares a lot. Clesi's work is selling candies. Every day she goes to the market seeking sweets, cookies, lollipops and other candies sought after in her business. She has a small storefront in her house where she shows and offers the different sweets to sweeten the day, as she tells us. She has had this business for 5 years. She started it because her husband passed away and she had to have some income to pay her expenses. Over time she got financially established and now she is starting to grow her business.   \r\n\r\nShe likes her work because it is very relaxing for her, since she can talk to people. Her favorite customers are the children, because she can play and have fun with them. She hopes to keep working because she wants to get the money together to open a bigger candy store. This will be her fourth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support, because she will feel safe going ahead in her business.

She is married with three children. Her husband is a civil servant and two of her children study at university. The other one goes to high school. She began her business life when her children's educational expenses increased. She wasn't happy with only her husband working, because she wanted to contribute to her family\u2019s budget, so she stepped into the business world. Firstly, she started to work in a textile factory. At the beginning of her job in the textile factory, she did delivery and shift work. She found the job hard, but she didn't give up because if she quit her job, she wouldn't be able to support her children's education, and she was encouraged by this thought. \n\nAfter that, she got the best job opportunity of her life. She partnered with the owner of a tailor shop with the help of someone close to her. She dedicated herself to this job. Later, her partner opened a new shop, so Fatma became the owner of the original shop. \n\nHer biggest dream is to be an expert at her job and she wants to make her own shop a fashion house. She doesn't want her husband's contribution, because she wants to do everything by herself. She financed the rest of the shop with the Maya loan, as well as repairing the machines in the shop. She appreciates the Maya loan through Kiva and has shown that she has developed her business and is determined to continue to do so in the future.\n\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Volunteers\n\nFatma Hanim 1970 Sivrihisar do\u011fumlu.

She is a married woman with three kids. Despite her young age, she manages to take good care of her family and kids. She got to know about Maya when she was selling cosmetics products from her house in order to support and contribute to her family. Her husband was working at Pinar, a Turkish water company. However as time passed, Asli and her husband decided to start their own business. They decided that whatever they did, Asl\u0131 would be able to work and to take care of her children at the same time. They decided to do what they knew best so they opened a distributing agency for a water company. This way her husband would keep doing his job and Asli would answer customers' phone calls. Asl\u0131 also could have her children with her at the store. \n\nAsl\u0131 and her husband had financial difficulties, but they managed to open their distributing agency. With the loan from Maya, they are able to develop their business further. They are managing to reach more customers. Their dream is to buy other distribution outlets in Eskisehir so that their agency will be one of the main distributing agencies in the area. With this loan, Asli will buy 5 gallon bottled drinking water in bulk for their water distribution store. This business they've started means a lot to them since it is a way to improve their family's living standards.\n \nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Volunteers\n\nAsl\u0131 Han\u0131m, 1982 Eski\u015fehir do\u011fumlu evli ve 3 \u00e7ocuk annesi.Gen\u00e7 ya\u015f\u0131na ra\u011fmen 3 \u00e7ocu\u011funun sorumlulu\u011funu en iyi \u015fekilde yerine getirmeye \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131yor.

Pilar's work is raising poultry. She has two sheds very close to the city and she goes there every day with her spouse to check on and feed her animals. Her average production is 1,500 chickens every 45 days, which is the average time needed to raise the chicks to be ready for market. She has dome this job for approximately 5 years and it is something she learned little by little. She likes her work because it gives her time to do more things. She only uses half the day to be in her sheds and the rest of the day she is at home with her children helping them with anything they need. Every day she is more convinced that the work she does is good, since she has a lot of regular customers who wait for her monthly production because her chickens are big, plump and healthy. Now she is preparing to have one more shed and she is convinced that with her hard work she will keep growing. This will be her 13th loan with MFP. She hopes for your cooperation to continue with her goals. She is also committed to making her payments on time as with the previous loans. She also wants to keep working with the members of the communal bank because they are all kind and supportive. With the 4000 soles she has asked for, she will buy chicks to raise. She will also replace some things in the sheds where she raises her birds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1019536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicks and materials to raise chickens.

I harvest 120, 60-kilo sacks from my parcels and do very well,\u201d she comments.\r\n\r\nShe plants in several parcels at a distance from her location.  The quality of the coffee varies according to the altitude.  In the lower elevations (around her house) the coffee beans are sold for 40 c\u00e9ntimos and in the higher elevations (mountains) for 60 c\u00e9ntimos.  It\u2019s advantageous to plant in the mountains but it also requires more care and product has to be transported from that zone which also implies extra cost.  Fortunately, buyers come to her community to acquire her products so she saves on shipping and labor costs.\r\n\r\nThis would be her first loan with MFP so she gives her word that she will be punctual with her monthly installment payments.

This numerous but united family lives in a house of their own in the indigenous community of Yavirironi, R\u00edo Negro District-Satipo.  \r\n\r\nVirgilio started farming 20 years ago; his specialty is cocoa bean production.  His family needs pushed him to acquire more land where he now grows coffee.  Two years still have to pass before his coffee produces its first beans; Virgilio is excited.  \u201cCocoa bean sales are profitable.  Each year I harvest 5 sacks of 70 kilos each,\u201d he says.  His best sales take place in the city of Satipo which is why he mostly lives there capturing customers.\r\n\r\nVirgilio is an intelligent man.  With all of his knowledge about the fields he manages to support and educate his five children.  He still has many goals to reach, like seeing his children become independent people, and he will not rest until they do so.  He now plans to open a small grocery store that his children can run when they are on vacation.\r\n\r\nThis would be his first loan with MFP so he commits to being punctual with his monthly installment payments.  He also mentions that he feels happy to be part of the new \u201cInkani\u201d communal bank.  With the money he will be able to open a small grocery store at home.  To do so he will buy groceries, soft-drinks and snacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1019665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise to stock his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":803.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455766}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T14:51:51Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":404775,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Touch (in the photo) and her husband, Hay, live on an island in the Mekong River, about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

From a very young age, Yeimi started working in grocery stores because her family has had that type of business and she acquired experience there.  \r\n\r\nOne day she decided to open her own general store where she sells basic staple items and thanks to this she contributes economically to her home\u2019s income.
