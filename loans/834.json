She plans to invest a portion of her profits from this loan to purchase construction materials to repair a shed, and to further expand her business in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1062730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarysogot village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Taalaibu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":860}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":645,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":30187.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329738},{"amount":645,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30187.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776833},{"amount":860,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40250.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467830671}],"funded_date":"2012-04-24T07:12:50Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T10:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":405087,"name":"Yusra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusra is a 43-year-old married woman from Al Hasmi, Amman; Jordan and a mother of nine children. \r\n\r\nYusra is selling clothes and working from her home.

She is part of a group called \"Hortensias\", because Do\u00f1a Martina loves these flowers and decided to give that name to the group.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working and enterprising woman, who goes out daily to the villages living near her area to sell seasonal fruits and vegetables such as avocado, lettuce, green chili peppers, tomatoes, cactus, plantains, mandarins, oranges, beans, and apples, peaches, melons, guavas, and more.  She comments that she began this vegetable business more than 19 years ago to help her husband with the household expenses.  She also notes that she sells in different markets around her community.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Martina says that the loan that the Fundaci\u00f3n is giving her will be invested in various fruits and vegetables.  She says that she is very happy about this loan, because sales are high right now as she has been going to other locations to sell with her son, who helps her.  She says that she stocks up on fruits and vegetables in the central supply store in the village of Zitacuaro, where they give her low prices so that she can make some profit.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have a stable stall in one of the village markets, so that she doesn't have to spend so much on transporting her products.  She says that she is very grateful for the loans which the financing institution has made to her, because her business has been growing bit by bit.  \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are called Lazaro, Rosalba and Leopoldo.  They will invest their loans in their businesses: a stationery store, a grocery store, and buying and selling second-hand clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1034921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables such as avocado, lettuce, green chili peppers, tomatoes, cactus, plantains, mandarins, oranges, beans, and apples, peaches, melons, guavas, and more","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":5175,"lender_count":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lazaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leopoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5803.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6131.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6264.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6399.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6537.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6678.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6822.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6969.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7120.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7273.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":501.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":546.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":558.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1928.74,"local_amount":24598.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":24691.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656761},{"amount":1036.23,"local_amount":13215.72,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13265.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317433},{"amount":1081.43,"local_amount":13792.14,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13844.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418817},{"amount":1128.6,"local_amount":14393.74,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14447.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568410}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T14:09:23Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":409833,"name":"Nube Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nube Luz tiene 45 a\u00f1os  de edad y vive con su familia en una comunidad de la provincia de Guanacaste llamada Guaitil.

Together, they are able to generate an income of 10 USD each day to cover the family\u2019s daily expenses.\r\n\r\nShe now would like to borrow some funds from Kiva, through HKL, to pay for land preparation and to buy crop seeds to sow over her farmland. She hopes to have a good harvest in the following months with the support from our lenders. She is determined to pay her loan back regularly and punctually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1043674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They all live in the home that she owns in the rural community of Yavirironi, R\u00edo Negro Distrcit \u2013 Satipo.  Esther is an organized and hardworking woman.  She has been making her living in agriculture for more than 20 years.  She has 3 plots of land on which she plants coffee, cacao and annatto.  Producing these three products is very profitable, but each harvest is annual. Esther plants her fields in such a way that the harvests coincide with the months of greatest expense.  For example, she harvests the coffee in May and June, the cacao in April, May and June and the annatto in October and November.  That way they have the money to invest in other plantings.\r\n\u201cI have been farming coffee for 10 years.  Now I am harvesting 12 sacks.  The cacao gives me 350 kilos a year,\u201d she says.\r\nOne of her problems is low prices.  Annatto is getting 4 soles per kilo, but in better times gets 7 or 8 soles per kilo.  Thanks to her other crops, she can compensate for said inconvenience.\r\nEsther is currently thinking of renewing her coffee crop with a new crop of small coffee plants.  This will be her first loan from MFP, and so she promises to be punctual with her monthly payments.  She is happy to be a part of the communal bank \u201cInkani\u201d, whose members are responsible people.\r\nEsther will invest the money in the purchase of 10,000 little coffee plants to renew her crop.  With the rest, she will pay the day laborers who will help her with this strenuous work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1019704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 10,000 little coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455774}],"funded_date":"2012-04-03T22:04:45Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":399784,"name":"Blanca Ines","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca es una persona que a pesar de todas las adversidades que le ha presentado la vida, ha tenido la fortaleza para salir adelante y continuar progresando.

Mrs. Srey and her husband help each other in the farming business. From this occupation, they are able to make revenue of around 4 USD per day to use for the family\u2019s expenses. \n\nThis couple has given birth to four children: three of the children are married and one is single. One of the children is grocery seller in a market of Phnom Penh city. She sells groceries, including household things especially materials for using in the kitchen.

She is a very responsible woman and for that reason, does not permit minors to enter her establishment. Maria has always upheld social norms and respected her obligations. Her business is located in her house where she prepared a space for attending to her customers. Previously, her business was located in her parents' house, but because business was growing and she wanted to have her own house, for the last 2 years she has lived and worked in her house.\r\n\r\nMaria likes her work since it allows her to enjoy some moments of relaxation in which she can take care of household matters.

She is also happy and friendly.  She is in a common-law marriage with Eduardo, who transports cargo for a living.  He is the father of their 8 children, the majority of which are now independent.  She lives with her youngest son, Javier, who is 30, in their own home.  Elva raises chickens.  She has a small shed that has a maximum capacity of 200 chickens, which is located in back of her home.  There she raises them and sells them at markets in the area, managing to sell all of her production.\r\n\r\nElva stated her business with her own capital that was the fruit of her savings more than 33 years ago.  She also has the support of Eduardo, who is in charge of cleaning and feeding the chickens.  She considers her business to be rather profitable due to the demand that this product has.  It is consumed in mass as part of the daily diet of the population.  What she likes most about her job is being able to have extra economic income for her home's expenses.  On the other hand, what she doesn't like is that sometimes part of her production dies due to plagues, and she has occasional losses.  This is why she had to start over thanks to the support of Microfinanzas Prisma.  She has plans to continue her work and to make some repairs and improvements to her shed.  This will be her twelfth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she hopes that through it she can make her plans concrete.  She will make all of her payments on time so she can have a good credit record.  She feels very good about her communal bank.  She thinks the members are sociable and supportive.  With the requested amount of 1,000 PEN, she will invest in the repair of her shed's infrastructure.  She will buy bijao leaves to update the roof and wood chips for the floor where she will have close to 100 baby chicks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1021310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bijao leaves and wood chips to reconstruct her shed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":172.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.58,"local_amount":145.54,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":145.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714073},{"amount":60.18,"local_amount":160.48,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":160.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202972},{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":159.87,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":160.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098644},{"amount":64.66,"local_amount":172.42,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":172.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401487},{"amount":67.07,"local_amount":178.85,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":179.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455788},{"amount":68.56,"local_amount":182.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451455}],"funded_date":"2012-04-09T16:18:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":400193,"name":"Meyga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Meyga, de 30 a\u00f1os, es una mujer amable, buena y emprendedora, es conviviente con Manuel de 30 a\u00f1os con quien tiene dos hijos, Joao de 10 y Luana de 2 a\u00f1os.

During her spare time she leaves home to sell to her friends, neighbors, relatives and the other customers she has attracted over the two years  she has been engaged in the shoe business.\r\n\r\nDuring her working hours many things happen and she learns from each experience, since she is a woman who continues to learn every day and then applies what she learns to improving her character and her service to her customers. She greatly enjoys her work since it enables her plenty of free time to spend with her children and husband.\r\n\r\nIn recent months her sales have greatly improved. Consequently she would like to increase her capital to cover all of her customer\u2019s sales orders. This will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy to know she will have financial help so that she can continue increasing her working capital. As well, she is sure that she will continue being as good and responsible a member as she was with loans she obtained previously.\r\n\r\nMeyga enjoys belonging to the communal bank, which works because all the women are responsible and supportive of one another.

Estardo lives with Margarita and Efra\u00edn, whom he loves very much, in their own home.  He makes a living selling groceries.  He has a small store in their home, where he attends to the needs of his neighbors, who are his main customers.  He also fishes with a small boat.  He considers his grocery business to be very profitable since there isn't a similar business in their area.  He likes his job.  Attending to the public distracts him, but more importantly, he feels productive because he can pay for his home's expenses.  He has plans to expand and convert his store into a mini-market where he can sell a variety of products.  This will be his third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He is happy to be able to have their support.  He promises to make all of his payments on time.  With the requested amount of 4,000 PEN, he will invest half in the purchase of basic groceries to stock his store so it will be able to keep growing.

She's separated from the father of her four children - Monica, 28; Luis, 26; Walter, 21; and Nancy, 14. She lives comfortably with her children in the home she owns. Doris's work is selling food like daily prepared breakfasts. She works every day in front of her home, where she amiably tends to her customers, mostly her neighbors and passersby whose preference she has won. She started more than 28 years ago with her own capital, and later took out bank loans that allowed her to continue with her work. Now she has the support of an assistant to prepare the food and attend to the customers who pay per work week. Her business is pretty profitable and gives her a good income. \r\n\r\nShe likes her business a lot because she enjoys cooking and making new types of meals to surprise her customers. What she wants most right now is to increase the size of her business and open a restaurant in her home where she can give her customers more comfort. This will be her 13th loan with MFP. She hopes for a small loan to help her achieve her objectives. For her part, she promises once again to make her payments as she did with previous loans. She is grateful to be part of the village bank because all of the members are responsible and united. With the requested 2000 nuevos soles she will buy cooking implements as well as tables and chairs to grow and improve her business and give her customers better service. She will also fix her roof because it rains a lot in that area."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1021379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking implements, tables and chairs, and to fix the roof on her building.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T04:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":290.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":319.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":344.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":366.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.11,"local_amount":290.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":291.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714074},{"amount":120.32,"local_amount":320.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":321.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202974},{"amount":121.11,"local_amount":322.97,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":323.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098645},{"amount":128.01,"local_amount":341.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401489},{"amount":134.09,"local_amount":357.57,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":358.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455790},{"amount":137.36,"local_amount":366.29,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":367.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451457}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T02:03:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":405397,"name":"Khuth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khuth lives in Dongkor commune, Phnom Penh city.

Cambodia. Out of her 7 children, she needs to be responsible for 4 children. Her residential area is the place in which rice farming is one of the common businesses among the villagers, as well as for Pich's family. She and her husband have been farming for 20 years for the sake of her family.

the residents in the rural village of the Tbaung Khmum District, Cambodia. She earns a living via growing rice on one hectare of farmland and on one hectare of plantation for cash crop. She has experience in those businesses for 18 years and she can earn about 3.25 USD per day. \r\n\r\nHer first loan with VisionFund was in 2011. Her effort in improving her business enabled her to repay back the entire loan successfully. As the result, Leang has managed to improve her living condition and to own a motorbike as the transportation means for her household as well as for business purposes.

On the other hand, Alejandra\u2019s work is very tranquil because with the sales she\u2019s able to cover her household\u2019s expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy grocery items to stock her store with products so that she won\u2019t lack anything and will always present a good appearance.  This is her loan #1 with MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity being provided since she\u2019ll be able to reach her objectives thanks to it.  Also, she commits to be punctual with her payments.  She will use the requested loan to buy foodstuffs and other products to stock her store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1021433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic staple items to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":209.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":220.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":222.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":241.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":261.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":269.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":279.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":288.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":298.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.89,"local_amount":429.05,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":430.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714078},{"amount":82.6,"local_amount":220.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":220.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202978},{"amount":172.73,"local_amount":460.63,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":461.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401493},{"amount":184.66,"local_amount":492.41,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":493.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451461},{"amount":97.99,"local_amount":261.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":262.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446641},{"amount":102.88,"local_amount":274.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":275.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052656},{"amount":102.99,"local_amount":274.63,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":275.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571831},{"amount":108.36,"local_amount":288.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":289.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121623},{"amount":111.9,"local_amount":298.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":299.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869248}],"funded_date":"2012-04-25T22:40:03Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":400562,"name":"Maria Lucely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es una persona que se ha caracterizado por ser muy trabajadora y siempre tener fortaleza para superar las adversidades que le ha presentado la vida.

Mar\u00eda is married and has two children who are 3 and 6 years old that she\u2019s always wanted to offer a good quality of life to.  Because Mar\u00eda\u2019s husband\u2019s income was insufficient to cover all household expenses, she started a business selling food hoping to generate income and contribute economically.  The fast food business generated good income for a time but due to circumstances beyond her control she had to close it.  Since then, Mar\u00eda has sought ways to be able to contribute economically to her home so that her family would be able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis led to her setting up a sewing workshop motivated by teachings she received from a family member on how to do this activity and thanks to it she can today count on higher income for her home.  She provides sewing services for third parties in her shop and thanks to the good quality of her work has had very good sales.  So much so that she needs to hire an employee for her shop so is looking for a loan so that she can buy an overlock sewing machine to provide work tools for the person she\u2019s going to hire.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes that in this way she will be able to improve the quality of life not only of her family but also for other people who are more in need.  In addition, Mar\u00eda hopes that her business will continue growing and generating more employment for people in need.  Mar\u00eda dreams with having a great workshop with all the necessary machinery to carry out all her activities and that her family will be able to enjoy a better quality of life and greater opportunities to make progress thanks to it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1021854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Despite that, she took the initiative, along with her husband\u2019s help, and started her juice business from a leased stall.\r\n\r\nMadelina is happy with her business because she has steady customers who always come by to drink the juices that she prepares.  In the future she plans to open her own shop.  This will be her first loan through MFP and she is committed to making her payments on time.  Madalina is grateful for the opportunity to start this communal group.  She will use the 1,000 PEN to buy a blender and juicer, along with a supply of fruit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1021405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a blender and fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T16:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":109.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":118.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":131.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":136.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.1,"local_amount":224.26,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":224.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714077},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":118.71,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":119.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202977},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":122.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098648},{"amount":47.71,"local_amount":127.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":127.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401492},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":131.22,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":131.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455793},{"amount":51.01,"local_amount":136.01,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":136.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451460},{"amount":52.67,"local_amount":140.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":140.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446640}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T02:12:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Rosa is a young woman who has been working selling articles of clothing in the town of Omaya for three years now. She tells us that before she started this business she supported her mother in selling groceries, where she gained business experience. For this reason she has no difficulties in serving customers.\r\n\r\nThe articles that she sells are acquired in the capital, Lima, where she has providers who supply her in accordance with the orders she may have. In the beginning she made her sales by going around to street fairs in her town or on Sundays in the market. Now she has a rented stall in the market where she offers her wares, but she still goes out to the nearby communities, taking her products to where her regular customers are.\r\n\r\nRosa is happy with this work that she carries out because it generates a good financial income thanks to the effort she puts into her daily sales. Going forward, she is thinking of continuing with the business that she has. This is her first loan through MFP, which is why she has committed to settling her repayments punctually.

She tells us that it wasn't very easy starting this business because she didn't have enough capital since she was working as a day laborer in agriculture, receiving minimum wage without being able to finance her son's education. It is for this reason that a brother of hers helped her get a loan which Sonia used to open her small general store. Little by little it grew, thanks to the dedication and meticulousness that she has. Currently Sonia has overcome this; her store is well supplied with products that are basic necessities so that her customers can always find everything.

Adem\u00e1s, espera salir adelante con su cultivo y que este le permita ofrecer a su familia una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas. \n","en":"Luis Fernando has always seen it as a great advantage to be able to work independently, since this way he does not have to observe a strict responsibility for a job that may be poorly paid.  That is why ever since he learned to farm he has made a living by growing his crops and from this he generates the income needed for his home.  \r\n\r\nLuis Fernando is married and has one son for whom he has always wanted to provide a college education. However, financial difficulties have made this something he has had to postpone for some time.  \r\n\r\nWanting to increase his crops, Luis Fernando is requesting a loan that will provide him with the chance to buy supplies he needs to be able to work on his farm.  Luis Fernando hopes that in this way his monthly income will not be affected by purchasing the supplies he needs for his farm.  Furthermore, he hopes to move ahead with his farm and thus be able to offer his family a better quality of life and better economic opportunities.

Sofa is a woman who never rests.  In spite the fact that she is older, she continues to devote herself to doing what she enjoys, which is farming.  Ever since she was young she has cultivated potatoes and vegetables.  But the work that suits her best is buying and selling potatoes, peas, carrots, lettuce, etc.  She started doing this 2 years ago. \"Before I used to farm, but it is tiring.  Now I travel to Chanchamayo (in the central forest) to sell,\" she says.  Every week, Sofa acquires 20 sacks of potatoes, 10 sacks of peas and some vegetables.  Her children help her with this work, and because of this she is comfortable with this activity.  She sells all of this merchandise from a sales post in the Chanchamayo market.  In addition, for 5 years she has also been making cheese.  Each week she sells 80 cheese molds.

She has two children and has been selling perfume, cosmetics, and cleansers for 6 years.  She sells the products every day door to door.  She tells us that the challenge she faces is that she does not have her own shop to be able to offer her products.  The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase more perfume and cleansers.  She also needs to find a location where she can sell her products.  This is a way she can generate more capital and earnings that will help her children with their education.

At the age of only 15 she began to work in this department store, and she did it while studying in the morning and working in the afternoon.  In this way she generated the income necessary to cover her own expenses and contribute economically to the expenses of her home, where she lives with her parents.\r\n\r\nThanks to this she began to work at a very young age.  She learned the job quickly and so managed to take advantage of the opportunity to buy the stationery store when her former boss offered to sell it to her.

In addition, she hopes that with a greater variety of products her customers will find more reasons to shop in her store, and in this way her income will continue to increase more all the

He sells mattresses, reeds, plastic bathtubs, brooms, etc.) in installments so he goes to the capital twice a week to buy and he does her the favor of bringing her the products she needs because sometimes firms that sell the product don\u2019t come to her place.  However, she is asking for this loan to invest in her business purchasing soft-drinks, snacks, juice, beans, rice, etc. Since her husband hasn\u2019t done too well with his business they want to enlarge the store to obtain better profits and support their children\u2019s schooling.  \r\n\r\nThe other member sells new and used traditional clothes and needs the loan to invest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1027370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic staple food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Juan Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":1333.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1358.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206896},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":679.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315927},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":679.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850845},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":679.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551683},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":679.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377940}],"funded_date":"2012-04-04T01:09:30Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":406747,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan lives in Yei.

While looking for a source of income for her family Gulzat started her business in 2008 doing animal husbandry with a starting capital of 20,000 som (KGS). Today Gulzat's business has one horse, five sheep, five goats and two cows bringing around 10,000 KGS monthly from the sale of milk and dairy products. The desire to save some money for her children's education pushed Gulzat to expand her business and open a food stall. With the goal to increase her working capital Gulzat has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 75,000 KGS which will let her expand the variety of products and acquire new customers. Gulzat plans to partially invest the income from the loan to buy building materials to build a shed for the livestock and partially into the growth of her retail

She lives in a house that is her own property.\r\n\r\nThe work Florinda does is selling bananas, for which she has equipped a table in the front part of her house and waits on her customers.  The majority of them are her own neighbors, whom she serves cordially and pleasantly, to gain their friendship.  She has been working in this job for more than three years, with a loan from MFP and having the help of her children in buying the product and waiting on the customers in their free time.  She considers her business worthwhile for the profits it gives her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job, which allows her to have an income with which to be able to help her partner with the household expenses, because she had to leave her job taking care of children because of her advanced age.  She hopes to be able to support her business and continue having her daily means of support, because she will not be able to find a job because of her age.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with the MFP institution.  She is contented and grateful for the opportunity given, which has meant a lot to her when she most needed it.  She wants to continue having this support and she will continue being punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nWith the requested total of 1200 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in buying bananas, looking for low prices for her bulk purchases, taking advantage of the fact that this product is scarce and the prices are on the rise.  In this way she will have greater profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1034707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":205.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.82,"local_amount":367.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":367.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714101},{"amount":74.25,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":198.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203000},{"amount":77.02,"local_amount":205.39,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":205.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098670},{"amount":78.36,"local_amount":208.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":208.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401515},{"amount":82.55,"local_amount":220.13,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":220.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455813}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T22:55:32Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":402760,"name":"Fortin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fortin, de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es un hombre alegre y activo, adem\u00e1s de ser empe\u00f1oso y trabajador.

He has the help of his uncle on occasions when he is away from the house.\r\n\r\nHe considers his business profitable because of the earnings that it provides him. His business allows him to have an income for his personal expenses, such as his higher-level education, and to help with the household expenses. He likes to serve his neighbors and socialize with them. On the other hand, what he doesn't like about his business is that he sees it as small. He wants to be able to make it grow more, to have greater earnings, and for this reason he has plans to stock his business with a greater variety of products.

She is happy and sociable and she enjoys business.  She is living with Biviano, who makes a living in transportation, and who is the father of her three children:  Leydi (8), Julio (4) and Greysi (1).  All of them live comfortably in their own house, which she worked hard to purchase with her father-in-law.  \r\n\r\nThe work that Gisela does is rent internet stations.  She has five well-installed computers, which are very busy since it\u2019s the only business of its kind in the area.  It is located in a spot in her own house that is in good condition, and she does a good job of taking care of her customers.  She launched this business over a year ago, starting with three machines with her own capital. Later, due to demand, she acquired two computers, which resulted in growing her business a little more.  Over time, she has become very well-known.  \r\n\r\nFor this activity she relies on the support of her spouse, who supports her in his spare time, and during the mornings she attends to the business.  She enjoys her work, which allows her to earn regular income to support her family and to be able to pay for her childrens\u2019 studies, which fills her with pride.  In addition, she supports her spouse with expenses.  \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of demand for her business, and even more during peak hours, since there is a shortage of computers and her place is filled with users who are mostly from her area.  For that reason, she would like to grow and increase her business.  \r\n\r\nShe is also in the process of opening a new business - a poultry shop - which she is installing next to the internet stations.  Right now she is awaiting the arrival of the oven and the shop's opening in just two weeks, which will generate more income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan number 3 with the institution MPF.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on this financial support to develop her business, so she is committed to being responsible with the repayment of her loans, like she was with the previous credit.\r\n\r\nWith the loan which she has applied for 3500 nuevos soles (monetary denomination for Peru),  she will buy computer keyboards, mice, internet cables and other accessories for computers, since she tells us that due to the constant use of the current ones, they are worn out.  She will also invest the balance in the purchase of tables, chairs and utensils for the new poultry shop business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1020202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy computer mice, keyboards and other accessories for the PC, as well as utensils to launch her poultry shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":221.99},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":240.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":278.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":295.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":309.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":320.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":334.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":347.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":356.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175.15,"local_amount":462.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":468.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714061},{"amount":96.44,"local_amount":254.76,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":257.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098632},{"amount":202.95,"local_amount":536.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":542.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401475},{"amount":107.26,"local_amount":283.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":286.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446634},{"amount":743.2,"local_amount":1963.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1987.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869247}],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T22:54:42Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Wong","image":1005634}},{"id":400161,"name":"Edson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edson, de 28 a\u00f1os, es un hombre honesto, trabajador y responsable, es soltero y no tiene hijos, vive en casa de sus padres. \u00c9l trabaja mucho pues desea brindar lo mejor a sus padres a quienes apoya en los gastos del hogar.

He enjoys his business because it allows him to provide a better lifestyle for his small children who he loves very much.  The income also covers household expenses.  What he does not like is the rain because it makes selling his products difficult.  He depends on the climate as far as sales are concerned, but this does not affect his plans to increase beverage product variety and set up a company where he can be a prosperous business owner.  \r\n\r\nThis is his third loan through MFP and he is hoping a small loan will help him meet his goals.  He is comfortable with his communal bank because all the members are responsible and caring.

Mauricio raises chickens and also works as a motor-taxi driver to earn a living to provide for his sons.  Since his chicken business was started with only a small amount of capital, Mauricio is seeking a loan to buy 50 more chickens and to renovate a basement for two more chicken pens.\r\n\r\nMauricio hopes to increase the number of chickens he sells to increase his income.

She lives with Juan Carlos, her husband of one year. They have a small son who's 4 months old and whom they love very much. His name is Carlos Cruz. For now they live in the home of her mother, located in La Florida. When she began to work with the association she was a young worker who fought to get her mother and siblings ahead. Now that she has her own family she plans on doing the same together with her son and husband. She makes a living selling beauty products of a brand that's well-known on the global level. She does this by means of catalogs where her clients see what they like and then make their orders. During this time she was able to obtain products in stock and because of this she already has a secure financial capital. But the most profitable financial activity is centered around raising chicken, which she sells together with her mother to a well-known restaurant in the city. She says that she and her mother are planning on setting up a very large space that she has in her home where they can raise more chicken and in this way supply the orders they have. She is already planning strategies to make this project a reality. She belongs to the solidarity group \"Tambo al progreso\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very thankful for all the people who make the money possible as it allows many people like her to get ahead. After receiving support, Jakeline will invest the requested money in the purchase of 400 small chicken to begin her

So that it does not die without a copy, it is that for the first three months she strengthens them with vitamins and injections in order to prevent sickness.  \"I care for them like my children,\" she says.

Her business is doing well since she sells to a well known restaurant and to regular customers who are connoisseurs in the good quality of its meat.  \r\n\r\nNow, she wants to increase the raising of chickens by double.
