The eldest is still single and working, and the youngest is out of school. \r\n\r\nLeticia is raising four hogs, fattening them for future sale. According to her, the price of feeds nowadays is high, and that\u2019s the reason why her income is no longer enough to buy the needed supplies for her hogs. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Leticia is requesting additional capital in the amount of P20,000, which will be used to purchase stock feeds for her hog raising. She hopes to obtain the requested loan amount in order to fully nourish the growth of her hogs. In this way, she could sell them for a greater profit, which will serve in improving her way of living.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the business picture, wearing a blue polo shirt, is the project

At the beginning the government selected her to teach in town, Ajoyanca, which is far from the city.  She worked there all year, and she received a monthly salary.  However, as an enterprising woman who is eager to help other people, she opened a business selling clothes in her town.\r\n\r\nBecause the town\u2019s inhabitants are far away, they do not have constant access to the city.  Lilia took this problem as an opportunity to be able to get extra income and to help the families in her town.  That is how she started to carry good quality and, and above all, inexpensive clothes to sell to her neighbors.  She is decreasing the expense of traveling constantly to buy basic needs products.\r\n\r\nShe has now requested her transfer to the city of Huancavelica, one of the poorest in the country.  She hopes to teach preschool there.  She also hopes to be able to continue her work of selling clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.

She graduated from a university with the Kyrgyz-language and literature teaching degree and currently works as an assistant director of the school in the Namatbek village.  Kulbara has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1994, having started this business with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  At the present time, her business yields about 11,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.  Also, Kulbara works on 4.40 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows potatoes, beans and apples.  In order to further develop her business, Kulbara requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into expanding her business.

She works as a Kyrgyz language and literature teacher.  Sozulkan became involved in animal husbandry 16 years ago, having started this business with an initial amount of 18,000 som (KGS).

She lives with her daughter, 21 year old Katy, in a home of her own, located in Palcamayo \u2013 Tarma.  Celia is a very communicative woman.  She tells us that she has had to endure much work in order to be able to have what she has.  As a girl, she would help her parents with the farming and the livestock.  She later began baking bread, cakes, and other foods and she worked in a bakery for more than 10 years.  Through all of her efforts she was able to save enough money to buy land of her own, where she raises peas, potatoes, beans, and spices.  She would take her products to the country\u2019s central jungle, so she built her house there, but since she lives in Tarma, she rents out the rooms to other people, which brings her income.  At the moment she has a grocery store that she runs out of her home.  This is how she got started buying and selling land.  She says, \u201cSales are sporadic, so my store helps me a lot.\u201d\r\n\r\nCelia is seeing her goals come true, now that her daughter has completed her higher education and will be able to support herself with no problem.  She is happy.  This will be her 11th loan through MFP.  She is very grateful for all the support she has gotten over the years.  She is a member of the \u201cPatr\u00f3n San Crist\u00f3bal\u201d communal bank and she talks about the importance that the group has had in developing her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1037381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T16:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T16:30:22Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1533.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446671}],"funded_date":"2012-04-07T02:17:21Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

In all this time she has had both good experiences and several disappointments, but nothing compared to the death of her daughter at 33 years old.  For this reason, she has great love for her granddaughter who was orphaned.\r\n\r\nShe has the strength required to grow lima beans, peas, spinach, carrots, lettuce and other vegetables.  However, she always needs more hands, so she hires workers to streamline her activities.  She also works looking after small animals such as guinea-pigs, hens, a ram and donkeys, which she raises so that she can sell them at a later point to butchers and neighbors in her area.

She now lives with two children who are still school age in a house of her own in the Yanama Alto settlement, Palca-Tarma District.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been farming for 23 years growing peas and all varieties of potato.  According to her, she has several parcels of farmland located in her district and along the Peruvian coast (she grows potatoes there with seeds she takes from her birthplace).  Mid-year which is when harvests are large she heads to the city of Lima to sell what she produces.  Another activity that produces benefits for her is raising livestock.  \r\n\r\nShe tills the land with help from her two bullocks and she sells the milk her cows produce and also makes cheese with it. In addition, she opened a grocery and basic staples store at home a year ago.

As part of my degree, we are required to undertake units in computer, system analysis, web developments and networking.

That is why she is always up to date with the production of her cocoa and coconut plants.  She takes her harvest to sell to the storage warehouses.  They pay her good earnings for each kilo.  With her income from the harvests she manages to pay her children\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is why she comes to the MFP offices to request a loan to help complete her work plans.  This will be her second loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue being punctual as she was with the previous loan that she had.  In her communal bank she is a responsible and supportive member.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy agrochemicals to keep her crops fertile.

During harvest time they have the help of their oldest children, as well as hired workers, who help pick the fruit quickly, so that they are able to sell to the agricultural associations that buy cacao at a good price.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest dream is to have crops of coffee and coca, but for now what they want to do is fumigate their plants in order to insure a good crop in their next harvest. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has taken out through MFP and she is happy to know she has financial support. As a member of her communal bank, she is thankful to have been given the opportunity to work with responsible and united individuals. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she has requested, she will buy insecticides and fertilizer to be able to provide maintenance to her crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1039169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy insecticides and fertilizer.

Like all the farmers at harvest time, he needs the support of day labourers so that they can harvest the fruit quicker. After they harvest it, they take it to sell in the closest distribution centre in his area. What he most likes about his work is being able to depend on his own fruit and give himself a good economic livelihood, and what he finds difficult is having to transport his crops as the sacks are heavy. With time, his goal is to have his own house; it is because of this that he is now prioritising the production of his crops by carrying out maintenance and increasing his plants.

She is in a common-law marriage with Jes\u00fas, who works for a company and is the father of their 3 children.  The oldest is already independent and doesn't live with her.  She lives with Jes\u00fas and their 2 youngest children:  Mary, 25, and Jes\u00fas, 14.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Estela has a business selling soft drinks.  She has a refrigerator that she bought with Jes\u00fas' help, and they put it in their home, where she attends to her customers.  She has run this business for more than 1 year.  Seeing that their home was lacking financially, she started the business because of Jes\u00fas' idea.  He advised her to start it, observing that it was in demand because of the hot climate in the area.  She decided to continue with it.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it lets her have an economic income to support Jes\u00fas with their home's expenses.  It also lets her be at home so she can care for and attend to her children, whom she loves very much and of whom she wants to take good care.  They are her motivation to keep working hard.  Her plan now is to expand her business and open a restaurant in her home since Jes\u00fas knows how to cook, and she thinks it is a good area for this type of business.  This will be her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She hopes that through it, she will be able to continue with her goals.  She promises to make all of her payments on time like she has with her previous loans.  In this way, she will have access to more loans in the future.

He lives with Elsa and their children, whom he loves very much, in their own home.  They are his motivation.  Benito sells various fruits, which he buys in the capital.  Sometimes a supplier sends them to him.  He takes them to sell to towns and settlements located on the edges of the city.  For this, he has a tricycle equipped with an amplifier.  He has done this work for more than 6 months and has the help of Elsa, who sells from their home.  In this way, they are able to sell all of their products and have better turnover of their inventory.\r\n\r\nHe likes his work because it keeps him busy.  He decided to do it because he needed a business that would let him have an economic income to pay for his home's expenses and his children's education and that would let him manage his own work schedule.  On the other hand, it bothers him when he doesn't sell enough to cover his home's expenses, which happens sometimes due to the constant rains.  But this doesn't discourage him, and he keeps working.  He has plans to continue with his business.  This will be his second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He hopes that through it, he can continue with his goals.  He promises to make his payments on time like he did with his previous loan.

He is also happy and friendly. He is single, doesn't have any children and lives comfortably with his parents and his three siblings: Deysi, 29; Yen, 22; and Aron, 19. Kenny makes a living transporting passengers with an automobile he purchased with his savings when a low-cost opportunity presented itself two years ago. He gets up very early in search of customers on the city streets, works until he takes a mid-day break, and then dedicates himself to technical school in the afternoon. He considers his work lucrative because of the good profits he makes. He enjoys the activity because he can manage his free time and focus on his studies. He says that he decided on this work out of the need to earn income because he had a lot of needs that he couldn't afford. Now he feels more calm and comfortable because he has steady income and more free time. However, he tells us that it bothers him a bit when it rains a lot because it makes it difficult to work, but it doesn't discourage him. He plans to finish his higher education and start his own transportation company. This will be his second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he hopes your collaboration will help solidify his plans.

He wants to use his loan money to purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can serve his customers faster. He also wishes to use the money to increase his working capital. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called champion agents. Bright is one of the champion agents. This is his story. \r\n\r\nWhen Bright first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 48 transactions a day. Because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time.

She is separated from the father of her 2 daughters, Diana (aged 14) and Nayeli (aged 8). Jauna lives in her own house with her children whom she loves very much; they are her stimulus for continuing ahead. Juana's activity is selling groceries of primary necessity, which she buys in the city's commercial centers and sells by order from her own house. She doesn't have a store but, rather, sells her products to neighbors on credit, collecting daily.\r\n\r\nJuana has had this business for over 3 years, during which she has tended her customers in a kind and cordial manner, earning their loyalty. She considers her earnings sufficient to allow her to sell on credit, but to do so, she has to raise prices considerably.\r\n\r\nJuana likes her business since it allows her to be at home to attend to her daughters, plus it offers a job, keeps her occupied and generates income to help cover household expenses and the education of her daughters. Consequently, seeing the good results from her business, she plans to continue, making it grow, acquiring more merchandise to re-stock, and offering more variety.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's 4th loan through MFP.

He works as a for-hire driver of a municipal shuttle taxi.  His monthly income is enough only to cover the family's expenses, and this is why he has an additional income from fattening up and selling livestock.

years old, married and raising two children, the youngest of whom is ten months old.  At the beginning of 2010, Damira and her husband bought a house in the Belovodskoe village and, in search of an income source for their family, started their own business in animal husbandry.  Having invested an initial capital of 20,000 som (KGS), Damira was able to grow her business to have a monthly profit of 6,000 som (KGS).  At the present time, her business contains two bulls and, to increase livestock headcount by buying dairy cows, Damira requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued expansion of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1064081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Belovodskoe village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50065.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095499},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50065.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754607}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T15:46:21Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":407516,"name":"Kosar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kosar has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her son\u2019s fruit sales business.

In 2010, while looking for a source of additional income for her family, she launched her own business selling spare parts at the market. Thanks to Uruila's persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business so that it now makes 20,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, the assortment of goods in the shop is not very wide, and for this reason Uruila has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 51,000 som (KGS).

Vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo e hijo, instalados c\u00f3modamente en su propia casa. La actividad que realiza Luz es la costura, oficio que aprendi\u00f3 estudiando en un centro de educaci\u00f3n ocupacional en otra ciudad, para luego comprar una maquina de coser con sus ahorros, y desde entonces instal\u00f3 en su propia casa un taller donde atender a sus clientes, quienes la buscan por sus buenos acabados, logrando ganarse  su aceptaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed la recomiendan con otras personas que luego se vuelven en sus clientes habituales.  Se inicio hace m\u00e1s de 4 meses en \u00e9ste negocio, realiz\u00e1ndolo ella sola.\nConsidera rentable su actividad por las ganancias que le deja que son mayores a su anterior negocio de venta de verduras. Le gusta la costura por el oficio y ocupaci\u00f3n que le brinda, que le vali\u00f3 para apoyar a su pareja a solventar los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo, quienes son su mayor motivaci\u00f3n para progresar.

Por tanto tiene  planes de ampliar su negocio y comprarse otras maquinas de coser para poder tener un mejor acabo en su costura. Este ser\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 3 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP, se siente agradecida con la ayuda financiera que viene recibiendo y desea continuar con este apoyo, por tanto se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores.

She\u2019s married to Gilder who is a laborer and the father of her only son, Alex, 11, who she wants to provide a better quality of life for.  She lives with her husband and son comfortably in their own house.  \r\n\r\nLuz\u2019s activity is sewing, an occupation she learned taking courses at an occupational education center in another city to then buy a sewing machine with her savings and since then has had a workshop at home where she takes care of customers who seek her out because of her good finishing touches thereby earning their acceptance; they recommend her to other persons who then become regular customers.  She started the business more than four months ago and she works by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers her activity to be profitable because the profits she earns are greater than in her previous business which was selling vegetables.  She likes sewing as an occupation because of the work it generates that helped her support her spouse with household expenses and with her son\u2019s education costs; they are her greatest motivation to make progress.  But she also comments that it is a bit uncomfortable due to the physical fatigue  caused by sitting in the same position which causes backaches.  However, this doesn\u2019t discourage her and she continues working and putting in her best effort.  She plans to expand the business buying more sewing machines so that her work can have better finishing touches.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan #3 from MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial help she\u2019s been getting and wants to continue with this support so she commits to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  She comments, too, that she\u2019s comfortable with her communal bank group because she knows most of them and considers them to be good people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1800 new soles to buy a sewing machine that attaches clasps and buttons and has a value of 250 new soles and will use the remainder to buy sewing supplies like fabric, thread and the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1044135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He therefore commits to be responsible with his installment payments like he\u2019s been in previous loans.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1500 new soles to buy the ingredients needed to prepare his snacks like flour, shortening, butter, oil and others looking for the best prices available for paying cash so that he can have stock on hand to prepare his products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1044178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, shortening, butter and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":132.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":143.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":148.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":155.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.65,"local_amount":194.74,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":199.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714132},{"amount":40.61,"local_amount":105.94,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098702},{"amount":89.02,"local_amount":232.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":237.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401552},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":121.71,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":124.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451510},{"amount":99.63,"local_amount":259.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":265.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446690},{"amount":53.01,"local_amount":138.28,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":141.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187775},{"amount":54.9,"local_amount":143.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571842},{"amount":116.53,"local_amount":304,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121633}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T14:59:49Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":407571,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip is 24 years old and single.

She works hard to provide a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nFor long years Rosario worked buying and selling regional products in the various settlements in the region.  While she did that she suffered much because she had to be away from her children for long periods of time; she was unable to watch them grow up as she would have liked.  Because of that, once her seven children became independent she decided to change her workplace and start selling products at home to enjoy watching her youngest child grow up as well as to have more peace of mind and to be able to spend more time alongside her family.\r\n\r\nDuring these last two years that she\u2019s been working at home she\u2019s enjoyed every minute alongside her family and this is something she values highly.

Hace un tiempo tuvo que cerrar una tienda que ten\u00eda por problemas de salud y gracias a la colaboraci\u00f3n que le brindaron sus hijos pudo superar sus quebrantes de salud. Hace poco tiempo volvi\u00f3 a abrir su tienda, pero ha presentado la dificultad de que el ser nuevo en el sector no es muy conocido por sus clientes, adem\u00e1s de que no cuenta con una puerta o ventana con la que se pueda hacer m\u00e1s visible para sus clientes, dificultad que ha venido superando ofreciendo una buena atenci\u00f3n. Otra dificultad que presenta es el poco capital con el que contaba en el momento de volver a abrir su tienda, por lo que a menudo no puede responder a los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes, por la poca variedad de productos que ha podido surtir en su tienda. Con el \u00e1nimo de superar estas adversidades, Gerardo busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a realizar una reforma locativa en su negocio para hacer una venta que le permita estar m\u00e1s visible para los clientes, y a comprar productos de la canasta familiar para ofrecer en su tienda.\n\nGerardo espera superar estas adversidades y continuar progresando en su vida, de modo que pueda tener una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y una mejor calidad de vida para \u00e9l y para su familia. \n","en":"Gerardo has had to deal with great difficulties throughout his life, but his determination to get ahead has always allowed him to overcome them and continue progressing with his family.  When he was very young he started selling snacks and generated enough income to support himself so as not to be an economic burden on his parents who always had economic difficulties.  Some time ago he had to close the store due to health issues, and thanks to his children's collaboration he was able to get his health back.  Recently he re-opened the store, but because he is new in the sector he is not well known by his customers, nor does he have a door or window which would make his business more visible to customers.  To compensate he offers good customer service.  Another difficulty he had was the lack of capital at the time he opened the store, which now means he cannot fill customer orders frequently because of a lack of product variety in the stock he keeps.  In order to overcome these adversities, Gerardo is requesting a loan to renovate his store and display his products, and also buy essential groceries for the family shopping basket.\r\n\r\nGerardo hopes to overcome these challenges and continue getting ahead so he can attain economic stability and a better lifestyle for himself and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1044440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

They live with her in-laws, and she and her husband share the responsibility of educating and feeding the children.  She works hard to provide a better lifestyle for her family.  Jeannette sells shoes for a living.  She places orders in other cities and has the goods delivered.  She visits her neighbors, friends and relatives to sell the quality, long-lasting shoes she sells in different styles and comfort levels.  She enjoys her work because she can spend time with her children who are still young and need her care.  Her sales volume is high because her customers are loyal due to her good service.  She has a good income that allows her to contribute to the household economy.  In the future she would like to expand her business and own a successful shop where she could attend to customers more comfortably.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through MFP and she is counting on your support to help her meet her goals.

She and her life partner have six children, ages 24, 23, 20, 18, 15, and 8.  They still live with her even though only the four minors are dependent upon her for food and education.  She has her own house where she lives with her six children and her life partner.\r\n\r\nShe works a lot in order to give her family a better quality of life.  Lucila sells food.  In the afternoons she goes out to the sidewalk to her house where her children help her set up a large table, the grill, the roaster, and the benches.  Then she stokes the charcoal fire and starts with the work of selling the most delicious and flavorful dishes like \u201cjuanes\u201d (a traditional chicken and rice meal) and \u201ctacacho\u201d (a Peruvian dish of fried plantain mashed with pork rind), etc.\r\n\r\nDue to the good seasoning of her food she has a lot of loyal customers because she always gives them a little bit larger portion.  She has been working for a year and a half.  She is happy that it is going well for her, and she can therefore generate income for her household.  The thing she likes about her work is that in the morning she is able to use her time for other activities, which are also fundamental to her income.\r\n\r\nShe has customers every day because she is located in an area that is very accessible to the public.  This allows her to increase her daily income and to provide her family with better living conditions.  In the future she hopes to strengthen the restaurant that she set up with the previous loan.  It is in the process of expanding.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your contribution in order to continue with her objectives.  She pledges once again to make her payments as she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank and to be able to shape a group where all of the people are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy ingredients, supplies, and utensils in order to continue her work.

","en":"Muzaffar is married and raising five children.  He has been involved in buying and selling livestock for over ten years.  He gained the experience of caring for livestock since childhood.  His family is very hardworking, and they all work together well.  Muzaffar is requesting a loan for the first time, hoping to increase his livestock headcount and expand the business.

Safura has more than six years of experience in this field, thanks to her father who taught her the best ways to look after cattle. <p>\r\n\r\nSafura usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in 5-6 months, and then re-sells them for profits at the local livestock bazaar.

Luz Dary trabaja como empleada dom\u00e9stica y con esto aporta econ\u00f3micamente en su hogar para el sostenimiento de sus hijos, sin embargo, los ingresos que genera no son suficientes en algunos momentos para cubrir todos los gastos que se generan en su hogar. Hace un tiempo Luz Dary cultivaba en un terreno que tiene detr\u00e1s de su casa algunas verduras, sin embargo, por los fuertes inviernos de la \u00e9poca y el poco capital con el que contaba para poder sostener sus cultivos se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de cerrarlo y dejarlo a un lado por un tiempo. Actualmente, Luz Dary espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de semilas, riegos y abonos para poder reiniciar su cultivo de verduras y as\u00ed generar ingresos adicionales para su familia.\n\nLuz Dary espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues ya tiene experiencia en la actividad de cultivar verduras y con esto podr\u00e1 suplir mayores necesidades que ahora.

However, income generated is insufficient at present to cover all her household expenses.  \r\n\r\nSome time ago, Luz Dary used to farm vegetables on a parcel of land behind her house.  However, due to the strong winters in the season and the little available capital she had to maintain her crops she had to close it and leave it aside for a time.  Now, Luz Dary hopes that the loan will make it possible for her to buy seeds, irrigation and manure to restart her vegetable farming thus generating additional income for her family.\r\n\r\nLuz Dary hopes that this way her income will increase considerably because she already has vegetable farming experience and she could cover more needs this way.  Also, Luz Dary hopes that with higher income her daughter can access a higher quality education and better economic opportunities that will allow them to make progress more easily.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1045501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":49850},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":51252},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":52694},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":54176},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55700},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57267},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":58878},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60534},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":62237},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":63987},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":65787},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":67638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.69,"local_amount":50209,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50524.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902578},{"amount":29.46,"local_amount":51559,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51883.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326928},{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":52436,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52765.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432317},{"amount":62.56,"local_amount":109468,"processed_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":110156.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432981},{"amount":32.27,"local_amount":56465,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":56819.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640376},{"amount":68.69,"local_amount":120214,"processed_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":120969.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029451},{"amount":72.13,"local_amount":126224,"processed_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548111},{"amount":37.07,"local_amount":64872,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":65279.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517359},{"amount":39.17,"local_amount":68553,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68983.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552536}],"funded_date":"2012-04-06T09:40:46Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":407948,"name":"Sakina Begum's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina begum is a 40 year-old married woman.

Being a responsible and very active person in life, Anzirat worked as a foreman of a farming business and was elected as the leader of the village elders court in the Markaz village several years ago.  In 1996, in search of a source of income for her family, she started her own farming business - growing onions, with an initial amount of  10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anzirat's persistence and hard work, she was able to grow her business to have a seasonal income of 50,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Anzirat requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy onion seeds and fuel. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1064828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been doing this business for the past eight years. She does this business on her own and she always provides a good product. What she likes the best about her work is that she doesn\u2019t have set hours. She is able to spend time with her father and her child. Her customers like this crisp product. This is why she searches for the best of the best ingredients, so that her customers are happy. Her business is going well even though prices have been going up because it is not the yucca season. This is temporary and the prices will go down. In the future she hopes to expand her business by bringing regional products to sell at the wholesale market. This is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy with them as they provide her with financial backing. In this way she can increase her working capital. She knows that she needs to be very responsible and more importantly, very punctual. She is happy to be part of the community bank as they are very united.

Maria is a single mother and the head of a family with two children, since the father of her children died some time ago and left her a widow and in charge of the household. Since then, Maria has been working hard as a domestic employee, and thanks to this she generates income with which she can support the household expenses. Nevertheless, many times the income that she generates is not sufficient to cover all the household expenses, and for this reason she wants to look for a way to generate additional income for her family. At a very early age, Maria learned how to raise chickens, since she lived for a long time on a farm, and there she acquired a lot of experience. With the intention of resuming this activity, Maria is seeking a loan that will offer her the possibility of constructing a shed to use as a chicken coop, purchasing chickens and caring for them, and thus resuming this activity with which she will be able to generate extra income in her home.\r\n\r\nMaria hopes that in this way her monthly income will continue growing considerably and, in addition, she will be able to create a better quality of life for her two children. Maria dreams of being able to have a big business and that this will allow her to become completely independent and not have to continue working as a domestic employee, since she is very poorly paid.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1045542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Through a lot of effort he was able to buy his own house and there he raised and educated his kids. Now he is separated and lives in a rented home and has since been working in different sawmills in the city in search of wood that he purchases. Later he takes it to his workshop where he forms and molds it to sell to various carpenters who make furniture. He has been doing his work for more than 20 years and has always worked alone because he feels more comfortable that way. He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have an income and manage his own time, as well as being something that he's enjoyed doing since he was very young. He wants to have his workshop and make the furniture himself, but for the moment he's happy because little by little it will come and he expects to achieve that. \r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP, which makes him very happy because he always wished that some institution would give him the opportunity to be able to grow by investing in his business.

At the age of 15 he decided to learn the job of raising chickens.  Three years later he began to grow vegetables such as pipi\u00e1n squash, and he currently wants to set up a \"pupusa\" [stuffed tortillas] business.\r\n\r\nHe buys all the products he needs in a city in the eastern part of the country because where he lives there is not a specialized store.

","en":"Abdusaid is a 42-year-old man who lives in the very last village of the jamoat of Utkansoi, very close to the mountains (a \"jamoat\" is an administrative division in Tajikistan).  \r\nHe grows and sells peanuts, and also fattens up and sells livestock.

She lives with Arturo, who is 30, and with whom she has three children: Antonio aged 7 and Isis and Alondra both aged 1. She lives in her own house and works hard to offer her family a better quality of life. For many years, Damaris solely depended on the income her partner brought into the home, until a given moment when she began to need to improve their quality of life. It is because of this she decided to work, and which at the same time, allowed her to be at her children\u2019s side and not neglect the home. It is how she embarked on her project selling footwear. For two years she has been offering her customers different styles of very good quality and modern shoes, sandals and trainers. As all good women that wish to progress, she has many plans for her life, amongst them are giving her children a good education and being able to have a prosperous business that is profitable, but she knows that she still has a long way to go and for the moment she just wants to consolidate herself more in what she is doing, and later expand her business with other products. This will be her third loan with MPF, she is very happy knowing that she will have financial support, since she will feel secure in advancing with her work. On the other hand, she promises to continue being a punctual client and paying her repayments as they are scheduled.

Ella poco a poco ha ido surtiendo la papeler\u00eda, sin embargo todav\u00eda le falta una variedad m\u00e1s amplia de productos para competir con otras papeler\u00edas m\u00e1s establecidas que hay por la colonia. Ella espera que con la ayuda de este cr\u00e9dito finalmente pueda surtir su papeler\u00eda con los productos que le faltan para as\u00ed poder empezar a establecerse como una de las papeler\u00edas l\u00edderes de la colonia. Ella espera en los siguientes a\u00f1os poder seguir creciendo con su negocio y alg\u00fan d\u00eda poder ampliar el espacio donde tiene su papeler\u00eda.\n","en":"Las Posesionarias are a support group in the town of Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n.  This group is made up of 11 people who have distinguished themselves for being a group that makes its payments on time and they say the key is being a very close group with a lot of communication.\n\nSandra is one of the women in the group. She is 35 years old and lives with her husband. They have 2 children, a 12 year old boy and a 7 year old girl. They are in middle and primary school. Seven months ago, Sandra decided to open a small paper store in her home. She has stocked it little by little, but she still needs a wider variety of products to compete with the more established paper stores in the neighborhood. She hopes that with the help of this loan, she will finally be able to stock her store with the products she is lacking to be able to establish herself as one of the leading paper stores in the neighborhood. She hopes that in the next few years she can keep growing with her business and someday enlarge the space where she has her paper store.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6275,"image":{"id":1045880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to finish stocking her paper store and enlarge it more.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.
