In search of a source of income for her family, Nurgul became involved in animal husbandry in 2002, having started this business with an initial amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Today, her business contains a dairy cow, two calves and one horse. The earnings from sale of milk and meat products amount to about 5,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.

They have 5 children, for whom they worked very hard over the years. All are now grown and independent. At present, Zoila and her husband work together with the goal of saving money for a tranquil old age. Every morning Zoila does her household chores, then heads for her farm where she has 2 sheds for raising chickens. She has around 2,500 baby chicks who need the required care to make them grow sufficiently to be sold in the city's chicken market.\r\n\r\nZoila has done this type of work in the past but this is her 1st time on such a large scale. During her 15 years in this business she learned to provide her birds with good care so that they can go to market at the ideal weight. She enjoys her work because it generates income for her home without having to depend on other people, and because she can work alongside her husband.\r\n\r\nNow the time is approaching for her customers to buy large chickens and she needs the capital to buy chicken feed and some equipment to continue raising chickens. This will be her 5th loan through MFP. Zoila is very content to know that she will have financing, enabling her to feel secure in advancing her business. On her part, she promises to make payments punctually, as with past loans. In addition, she is very content to belong to her communal bank, because everyone is responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 2,500 new sols, Zoila will purchase chicken feed and some equipment to provide drinking water and mechanized delivery of water to the dispensers; then she just needs to regulate feeding to be able to begin selling chickens.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1048829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed for her chickens and water dispensers plus mechanized equipment to deliver drinking water to the dispensers.

Each day Rafael goes out very early to the different streets around the city to look for his eventual passengers who are seeking travel for themselves and their cargo around the city, or at times to the outskirts.\r\n\r\nAside from this work, he also works sometimes as a mason, specializing in floors and columns in the various jobs in the city.  How he offers his services depends on how the labor market is.  He has been doing this kind of work for 15 years and he learned everything he knows about construction from his father, whose advice he appreciates.  He likes his work because it provides him with good earnings, even though it\u2019s very exhausting because he has to be in the sun and sometimes in the rain, but he does the best he can.  If he can see his family happy, then he is capable of all that and much more.

She works as a teacher at a local school. While looking for a source of additional income for her family, in 2005 Nazira launched her own livestock business with an initial sum of 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazira's persistent and dedicated work, her herd currently has 3 dairy cows and 6 sheep, and earns her roughly 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her business, Nazira has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and resale. She plans to invest a portion of her profits from this loan into repairing her home, and later - into further expanding her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1065353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chon - Jar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":32523.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095509},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":32523.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754617},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":32523.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013767},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32523.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467830675}],"funded_date":"2012-04-26T00:31:09Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T10:22:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":408739,"name":"Kubra's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kubra has requested a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband, who operates a hair and body oil sales business.

She lives in her own home next to her husband and works a lot to be able to have a better quality of life.  Lucy's work consists of selling sheets; every so often she goes to the city of Iquitos where she buys imported sets of sheets, and upon her return she must sell them on layaway or in full to the many customers she serves.  During these last 15 years of work, she has learned a lot, most of which is to know how to treat customers well and to find a manageable price to pay per month for her clients so that they will always be happy.  She enjoys what she does, as it allows her to have free time since she makes her own schedule, except on rare occasions when her customers tell her the exact time that they need a particular item.  When this occurs, she always shows up 15 minutes earlier than the agreed upon time because she is so responsible.  Although she has a very good clientele and is very happy to work with them, she desires to do new things to try to increase her clientele, which she will be able to achieve with a larger investment, having a greater variety of products to offer.

Luisa is a woman who has been selling clothes for a long time.  She relates that at the beginning she sold door to door and sometimes took advantage of the street markets in nearby towns until she managed to save up capital to build her house which is where she now sells her garments much more comfortably.  She usually works with help from her beloved husband who to this day continues selling in some of the street markets while Luisa is in charge of buying stock merchandise in the capital.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with the business because thanks to it she was able to reach many of her dreams but she still has much more to accomplish.

His children are 18 year old Noor and 16 year old Boris, and they are his motivation for getting ahead.  They live in their own home, an estate that they were able to purchase after many years of saving.  Orlando's work consists of transporting passengers and freight into and out of the city, leaving very early in the morning from his house and going to the the closest market where he waits for passengers to take his motorcycle taxi.  He then is in charge of carrying them safe and sound to their destinations.  During the entire time that he has been carrying out this job, (18 years), he has learned many things and has several shortcuts and also areas in which he knows that prices have to be a bit higher.  His work is going very well due to the fact that he already knows how to carry out his job in the best way, as well as permitting him to have time to take his children to and from school.  He is very content, as on some occasions he has clients that contract him for hours at a time and which allows him to work less and to reduce the wear and tear on his motor.  Now he is waiting to improve the condition of his motorcycle taxi and to buy himself another one to rent out and gain an additional profit.  This will be his second loan with MFP, and therefore awaits your collaboration to continue with his goals.  He is also committed again to make his payments as in the other loans he has received.  He is very happy to be a part of his community bank since everyone is very united and responsible.  With the requested amount of 1000 soles, he will purchase replacement parts and will order repairs for a few parts that are deteriorating through time, as well as to purchase insurance to to be able to guarantee the passengers he carries to their destinations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1048785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase replacement parts and to repair his motorcycle taxi, and to be able to update his transportation insurance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":111.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":140.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.47,"local_amount":230.59,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":230.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714153},{"amount":41.9,"local_amount":111.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":111.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203051},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":123.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":123.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098724},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":127.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":128.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401574},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":128.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455871},{"amount":51.52,"local_amount":137.37,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":137.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451522},{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446702}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:10:58Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Young","image":null}},{"id":405873,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 39 a\u00f1os de edad  casado con Jes\u00fas de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen 3 hijos, ellos viven en el distrito de Llochegua.

Since that moment Rayda had to experience many unexpected events working as a farmworker where they paid her a pittance.

She is married to Jose, who is employed, and they have 2 beautiful children: Rosa, aged 18, and Renzo, aged 7, whom they love a lot.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Deyba has a business selling groceries.  She sells from a store that is set up in her own house.  This is where she tends to her customers, who are mainly her neighbors.  She started this business more than 2 years ago because she needed to have additional income.  She took some small capital that she had saved up, and together with a loan, she managed to buy some small quantities of merchandise.  In this way she attracted customers.  She thinks that her business is profitable because of the good earnings it gives her, and because it has been well-received by her customers.  She enjoys the business because it allows her to stay in her house and also enjoy the tranquility of having an income.  In addition, she can use her free time to care for her house.  However, she doesn't like it when her customers request to make their purchases on credit, because she has had some bad experiences with these types of sales when people fail to make their payments.  For this reason she no longer sells on credit, making all of her sales on a cash basis.  But as she is seeing good results, she has plans to continue to grow and expand her business.  This will be her 2nd loan with MFP, and she feels grateful for the financial support to implement her plans.  Also, she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she knows the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  \r\n\r\nWith the sum of 1,000 Peruvian soles she requests, she will invest in the purchase of groceries at wholesale, looking for the lowest prices so that she can obtain the highest profits.  She thinks that with a larger quantity and variety of products, her business will continue to be popular and her earnings will increase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1050493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy consumer staples to stock her business\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deyba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":151.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":165.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":185.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":151.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":151.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714161},{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":150.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203060},{"amount":61.97,"local_amount":165.27,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":165.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098732},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":172.21,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":172.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401583},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":175.54,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455879},{"amount":69.74,"local_amount":185.98,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":186.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451528}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:35:25Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":408883,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is 36 years old and married with 3 children.

She has 3 children, but she lives with only one of them, Lisbeth, in her own house, located in the town of Paccha. She mainly grows potatoes, corn and also alfalfa to feed her animals. She has cows, calves and sheep, which with the help of her daughter she takes to graze in the countryside when her alfalfa production is low. This happens generally in the summer season, when it is not produced in sufficient quantities, and what she is able to harvest she sells at the provincial market in her town. She also sells her animals from time to time, such as sheep, cows and bulls, when an opportunity for a sale presents itself. Generally, the buyers come to her home. She thinks it is good to work in these two parallel activities to maintain stability in her income and gradually expand her business. However, since she is very hard-working, she also works packaging chicken meat in a company. She reports that she does this 2 or 3 times a week, since she has to take care of her animals and crops. Now she has set concrete goals to continue to expand her business, and she is sure that she will achieve them. She found out about MFP through a neighbor in her community who invited her to join the communal bank, where she is now a member for the second cycle. Throughout this time she has demonstrated responsibility with her payments, and she has won confidence for being a person who can be vouched for, so she can continue having access to loans, which are her opportunity for growth. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving her support, Olga will invest the funds she is requesting in buying medicines in bulk to prepare by type and dosage for her animals, and if she still has sufficient funds, she will also be able to buy alfalfa for them. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1053211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy medicines for her animals and alfalfa.

She lives with her two children, Deysi and Yareli, whom she is raising in her own house, located in the town of Paccha. Her principal work is raising animals and she does so with great dedication. She owns various heads of sheep, which she keeps on a ranch since they are banned from her house because of the space they would occupy. Consequently she constantly visits them since they are cared for by shepherds whom she pays monthly.\r\n\r\nAs well she engages in farming, but only during the planting season. For example she has beans and potatoes that she will harvest shortly. She is certain she will earn a good income since her fields are healthy and growing without any difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn addition, at nights she takes care of the small hospital in her village, where they pay her a monthly salary. She has always been characterized as a very resourceful woman, since in the afternoons she also cooks in the cafeteria. In this way she is able to support her children and move them ahead on her own. \r\n\r\nNancy learned about MFP from a neighbor in her community who invited her to be part of the communal bank. This will be her first loan and she will prove that she is responsible in making her payments and has earned confidence as a trustworthy person so that she can continue applying for loans, which are her opportunity for growth. Upon receiving your support Nancy will invest the money in the purchase of medicine to provide her animals the vitamins and minerals that insure healthy growth and development.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1053206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy vitamins and calcium for her animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-07T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-07T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":534.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446715}],"funded_date":"2012-04-09T15:29:50Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":407726,"name":"Washinton Sigifredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Washinton  de 52 a\u00f1os vive ( duran ecuador ).

They also have grazing grounds for their cattle in various plots of arable land that Emerita and her husband inherited. Agriculture is an activity she very much enjoys and likes doing because she is always in contact with earth and nature, which she finds very calming. But since she is a hardworking woman, every morning she takes her bulls, cows and sheep out to graze. She tells us that she wants to churn cheese but does not yet own enough dairy cows. What she does use her bulls for is to till her own land: as she says, \"this way I do not have to pay someone to prepare the soil\". Very soon, she will buy more sheep, with the help of her husband who works in a mine. She belongs to the communal bank \"productores agr\u00edcolas\" (agriculture producers) and this is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is one of the oldest members of her bank, and feels very proud of the fact, because she has had the chance to make her business grow consistently thanks to the loans she received.

He has 4 automobiles that he rents to drivers for a considerable sum of money per day.  This has allowed him to have a stable income.  However, he is concerned about the care of his vehicles, because he says that many times the irresponsible drivers crash the cars and are not liable for it. \"In this type of situation, it is I who has to pay for the expenses,\" he says.  The route that he works runs from the central plaza to the office of public records.  His wife monitors the arrival of the cars that they have in their fleet, and in this way they make a good team for their business.  However, since he has a license to drive trucks, he works as a driver transporting heavy cargo throughout the country.  He says that soon he will travel to Moya to transport wheat, where they pay him very well, as the transportation of food products requires a lot of responsibility.

She has been doing this work for 8 years, and now everyone knows her and knows her to be a very intelligent woman who is always seeking new ways to sell her food.

Now she wants to add a small eatery to her business.  She doesn't need much, because she already started buying some of the things she needs, such as plates, spoons and other items.

She is also grateful because she is managing to offer her children a better quality of living and an adequate education. On the other hand, the daily walking she does to do her collections makes her physically tired because of the remoteness of the areas where she sells her product. Moreover, due to these drawbacks, she has plans to open a small grocery store in a stall in the city market. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP institution. She is very happy to know that she will have a loan, as this way she will sure of supporting herself through her business. Therefore she promises to make her installment payments, as with the previous loans.

When he returns, he has to transport the supplies on his back to his house. Santos is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy five sacks of fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, and to pay $100 to rent the land where he will grow corn and beans.\r\n\r\nThis way he will be able to grow his main crop, and this will help him so that he doesn't lack what he needs to support his family. He wishes to buy a bicyce because the one he has doesn't work anymore; it is what he uses as a means of transport for going from his house to his place of work, as this takes him 30 minutes.

In addition, she is very decisive and cheerful.  She lives with Hidelbrando who is employed, but they have no children since that is not part of their plans.  Most of all, they want to succeed personally.  Both of them live in a house owned by her sister.  Gleydys has an agricultural business, primarily growing cassava since this area is suitable for this product.  She has a plot of land containing 17 hectares owned by her father, who leased the property to her without cost so that she could farm.  Gleydys is looking for new and better opportunities in life.  She currently has two hectares that are producing cassava that she will take to the markets in the city to sell.  Gleydys also sells in other cities since there is suitable demand.  She  started farming more than five years ago.  In order to maintain the land and harvest the crops, she has the help of two other workers who are hired as needed and paid a salary of 20 PEN each day.  \r\n<p>\r\nGleydys considers her business to be profitable since there is demand and her earnings have been good.  The price of her product has increased due to shortages.  She enjoys this business because she has more income compared to the lower salary earned from her previous job.  Gleydys also lives comfortably.  She learned how to work in the fields from her parents.  Since she has achieved good results, she has plans to continue her business and maintain it.  This will be her third loan with the MFP organization and she is pleased to have access to credit.  In order to continue her business, Gleydys wants to keep receiving this support.  She promises to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  The amount of 1000 PEN that she requested will be invested in planting cassava on the additional tracts of land (less the existing two hectares that have already been planted).  In order to this, she plans to hire workers.  Her goal is to increase production since there is demand for this product.  Since the prices tend to stay high, Gleydys will be able to earn more income.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1049288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gleydys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":184.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119.75,"local_amount":319.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":319.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714158},{"amount":62.19,"local_amount":165.83,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203057},{"amount":131.57,"local_amount":350.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":351.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401580},{"amount":61.49,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":164.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455877}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T00:40:26Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":409893,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 44-year-old married woman with children, living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Cristian is a young man who has always been very enterprising, and he puts a lot of care into his work, which has allowed him to attract a large clientele, who seek out his work.  Cristian offers a service that is not very readily found in his town; there are few similar businesses, which means he gets a good part of the work in his town and that he makes very good sales.
