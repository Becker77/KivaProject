The bread that she makes she sells at home and her husband sells it from a bicycle in the neighborhood where they live and in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nElsi buys the supplies to make the bread from distributors, who carry the supplies to her home since they lack the necessary resources to transport them. When they run out of supplies she calls and places her order by credit, and then she pays for it at the end of the week. \r\n\r\nElsi is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, in order to buy 50 cartons of eggs, 25 quintals of flour, 25 quintals of sugar, 30 pounds of butter, 20 pounds of salt, a cartload of wood, and to make improvements to the stove which is damaged.\r\n\r\nWith the investment she can make different types of bread, she will be able to sell more and her income will increase and in this way she can satisfy the neighborhood demand. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to buy an industrial electric stove to bake more bread, because in the winter she can only bake once a day because of the rain.

This is thanks to how well-received her business is with her customers.\r\n\r\nShe likes to cook, and she learned the secrets of good seasoning from her mother.  Her income allows her to pay her bills and her household expenses.  She does now like being physically tired.  She has to get up very early in the morning to make the daily preparations.  However, this does not discourage her, and she continues with her business.  She wishes to expand her business and to improve her roof, where she will be able to tend to her customers more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your collaboration in order to be able to firm up her plans.  Also, she says that she is comfortable with her communal bank, and she considers the members to be responsible people.

She is one of those ladies who started working as soon as she had completed her education. As a matter of fact, she had been working while studying on order to contribute to her family\u2019s budget. Since she had devoted all her life to working, she had postponed the idea of marriage and only recently became engaged. As an eagerly devoted business woman following her graduation, she started working in the printing shop of her uncle without knowing anything about the business. Due to her eagerness and perseverance within a short time, she mastered the printing business. In time, when her uncle started a new business, he turned over the management and ownership of the printing house to Serap. Naturally she had some financial difficulties in the beginning and she still has, but she overcomes these difficulties with the support of Maya. She developed her business of the printing shop into the organization business, started entering into areas such as wedding invitations, and wedding candies.  Currently she has very good customer connections. She will use the current loan from Maya via Kiva to buy paper and edge cutting machines, and stamps. These machines will help her to decrease her costs by keeping certain jobs in house which she had been previously outsourcing, thus increasing her profit.  She always expresses her gratitude to Maya for their support.\r\n \r\nThe two other members of the group are marketing the products of a cleaning company both from home and from the store (with the support of Serap). They are thankful for the Maya loans, which provide them with working capital that enables them to buy products in bigger wholesale lots. \r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya

She lives with Elmer, who works in transportation, and they have two beautiful children, Deysi, 13 and Flor, 5, whom they love very much. They live comfortably in their own house.\r\n\r\nRosa has a business selling fruit ices from a refrigerator. Once they are ready, she takes them to school where she has a small stand in the cafeteria. From there she cordially serves her customers, who are students and teachers. She started this business over four years ago and during that time she has worked alone.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business very profitable because of the demand for her products due to the hot climate in the area. She likes her business since it enables her to have an income with which she can pay for household expenses and the needs of her small children who motivate her to continue moving forward. She does not like it when it rains very frequently, thereby lowing sales and reducing profits but even then the business still manages to be profitable.

For the past 3 years, Calvin has been working hard to manage her small business, selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Calvin has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and it will help Calvin to generate greater profits and increase her capital. Calvin hopes that in the future she will be able to earn more money to expand her business.\r\n\r\nCalvin is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

He is currently in his second loan cycle, after having correctly repaid his first loan. With the loan that he received, he paid the workers who cultivated his fields and bought inputs, 300 kg of potatoes, as well as 21 kg of chemical fertilizer. The difficulty that he foresees in terms of repaying his loan is climate change.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre's strategy is to expand his farming by buying another field and planting more. Doing so will be possible with other loans in the future. His strategy will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming a major potato farmer in the region. With respect to his family, he plans to pay the school fees for his children once they start going to school.

She is also cheerful and kind.  She lives with Enrique, who is retired and the father of their three children.  It is for the children that they have made such efforts to get ahead.  She lives with her life partner and their children in their own house.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s business is selling food, mostly breakfasts and a set menu.  She has a place set up at her own house where she opened her restaurant.  It is set up with tables, chairs, and the utensils needed to tend to her customers very well.  Seeing that her area is busy, she feels that she has demand.  Due to her life partner\u2019s illness, she saw the financial needs that her household had.  She decided to start in this business over 12 years ago.  In the beginning she worked alone, but now she counts on help from her children.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable.  She says this is because the profit margins are very good, and the regular clientele that she has are to her benefit.  She really likes to cook.  She learned from her mother, who taught her the secrets of good seasoning.  With this she hopes to be able to continue with customer acceptance and being their preference.\r\n\r\nAlso, she has plans to grow, and in the future she plans to expand her restaurant by opening a branch in a commercial zone in the city of Pucallpa.  This way she will manage to get greater income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her tenth loan with MFP.  She hopes for your collaboration in order to continue on with her objectives.

He lives with his mother, Guida, his father, Gregorio, and his two siblings, Melvin and Talia, whom he cares for in his own home, located in the town of Ancalayo.  As the oldest son, he works to help his parents and siblings.  \"My parents are older, and they need my support,\" he states.  To do this, he has for some time now, with the help of Angel, his partner, rented a brick-making workshop where he makes 30,000 bricks a month, selling these on the basis of monthly orders to his regular customers.  He is always offering his customers the best products that he knows how to make.  In addition to this, thanks to his efforts, he has 2 bulls that he feeds with a lot of dedication.  He says that he also cultivates alfalfa, which he uses to feed them.  Thus, he must bear long days of work plowing the land.  Now he wants to start up a business raising cows, because there is a demand for fresh milk.  To do this, he will take the first step by purchasing a quality cow.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he feels happy, because he found the help that he needed so much to realize his plans.  In addition, he is responsible in all of his work, and so he promises to be on time with his payments.  Once Blidmer receives your support, he will invest the money requested in the purchase of a cow, which costs an average of 2,000 Peruvian soles.  He has already saved up a little money, and so with this loan he will gather together enough money to make this purchase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1056902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Jhon is a very kind-hearted man who works as a taxi driver.  His work routine is to get up very early, because he is affiliated with a transportation line where each worker must wait his turn to go out and provide taxi services.  Jhon has been doing this work successfully for 7 years, although he has had to change vehicles twice.  He started out with a second-hand car, and with it he managed to save money and eventually buy a new car.

He tells us that everything is going very well in his work. The only difficulty he has is not having his own transportation, which makes the cost of shipping his products very high. During production seasons he mainly works at gathering up products, while his beloved wife is in charge of working their agricultural land with workers that they hire for the season so that they can have a better harvest. Eusebio is happy with the job he does because it gives him good earnings. At the same time, he is not content with it because he is planning to open a restaurant because he has a house near the place where he wants to open it. This is the fourth loan he has had with Microfinanzas Prisma. He pledges, once more, to make his repayments punctually. He is happy with his communal bank because they [the other members] are good people. With the 2,500 PEN he will do maintenance on his agricultural land.

Filomena has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\n\nIn 2012, Filomena re-joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Filomena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD in 'Upolu, the main island.  This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  Filomena is now requesting a new loan for 1,000 WST, which she will use to purchase a box of chicken, sausage, plastic plates, and foil.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD's branch office in Savai'i, where she now lives.  Filomena plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve and expand the borrower's

They requested a loan of 250,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nAwtar is 28 years old, a married woman with two children. She is the leader of this group. (In the photo she is on the left, with pink fabric on her shoulder.) She lives in Aden, Yemen. She is a merchant; specifically she sells new clothes for adults and children, according to the season. \r\n\r\nAwtar has been doing this for three years. She sells her products from her house. She buys her merchandise from distributors and stores where the prices are cheaper. She began this activity as a result of the lack of a clothes market in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to her neighbors who supported her over all these years. With the income from her business she was able to upgrade her home and enjoy more comfort. At the present time, her business doesn't get her as much profit due to the bad situation in Yemen.\r\n\r\n So she applied for a youth loan of 50,000 YER from AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, etc. She will sell them to her customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve her income from her business. One of her personal dreams is to send her children to  private  high schools.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1056564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Giga\u2019s loan was analyzed in the terms of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program will provide business start-up credits with soft conditions to the rural poor. These borrowers do not have access to standard credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With his own accordion Giga will be able to play at parties, as well as other cultural events held in the district, and earn additional income. The new source of income will allow Giga to improve his living conditions.

The advantage she has is that there are no other businesses nearby and she has little competition.

The challenges Lesbia faces in her business are due to the fact that food staples are more expensive every day and people aren\u2019t buying like they used to.

He has his own livestock and makes an income from his farm's production. He farms roots and tubers and basic grains. He and his family work the farm. Sotero is a man with a good record who makes good on his obligations. He carries himself well and is a hard worker. Sotero is grateful to the institution for this opportunity to improve his family's conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1057402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to improve his pastures.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nueva Guinea, RAAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-04-09T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-09T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sotero","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346991145}],"funded_date":"2012-05-05T22:39:33Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:07:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":410478,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita is 65 years old and married with three children.

So over two years ago she bought her first vehicle and in time has been renovating and buying others.  She likes her business because it allows her to have income to cover family expenses.  But she doesn\u2019t like it when her mototaxi breaks down often because this causes many expenses.  Even so, she manages to get good results.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she plans to grow and to be able to buy more mototaxis to expand her fleet.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEsmeralda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 28,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEsmeralda hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

is Carmelita, 63, a resident of Silang Cavite, Philippines. She is a widow and mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to continuously support her children.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.

She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 23,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Lorena is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorena hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
