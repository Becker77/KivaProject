In addition, it is the only source of his income. On the other hand, through lots of effort, he has managed to grind his customer's grain, i.e., he provides them a service to put food on the table. Recently, he says that the main challenge to his business is a seasonal problem: during the dry season this type of product is very expensive. So, Mohammed took out a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase grain for his business. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to improve his standard of living. In the future, he would like to expand his business to have an extra mill store because his region is lacking some services, which he could supply to solve people's needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1060292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase grains for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-04-10T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-10T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10072},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9992}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.84,"local_amount":10072,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10309.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050594},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072135},{"amount":47.47,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294267006},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320344},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341278},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310634},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918967},{"amount":47.47,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331051230},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339441254},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":9992,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10228.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993936}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T13:04:06Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":410722,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace lives in Yambio.

Allan\u2019s biggest challenge is that the trading booth he is currently at his second outlet is not his. It belongs to a bus service. The owner of the bus service was kind enough to let him use a part of his space for his mobile money transfers. The trouble he says is that, his customers are inconvenienced, as there is no protection against weather elements such as rain or sun. He needs the Kiva loan to be able to buy his own trading booth, which will have a shade and some seats so that his customers can sit as they do the transactions.\r\n\r\nHis appeal to the kiva lenders is that they keep helping small businesses such as his because it goes a long way.\r\n\r\nAllan dreams of opening up more shops in his beloved home town as the demand for his services keeps increasing.

The members work together to sell spaghetti, local juices and peanuts. In order to increase their commercial activity, the group have become members of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are asking for their second loan. Mrs. Maimouna (seen in the photo as woman sitting down all the way to the left) has a strong reputation for selling food pastas in the village and surrounding areas. She plans to use the loan to purchase 10 bags of spaghetti from a bulk market in S\u00e9gou. She re-sells the products both through credit and cash from home to home, at the local markets in her village and the surrounding villages to a customer base mostly comprised of women. She hopes to have a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA [approximately 80 USD] which she will reinvest in her business and take care of the needs of her children.

la llevo a poder comprarse un peque\u00f1o local, el cual lo est\u00e1 dando en alquiler, lo que le ha permitido generar algunos ingresos.\n\nGracias al apoyo que se le est\u00e1 brindando desea poder darle el mantenimiento que necesita a su peque\u00f1o local, ya que convers\u00f3 con el que realiza la renta del local y llegaron al acuerdo de cobrar un poco m\u00e1s de lo usual siempre y cuando se arregle. Daciana desea que con este peque\u00f1o nuevo ingreso pueda comprar ropa y as\u00ed vender por ella misma en el local que alquila, de esta manera cumplir\u00e1 su gran sue\u00f1o, mudarse a un lugar mucho m\u00e1s seguro.\n","en":"Daciana is a woman who after the loss of her husband has struggled much to get ahead by herself.  Her children have been of great moral support for her and she feels a bit less alone in the company of her grandchildren who have become her greatest reason to carry on.\r\n\r\nDaciana would have liked to be a teacher but because she lacked the necessary money she decided to do other jobs which led to her being able to buy a small locale which she is renting out and which produces some income for her.\r\n\r\nThanks to the support she\u2019s getting she\u2019ll be able to give the small locale the maintenance it needs since she talked to her tenant and they agreed that she\u2019d be able to charge a slightly higher than normal rent as long as she fixes up the space.  Daciana hopes that with this new income she will be able to buy clothes to sell herself in the space she currently rents out thus reaching her great dream of moving to a much safer place.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1058247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Fabio se encuentra casado y tiene 6 hijos de quienes manifiesta son su motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar fuertemente en su trabajo todos los d\u00edas. Anteriormente Fabio se desempe\u00f1aba como agricultor, actividad que se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de dejar a un lado dadas las pocas oportunidades que se iban presentando al llegar una gran empresa a su regi\u00f3n que acab\u00f3 con el resto de los cultivos. Fue as\u00ed como aprendi\u00f3 por medio de un familiar a fabricar colchones y posteriormente abri\u00f3 un local en el centro de su municipio donde fabrica los colchones y los vende junto con camas y mesas de noche. En este negocio le ha ido muy bien, pues r\u00e1pidamente lo aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar y se gan\u00f3 el aprecio de sus clientes, sin embargo, hace aproximadamente 2 a\u00f1os tuvo que superar una de las mayores adversidades que se le han presentado en la vida; su f\u00e1brica de colchones se incendi\u00f3 dejando todo el local quemado y ning\u00fan bien material dentro del local pudo ser recuperado, adem\u00e1s, una hija de 5 a\u00f1os muri\u00f3 en esta tragedia. Sin embargo, la fortaleza de Fabio le permiti\u00f3 salir adelante y reiniciar con su f\u00e1brica de colchones, la cual sigue teniendo actualmente y en la cual sigue ofreciendo muy buenos productos a sus clientes. Gracias a sus buenas ventas, Fabio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de materias primas para la fabricaci\u00f3n de los colchones y la compra de camas y mesas para ofrecer a sus clientes.\n\nFabio espera seguir respondiendo a los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes y seguir progresando en su negocio junto a su esposa y sus 6 hijos. Adem\u00e1s, Fabio tiene el sue\u00f1o de tener un local propio para no tener que seguir pagando los altos costos del arriendo que hacen que sus ganancias se reduzcan considerablemente. \n","en":"Fabio is a person who has had to overcome much adversity in his life, which thanks to his love of work and desire to succeed, he has been able to deal with and keep progressing together with his family.\r\n\r\nFabio is married and has six children. He says that his children are his motivation for working hard every day. Previously, Fabio worked as a farmer, a livelihood he was obliged to set aside, given the few opportunities that were presenting themselves, with the arrival in the region of a large company that did away with the rest of the farms. \r\n\r\nSo, through a family member, he learned to make mattresses, and subsequently opened a shop in the center of the municipality, where he makes the mattresses, and sells them together with beds and night tables. Things have gone very well for him in this business, as he learned the work quickly, and earned the appreciation of his customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, approximately two years ago he had to overcome one of the greatest adversities that has arisen in his life. His mattress factory burned down, leaving the entire shop burned, and no good material inside the shop could be recovered. In addition a 5-year-old daughter died in this tragedy. However, Fabio's fortitude allowed him to move forward and restart his mattress factory, which he still has at the present time, and where he continues offering very good products to his customers. \r\n\r\nThanks to his good sales, Fabio is seeking a loan that will offer him the chance to purchase raw materials for making the mattresses, and buying beds and tables to offer to his customers.\r\n\r\nFabio hopes to continue responding to customer orders and keep progressing in his business together with his wife and six children. In addition, Fabio's dream is to have his own shop, and not have to continue paying the high rental costs that reduce his earnings considerably. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1058053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw materials for making mattresses, and to buy beds and tables to offer his customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-10T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-10T18:00:08Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabio De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44602},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45857},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47147},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48473},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49836},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51238},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52679},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54161},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55685},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57251},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58861},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60517},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62219},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63970},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65769},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67619},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69521},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71477},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73487},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75554},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77680},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79865},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82111},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":411208,"name":"Sucett","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sucett is twenty-nine years old and married with four children.

After her years of experience with her aunt, Fatoumata decided to sell cereals: peanuts, \"ni\u00e9b\u00e9\" (cowpeas) , millet, \"fonio\" (a kind of millet), maize, hibiscus flowers, etc. \r\n\r\nAfter having correctly reimbursed her three preceding loans, Fatoumata is on her fourth loan with Soro Yiriwaso.

She started her business 22 years ago needing to find a way to get ahead with her children.  \r\n\r\nShe learned how to make shawls and ponchos from her mother.  Her business is important because she obtains income that helps with her daughter\u2019s school costs and because it keeps her occupied.  \r\n\r\nShe likes everything she does; in the afternoons she tends to her stationery shop.  One day a week she sells flowers and two days a week she makes the shawls.  She likes to make the shawls and ponchos and see them finished.

She has 6 years experience in this work, years in which she has seen benefit for her work. She buys her chickens from chicken farmers passing by, when they are still little, and then she raises them in her home and when they are grown she sells them. She buys her fabric and thread in her municipality, and she takes it home and in her free time she works embroidering napkins with very pretty results, and later when she has finished she offers them to acquaintances. Cecilia used to be immobilized due to a lack of money, but when she stepped up for funding she found a surge to her economy. \u201cThe thing is to not give up and to use your time on something productive, and to know how to invest your money wisely,\u201d says Cecilia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1031204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, feed, corn, fabric and embroidery thread in order to sell items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6739.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7095.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7400.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7765.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":586.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":534.48,"local_amount":6739.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6792.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656802},{"amount":562.73,"local_amount":7095.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7151.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317473},{"amount":586.9,"local_amount":7400.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7458.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418857},{"amount":615.89,"local_amount":7765.54,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7826.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568437}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T08:20:47Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":410363,"name":"Delfines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Abraham tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad el estudio una carrera t\u00e9cnica y dice que ya no continuo con sus estudios por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos, el es parte del grupo Delfines y dice que le pusieron ese nombre porque se sienten libres de trabajar con la financiera aparte de que son unos animales muy inteligentes.

He said he didn't continue with his studies due to the lack of economic resources.  He is part of the \"Delfines\" [Dolphins] group.  He says they named their group that because they feel free to work with financing apart from being very intelligent animals.  He is married to Jessica, who helps him attend to his costume jewelry and gift store.  They have 2 girls.  One is 6 and is in elementary school, and the youngest is 3.  Abraham is requesting a loan to buy bracelets, jewel earrings, rings, necklaces, lingerie, toys, and gifts.  He has rented a location for 6 years very near the center of town.  He says that one of his dreams is to sell silver because it's a good business and is a little more than stationery and gifts.  He says that he goes to Mexico City to buy merchandise since they give him good prices there, and he can earn a little more on the items he sells.  He is very thankful for the loans he has received because his business has grown, and that makes him very happy.  The other 9 members of the group are Elsa, Mar\u00eda Eusebia, Blanca, In\u00e9s, Linda, Susana, Carlota, Angelina, and Mar\u00eda del Carmen.  All of them will invest their loans in their businesses, where they sell women's clothing sales by catalog, sandwiches, housewares, hamburgers, seasonal fruits and vegetables, and lingerie."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6225,"image":{"id":1057426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They will invest in ingredients to make Mexican fast food snacks, in seasonal fruit and vegetables and in plastic dinnerware to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1058276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, insecticide, Calidra and organic manure for her avocado orchard.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2417.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2574.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2686.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2744.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2804.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2864.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2926.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2989.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3054.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3187.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":605.31,"local_amount":7622.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7692.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656806},{"amount":431.34,"local_amount":5431.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5481.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317477},{"amount":450.16,"local_amount":5668.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5720.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418861},{"amount":469.8,"local_amount":5915.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5970.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568440},{"amount":490.29,"local_amount":6173.97,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-17T08:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6230.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399780},{"amount":253.1,"local_amount":3187.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407527}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T23:15:15Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":411430,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is married and has two children.

She has two businesses there.  On the one hand she sells various merchandise via specialized catalogues; she sells perfumes and cosmetics that way.  On the other hand, she also makes fast food in her own neighborhood and adjacent areas.  She started her business 7 years ago to strengthen her home\u2019s wellbeing which up to that time was entirely her spouse\u2019s responsibility. The merchandise in her catalogues she sells directly herself while the fast food is prepared with help from her children Thursdays and Sundays.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy perfume, creams, costume jewelry that are on special discount in her catalogues and for which she has many pending orders; she will also buy in larger amounts the ingredients she needs to make her fast food like cured meats, baked goods, sauces, etc.  Her greatest challenge is insufficient working capital to attain the growth she aspires to and this is precisely the reason why her Kiva loan will be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1059655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

children.  In search of an income for her family, in 2000, Zamira began her business in animal husbandry with 25,000 som (KGS).  Zamira does her work reverently and very seriously.  Thanks to this approach, today Zamira's farm has seven goats and their offspring, four cows, two calves, one horse, and six ponies.  Regardless of the vast amount of labor intensive work, which takes a lot of time, Zamira also farms.  She works 0.5 ha of land where she grows clover, corn, and potatoes.   Her monthly income from the farm comes to about 7,000 som (KGS), a part of which she sets aside for paying her daughter's university tuition.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Zamira applied to Bai Tushym & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) for purchasing mares so she can sell kumis (mare's milk).  Zamira is planning to invest the income in further increasing the number of her livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1065430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T11:00:04Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1287.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":60361.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095511},{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60361.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754619}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T07:36:51Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":410407,"name":"Gabriel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gabriel de 50 a\u00f1os vive (Quevedo Ecuador ).el  trabajaba anteriormente en otra cosa pero como le fue mal y se quedo sin trabajo empez\u00f3 a vender cangil y papitas y le resulto le va bien .  y desde ese entonces se dedica a la venta de papas y canguil.
