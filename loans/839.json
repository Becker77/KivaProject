This will also help her keep her business organized and clean and she\u2019ll be able to offer more variety of products to her customers, which will allow her to continue fighting every day to achieve her biggest dream: to open a supermarket.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1059792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy shelving and merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":70.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":73.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":76.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.29,"local_amount":144.7,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":160.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602119},{"amount":31.76,"local_amount":76.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222301},{"amount":32.95,"local_amount":79.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298371}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T16:52:36Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":410417,"name":"Blanca Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca, habita en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n, due\u00f1a de una pulper\u00eda,  madre de dos hijos de 12 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad respectivamente .Su negocio lo empez\u00f3 hace 5 a\u00f1os cuando solo vend\u00eda bolsas pl\u00e1stica y caramelos su esposo le fue ayudando a comprar m\u00e1s productos para que ofreciera variedad com muy poca mercader\u00eda que vend\u00eda fue formando su pulper\u00eda la cual tiene m\u00e1s productos que antes y sobre todo que la mayor\u00eda de sus clientes siempre est\u00e1n satisfecho pues encuentran lo que buscan y trata d darles una buena atenci\u00f3n.

This group has 4 members who live in the community of Acatlan de Perez Figueroa that is known for being located in the sugar cane belt and everyone works in the planting and growing of sugar cane. \r\n\r\nOscar, 28, didn\u2019t finish school and is single. He tells us that his parents taught him how to work for a living at a very young age. Four years ago, he decided to open his own tortilla business (in this region, it is customary for the \u201ctortilla man\u201d to sell tortillas door-to-door by putting a basket on his motorcycle and transporting his tortillas from house to house). He owns his motorcycle so he starts his work day by going to buy tortillas at 6am and then selling them on the streets of his neighborhood. Since he\u2019s been in this line of work for several years, he already has many clients which makes his work a little easier. He needs this loan in order to invest in buying tortillas and for the maintenance of his motorcycle. He hopes that this loan will help his business to continue prospering and that he will gain more clients every day in order to increase his income.\r\n\r\nThe other members who make up this group include Alicia who sells snacks, Blanca who sells clothing and Martin who is an electrician. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1059455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy and sell tortillas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":7749.99,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7783.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656814},{"amount":408.33,"local_amount":5166.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5189.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317484},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":7749.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7783.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418868},{"amount":408.33,"local_amount":5166.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5189.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568446},{"amount":408.34,"local_amount":5166.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5189.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399783}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T00:40:53Z","paid_date":"2012-09-19T08:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":411570,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is 28 years old and married with two children.

","en":"Asmar is 38 years old.  Her childhood was spent in the Sadovoe village.  After finishing ninth grade of the secondary school and according to an ancient tradition (which outlived itself today), she was stolen for marriage.  Having become a homemaker, Asmar gave birth to three children and, in search of a source of income for her family, started a business in animal husbandry.  Having started with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Asmar was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 11,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and milk products.  Today her business contains two dairy cows and one horse.  In order to further develop her business, Asmar requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into educating her son, who attends a technical college, and into expanding her business in the future.

natives of Pinotepa Nacional, where the chilena is danced, land of indigenous people.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Juliana, a hardworking, humble, happy, and talkative woman, who makes her living selling fish and bimbunuelos (a crispy wheel-shaped pastry). She tells us that she only sells bimbunuelos in December. The types of fish she sells include: sea bass, snapper, carp, clams, y crab. Juliana buys her fish by the kilo. Every third day she buys sixty kilos of assorted fish.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she goes to sell with her husband Baltasar in neighboring towns. Baltasar leaves her in a town called Jicayan while he goes to sell in San Juan and Santiago. When he finishes, he passes through Jicayan and the two of them return to their house. Juliana has five children: Baltasar is twenty-two years old, Antonio is twenty, Victor is fifteen, Elena Edith is seventeen, and Oscar is fourteen. They also accompany their mother to sell when they have days off.\r\n\r\nJuliana tells us that she sells all her fish in a single day, so her clients place orders. Since they recommend her, she occasionally gives them a fish so that they have enough left over for broth.\r\n\r\nJuliana requested the loan in order to buy more fish to sell, including clams, crabs, sea bass, snapper, and carp. She tells us that she is content with her business and with all the blessings God has given her so that she can succeed in her business.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the foundation for wanting to help hardworking people and to change their lives.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nVictorina-makes a living selling Mexican antojitos (Mexican snacks bought at street stands)\r\nBaltazar-makes a living from his taxi service\r\nMayra Cristina-makes a living selling candy\r\nJuliana-makes a living selling soft drinks\r\nVer\u00f3nica-makes a living selling

Her family lives in their own ger, a traditional Mongolian felt tent, which is located in the outer ger district (a district without basic infrastructure) of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.\r\n\r\nTsatsral has been supporting her family by operating a clothing retail stall at Mongolia's largest outdoor market for six years, with the help of her spouse. She usually sells women's clothes, which she imports from Ereen, a border city between Mongolia and China. As she is a friendly person, she already has her own constant customers. Tsatsral wants to expand her business in order to increase her working capital. \r\n\r\nSo she is requesting a 1,800,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) loan to purchase clothes from Ereen city to sell during this high shopping season. Her long-term goal is to improve her living conditions by renovating her current small ger.\r\n\r\nShe is a group leader and she has her hand up in the picture.

Over the years she has proven herself to be a strong woman, a fighter who raised 8 children alone after suffering the loss of her beloved husband.  She used to sell groceries and drinks, but unfortunately her son became gravely ill.  She was alone with her small children and had to dedicate herself to her son.  She bought all of the medicine that her son needed and paid for the doctor's visits.  Bit by bit her business fell apart, because she didn't have time to work there and the little money that she made she used for her young son.  \r\n\r\nAfter this large challenge, and her son's recovery, she decided to start over. Her shop no longer had anything to sell, and she didn't have much money to purchase more products, so she decided to sell chanfainita (a Peruvian dish) on the weekends.  She has to get up very early to shop for what she needs and of course has to give her best so that her dishes are delicious.  Georgia also sells seasonal fruit, so she is currently selling mangoes and pacay fruit, which brings in a little extra money. \r\n\r\nGregoria has requested our support to help her achieve her dream of reopening her grocery store.  For this reason she need to purchase rice, sugar, paper towels, napkins, coffee, milk, etc. so that she can have the great shop she had before. This will make her very content and she will be able to improve her quality of life so that her children are proud of her and continue to be independent and supportive, as always.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1060478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to reopen her grocery store and purchase rice, sugar, napkins, coffee, milk, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":75.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":75.89,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602121},{"amount":31.66,"local_amount":79.17,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091243},{"amount":32.62,"local_amount":81.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":87.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298374},{"amount":69.01,"local_amount":172.51,"processed_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":184.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351127},{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":90.87,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345690}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T22:40:59Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":411810,"name":"Manchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manchita works hard to support her family.

She became involved in animal husbandry 20 years ago, having started this business with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS). At the present time, Anarkul's business yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.  Anarkul also works on 3.60 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows cereal crops.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkul requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls for fattening up and resale. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into expanding her business further.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1067271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Frunze village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-11T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-11T21:00:06Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":40270.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329760},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":40270.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754626}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T02:50:26Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:22:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":411808,"name":"Lailanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lailanie is married and she works hard to support her family.

The city of Cartago was founded in 1563 by the Spanish conquistador Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado. It served as the capital of Costa Rica until 1823 and was the seat of the first permanent international court in world history, the Court of Cartago. Its mountainous landscape is formed by two mountain ranges: the Central range and the range of Talamanca. \r\n\r\nCristina makes her living as a seamstress. She makes pieces of clothing commissioned by neighbors in the community and also sells some clothing for children as well as curtains that she makes herself. For this, she needs to buy fabrics, thread, and other materials.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that she is requesting a loan in the amount of 700,000.00 CRC in order to buy a certain quantity of fabric, accessories, and other materials.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that she has requested for the project and she assures us that it is a great blessing both for her and for her family, since this way she will be able to give them a better quality of life.

She has two daughters and five sons.  She is married, and she lives in the La Concepcion village in the Juticalpa municipality.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been making and selling doughnuts and quesadillas for more than 15 years. She learned this trade because she worked with a neighbor making the same products.  She also learned thanks to several bakery courses she took at the Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her home, and still has no name. Her work schedule starts at 4:00 am, and she works with her two daughters. They help her to prepare the dough, and then spend the time it takes for the products to be in the oven. Once she takes the product out of the oven, she places it in a plastic container, and takes it to sell door-to-door to homes and businesses. She thinks that her major advantage is that her products have a special flavor, and, in addition to that, she is a friendly person who gets on well with other people.  This helps her to make sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a place in the town center, even if it is small, so that she no longer has to sell by foot and can have an easier life.  She has diabetes and is still undergoing medical treatment. Every time she returns to her home after finishing her daily work, her health suffers.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandrina is requesting is needed to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter and other ingredients to make doughnuts and quesadillas. With the help of this loan, she will be able to generate earnings and cover her medical expenses. She will also help her husband with the financial upkeep of the household.  He works in agriculture and has little income. She also would like to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been receiving the support of loans through FAMA for several years.  She has punctually paid back the loans, and they have helped her to keep her business active and to improve her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":862398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3096.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277415791},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3096.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476835},{"amount":325,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6192.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850558}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T04:00:21Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":410311,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, conviviente y con 2 hijos a cargo.

The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Rezo will purchase a milk cow. He will place it in the old cattle-shed located in his yard. He will start the production of cheese and sell it on local open market. The income for the family will increase by 150 \u2013 200 Laris, which will mean 45 \u2013 60% increase. The living conditions for the family will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

his retired father. The family owns a vineyard from which  Valodia produces wine to sell in the village. Total average family monthly income is 200 Laris. According to Credo estimations, they belong to the subsistence-poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nValodia has requested a loan to begin a new agricultural business, the raising of calves. He will purchase 10 \u2013 11 calves to raise in an old cattle-shed located in his yard. After six months he will sell the grown calves for a profit. Valodia hopes that with a second future loan he will be able to purchase more calves to raise. The family's income will significantly increase, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions. Also, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.<p>\r\n\r\nValodia's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and follow-up loans to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Hisham appears in her Kiva profile photo. The photo is taken next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nHelala is a thirty-seven-year-old woman. She is married and has no children yet. Her husband has been a taxi driver for twelve years which is a profitable project.\r\n\r\nHelala is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi and making some necessary repairs to it such as changing the tires and the mats. By taking this loan, Helala will help her husband to repair his taxi which is the only source of income for the family. This will improve the taxi's condition for the better and will enable Helala's husband to work extra hours and increase the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

One of the main resources of Los Bancos is water since a large number of streams and springs originate there and form several large rivers.

Usually local farmers and ranchers use it to transport supplies or animals. His working day is eight hours long on average, and he works alone.

Jorge needs a loan to pay for the repairs so that he can continue in this line of work.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, Kiva's local partner.
