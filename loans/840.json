She lives in a polygamous family with her children, her husband and his other wife in the prefecture of Koutiala.\r\n\r\nUnable to get a formal education, Mrs. Adiaratou started to work in trade at an early age alongside her mother. After conducting several income-generating activities, she turned to the sale of clothing, wax pagnes, incense, etc. over twenty years ago. Her good reputation brings her many orders every month. \r\n\r\nEager to expand her activity and achieve customer satisfaction, she quickly joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso several years ago. She previously obtained four group loans from Soro Yiriwaso, all of which were correctly repaid. She is now seeking her third individual loan. She buys her merchandise from merchants at the big market of Bamako (capital of Mali), in Lom\u00e9, and often in Koutiala. She plans to buy 20 wax pagnes, some perfume for the incense, and many other miscellaneous items. She sells her goods to a mixed clientele in the city of Koutiala and at the weekly fairs of surrounding villages, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 95,000CFAF, which she will use to repay the loan interest and to help with the family\u2019s daily expenditures. In future years, she plans to open a shop to sell clothing and various items at the Koutiala market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1068303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy pagnes and various merchandise for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiaratou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411016},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502844},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498889},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83529.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243219},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179694},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83529.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636141}],"funded_date":"2012-04-25T20:35:12Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":412207,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a 31-year old married man with children living in Fort Portal Uganda.

She has a small sewing shop in her home, where she makes a wide array of clothing items.  She sews both men and women's clothing, and she is currently very busy sewing school uniforms, since it is almost time to sign up for classes and the children and teenagers need their uniforms. She has been doing this daily for over 15 years, and she has hardly ever lacked for work. She gets help from her daughter. On weekends she sells barbecued chicken also from home, which brings in some extra income.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing materials to make her clothes.

Don Pedro y su esposa hace alg\u00fan tiempo se dedicaban a vender abarroter\u00eda en general, a trav\u00e9s del tiempo su negocio iba decayendo ya que ten\u00edan mucha competencia por lo que decidi\u00f3 en poner una peque\u00f1a librer\u00eda que poco a poco ha incrementado su clientela y por lo tanto sus ventas. El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita don Pedro lo necesita para la  compra de libretas, cuadernos \u00fanicos, l\u00e1pices, borradores, reglas, colores, marcadores, etc. Una de las dificultades de don Pedro ha sido la falta de dinero para invertirlo en la compra de producto para poder surtir su librer\u00eda con los materiales necesarios y que pueda tener mayor variedad, para que sus clientes siempre encuentren lo que necesiten. El est\u00e1 seguro que con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo sus ventas aumentaran y por lo tanto sus ingresos tambi\u00e9n. Su sue\u00f1o es hacer crecer su negocio y tenerlo mejor surtido. Ha tenido cinco ciclos con FAMA y no ha tenido problemas de mora, ya que ahorra a diario para pagar la cuota puntualmente.","en":"Pedro is 55 years old, is married and has six children.  He\u2019s a person of limited means but is also a very hard worker.  Pedro and his wife have been selling general groceries for some time.  Over time their business began going under, due to all the competition, so he decided to open a small bookstore.  The number of customers, and therefore sales, have been growing little by little.  Pedro needs this loan to buy pads of paper, notebooks, pencils, erasers, rulers, crayons, markers, etc.  One of Pedro\u2019s challenges has been the lack of capital to invest and stock his store with the necessary materials to have a large variety so that his customers will always find what they need.

Thanks to the loan they were able to solve this problem and despite the hard winter they were able to repay it on time.\r\n\r\nNorma is one of the group\u2019s members.  She\u2019s 41 years old and is in a live in relationship through which she had three children, ages 21, 18, and 15.  The two oldest are university students and the youngest attends school.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a good mother and housewife who also became a merchant in order to help her husband with the household expenses.  She sells household and personal products, such as irons, fans, shoes, and perfumes among many other things.  She sells door to door, offers her products to her customers, takes orders, and delivers her merchandise on credit.  She collects each week.  She\u2019s been doing this for seven years and things are going well for her, but things have gotten better now that she can get loans.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy perfumes, shoes, irons, toasters, and other things.  She\u2019s been a member of the communal bank from the beginning and she enjoys it because it helps her obtain loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her business.\r\n\r\nThe small photograph is of two members who could not be present when the group photo was taken.  The children are some of the members\u2019.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6175,"image":{"id":1058180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T22:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T22:20:01Z","loan_amount":6175,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia Monserrate Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gema Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kerly Jahaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"David Patricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredy Humberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katiuska Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thalia Monserrate ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johana Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":770}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1543.75,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646332},{"amount":1543.75,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:47:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321411},{"amount":1543.75,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209008},{"amount":1543.75,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335323}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T10:24:31Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

esposa, Rufino empez\u00f3 a emprender solo una vida comercial, ya que sus hijos son mayores de edad e independientes. Rufino siempre quiso convertirse en profesor, ya que siempre ha percibido en s\u00ed mismo que tiene el don para ense\u00f1ar, pero lamentablemente no pudo cumplir este sue\u00f1o debido a que sus padres no ten\u00edan el ingreso necesario para poder pagar sus estudios.\n\nRufino ha afrontado muchos retos y poco a poco ha logrado surgir, es por eso que con mucho esfuerzo logr\u00f3 juntar poco de dinero, es as\u00ed como abri\u00f3 su tienda, la cual actualmente es alquilada y en ella se dedica a la venta de ropa. \n\nActualmente Rufino necesita un poco de apoyo, ya que con esto lograra invertir en la compra de ropa nueva (Polos, Shorts, Pantalones,etc.), ya que sus clientes siempre le preguntan si tiene nuevos modelos o dise\u00f1os, es entonces este el principal motivo por el que quiere crecer como microempresario, ya que sabe que sus ingresos mejorar\u00e1n.

He once wanted to become a teacher, since he has always seen himself as having a talent for teaching but, unfortunately, he was not able to realize this dream because his parents did not have the money to pay for his studies. \r\n\r\nRufino has confronted many challenges and has gradually excelled. Consequently through a great deal of hard work he was able to accumulate enough money to open his store in a rented space. There he sells clothing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rufino needs a little help in order to purchase new clothing (polo shirts, shorts, pants, etc). His customers are always asking him if he has the latest models and designs. This is the main reason that he wants to grow as a small businessman: he knows that if he has more inventory, his income will improve.

","en":"Shuhrat is a young family man; he has children and works together with his wife, Holiskhon, to support the family.  Shuhrat's wife used to work outside the city limits, but because Shuhrat's health did not allow him to come with his wife, he remained at home and watched after the children.  Shuhrat's profession is in high demand in his village; he is a welder and makes metal goods to-order and for sale.  He used his savings to buy several heads of small livestock a few years ago and has been consistently taking this livestock to a pasture since then and using this income to add to the family's budget.  He used a loan to buy one bull, and the earning from cattle also turned out to be good.  Now, Shuhrat plans to buy another cow and fatten it up until he has large expenses because he had already sold his livestock several times and covered his expenses for family needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1068166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Chayruh Dayron","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-04-13T02:00:50Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-13T02:00:50Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shuhrat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1967.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2032.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":418.12,"local_amount":1967.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1989.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452276},{"amount":431.88,"local_amount":2032.37,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212526}],"funded_date":"2012-04-20T12:44:15Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":411175,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to make the initial payment on at moto-taxi for his son.

","en":"Mirzojon is a 51 year-old man, who has a higher medical education.  He is a father of four children, works at the district hospital as a therapist.  He has many patients because he is in high demand in the villages due to the fact that there are not many such professionals there.  The family's additional income comes from fattening up goats and sheep that Mirzojon keeps at home.

Sobir's father came first to our organization and received a loan to buy cattle. They liked our process and by being our clients they have greatly improved their living conditions.

The group is comprised of six women who grow greenhouse vegetables such as tomatoes, green beans, sweet pepper, as well as coffee.  The group's goal is to obtain additional income through the farm activities to help community families with productive projects aimed at conservation and rational use of resources.\r\n\r\nThe main activities of the Association are:\r\n\r\n1.  Coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Farm Development and other public institutions of Costa Rica to obtain technical assistance services offered by these institutions.\r\n2.

","en":"Maria is 45, she lives with her husband, and they have two children of ages 19 and 22. She and her husband have a corn husking machine, which they use for threshing. They sell the threshed corn and also market it whole. They learned the trade by family tradition, from their respective parents, who sold it to them 12 years ago. From that point on, the couple have been in this business, which they fully rely on today, since it generates the income to support their household.\r\nHer goal is to expand their capability to purchase corn, in order to generate larger profits and achieve their desired sustainability. Currently Maria is requesting a Kiva loan, which she will use to purchase larger amounts of corn. Buying this way provides her with discounts, which will allow her to offer better prices.\r\nShe is also planning to tackle a new market, purchasing yams and plantains to sell, for she has orders waiting to be filled. The success of this investment is that she knows her customers very well and she will base her work on orders from her best charge buyers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1061768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Now that the holy week is approaching and this is the season when fish consumption and avocado salad increases, Marybel and her husband take advantage and buy larger quantities and make greater sales than normal.  But her lack of working capital with which to invest in greater volumes is a big challenge, because the money is not enough to respond to increased customer demand.  This is why she\u2019s requesting a Kiva loan.  This is the first loan she\u2019s getting through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy avocados and fish.  Her investment will be successful because she\u2019s doing it at an appropriate time, when her demand and orders from her customers will increase.  She wants to satisfy them with fresh products at good prices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1061436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish and avocado.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-14T02:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-14T02:00:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marybel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42037},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44885},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45932},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47004},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":48101},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49223},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50372},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51547},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52750},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":53981},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":55240},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58928}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.52,"local_amount":42037,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":43452.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651565},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":44885,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46396.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141200},{"amount":26.79,"local_amount":45932,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":47478.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101083},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":47004,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":48586.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338697},{"amount":28.06,"local_amount":48101,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49720.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395262},{"amount":28.71,"local_amount":49223,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50880.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775067},{"amount":29.38,"local_amount":50372,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52067.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387054},{"amount":30.07,"local_amount":51547,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":53282.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993914},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":52750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54525.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130274},{"amount":31.49,"local_amount":53981,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":55798.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519166},{"amount":66.61,"local_amount":114168,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":118011.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071008}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T15:37:07Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Una vez dio curso a su idea emprendedora, empez\u00f3 su progreso y lo hizo  para lograr mayor autonom\u00eda mientras generaba ingresos para apoyar el bienestar propio y el de su familia. En la actualidad tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de productos variados, como accesorios femeninos, calzado, bolsos etc., Su gran desaf\u00edo es que ante la creciente clientela, su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente para responder a la demanda del mercado. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas en mayor proporci\u00f3n, para ganar descuentos y tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 en mercanc\u00edas como ropa, art\u00edculos para el hogar, los cuales est\u00e1n encargados por sus clientes con quienes negocia a cr\u00e9dito en plazos pactados conjuntamente. Su meta es continuar el crecimiento de su negocio y proyectar un futuro exitoso para sus hijos. ","en":"Marly is 33-years-old and lives in Cartagena where she has her business selling tamales, a dough from flour or rice with vegetables and chicken or pork.  There she also sells the famous enyucados, a sweet cake baked from cassava (yucca root), cheese, coconut, and sugar.  Marly learned how to make these products from her husband when he worked for the Colombian Navy, which he is now retired from and receiving a pension.  As soon as she thought of her business idea, she began working towards it to achieve greater independence while earning income to support her own well-being and that of her family.  \r\n\r\nCurrently she is also working selling various products such as feminine accessories like shoes, bags, etc.  Her biggest challenge is that with her growing clientele, her working capital is not sufficient to respond to the demand for products.  This is the reason why she has come to Kiva for her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy supplies in larger quantities in order to get discounts and which she will also invest in merchandise like clothing and items for the home which her customers have ordered on credit with payment plans they have jointly decided on.  Her goal is to continue to grow her business and plan a successful future for her children.

daughters who are still in school. Rice farming is the primary source of income for her family to support their living. To earn more income, she plants some cassava on her 0.5 hectare of farmland. She has been in this business for 12 years. Currently, she can earn about US$3 per day from her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva's field partner, VisionFund, with her group of two female members. After successfully paying back the first loan, she could afford to buy a small plot of farmland for a plantation. Now she is leading her group to apply for another loan with VisionFund.

Working 7 days a week and 16 hours a day, he earns about 1,500,000 Sierra Leone leones (SLL) every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Unisa has already received and successfully repaid a loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy cigarettes, mayonnaise, sardines, milk, and soap.\n\nUnisa hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately  400,000 SLL. In the future, Unisa plans to own a house, to establish a larger business, and to travel to the holy land of Mecca. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1029590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy provisions, soap, and cigarettes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-04-14T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-14T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Unisa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":846979.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815489},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":846979.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444543},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":846979.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537253},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":2500000.01,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2540937.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284720}],"funded_date":"2012-04-20T13:26:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":402111,"name":"Abu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 34 year-old Abu.

A este negocio se dedic\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge una vez se independiz\u00f3 su c\u00f3nyuge de su anterior empleo y con ella dio curso libre a su negocio. Ellos con un molino el\u00e9ctrico, una estufa industrial, poncheras y latas, entre otras herramientas, desarrollan toda una operaci\u00f3n productiva: en las horas de la tarde empiezan el proceso de cocci\u00f3n del ma\u00edz, elaboraci\u00f3n de masas y armado de producto; se levantan muy temprano y a las 4:00 a.m. contin\u00faan  las tareas que el d\u00eda de ayer hab\u00edan dejado hecha en parte; asan las arepas, envuelven en bandejas y en pl\u00e1sticos transparentes y pasan directo al congelador. Sus principales clientes son colegios, cafeter\u00edas, empresas, tiendas y hospitales. Dunis tiene inmensos deseos de tener ingresos para lograr el bienestar de su familia por eso realiza una actividad simultanea que es la de elaborar piezas de hierro, negocio que desarrolla con su hermano. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr captar muchos mas clientes por eso est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1 ma\u00edz, queso, en mayor volumen envases desechables, para aumentar la producci\u00f3n de pasabocas, aprovechando que cada vez mas tienen nuevos pedidos y esto hace exitosa esta inversi\u00f3n.

He dedicated himself to this business with his spouse once she quit her previous job and, with her, gave free rein to their business.With an electric grinder, an industrial stove, bowls and cans, among other tools, they developed a productive operation: in the afternoons they begin the process of baking the maize, making dough and product assembly. They get up very early and at 4AM conitnue their work that they had started the day before: grilling the arepas, wrapping in trays and in transparant plastic and going straight to the freezer.\r\n\r\nTheir main customers are high schools, cafeterias, companies, shops and hospitals. Dunis has immense wishes to have income to achieve the wellbeing of his family. For this, he performs a simulataneous activity, which is making iron pieces, a business that he is developing with his brother. His greatest challenge is to find more customers. For this, he is applying for a CrediKiva, the first loan that he's made with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy maize and cheese in greater volume in disposable containers to expand the production of snacks, increasingly taking advantage of new orders and this makes the investment successful. Dunis' greatest dream is to have his own house and to provide his daughter with the best education possible.

This is an area that scores low on development indices as it is in area where the main economic activity is cultivating the oil palm, an activity that predominantly employs men to harvest the fruit. This means that the women have few opportunities for paid employment. This is why Elsie works raising and fattening pigs - to help her partner with the household expenses. This loan, like the loans she had when she was a member of BM Laskmi, will be used to buy pigs, concentrate, and vaccines for the duration of the production cycle. She will make weekly repayments. Thanks to her work and the salary that her husband brings in (he is a teacher at a school that is on the border of Costa Rica and Panama) she has been able to send a son to the the University of Costa Rica to study business. He has a scholarship but it does not cover all of his expenses so he needs support from his parents to be able to complete his studies. Elsie also wants to support her daughter who wants to study culinary arts at the National Training Institute, an institution that teaches trades to build-up the labor market. Elsie and her husband are convinced that giving their children an education is the way to improve their quality of life.

She is a single mother, and she currently sells seasonal fruit.  She came to the tropics from another community where there was too much poverty.  She came looking for a greater opportunity to work and a better standard of living for herself and her young daughter. In the past seasons her community was affected by the rivers flooding, and it affected her crops.  She barely managed to survive.\r\n\r\nShe says that when she came she brought a few clothes.  In the first few years after she came she helped carry seasonal fruit and take it to the city of Santa Cruz to sell.  She still was not able to find secure work.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she was learning the business of selling fruit in order to later enter this field.  She works very hard to get her child ahead and so that her child will lack nothing in the future.\r\n\r\nAs time passed she was saving little by little.  She bought an urban lot, and she made a small room where she currently lives.\r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a loan for working capital.  She will use the loan to buy more fruit in order to continue growing.  This way she will overcome this very poor situation in which she lives.  Later she wants to improve her house.  To do so she needs to increase her income.  With the loan she will be able to increase her income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1061795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &
