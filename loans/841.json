They all live in the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of Mali) and know each other through familial, neighbourhood, and marital relations. The group members run small businesses selling fabric, pagnes (a type of brightly-printed West African clothing), ginger, rice, and plates. With the goal of increasing their capital, the group members joined Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first solidarity (group) loan cycle.\r\nMs. Ami (the woman all the way on the right in the photo) is one of the fabric and pagne retailers in the group. She intends to use her loan to buy ten sets of pagnes. She gets her supplies on the spot from wholesalers and sells her goods at retail, in cash and on credit, at home and at the market, to a clientele composed essentially of women. With this loan, Ms. Wassa intends to realize an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and to take care of certain household needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1070149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy pagnes (a type of brightly-printed West African clothing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-04-14T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-14T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283252027},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411031},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449150},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502856},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502857},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268514}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T14:58:41Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":411328,"name":"Rosibel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nRosibel de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, habita junto a sus padres e hijos.

With this support, she will be able to increase her income and her quality of life, which will motivate her more and help her to achieve her dream: \"improving her home and giving her greater mobility.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1062882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

She is not married and lives with her family. Gulsah has two siblings and is the middle child.  Her father is a tradesman and her mother is a housewife.  Gulsah, when describing herself and her chosen profession, says \"'because I love playing with women's hair, I chose this profession. I started playing with my dolls' hair as a child and it awakened my curiosity.  I love my job.\"  \r\n\r\nShe has worked hard in order to be competent in her profession at such a young age.  After working with (being apprenticed to) a hairdresser for seven years, she completed her training. After meeting with Maya, Gulsah was able to start on her dream of opening a hairstyling business.  She named it Koko\u015f\u0131 (the closest translation is Chic).  Her work and her shop are incredibly beautiful because she opened it completely through her own efforts and labor.\r\n\r\nGulsah has been a Maya client for five credit cycles and has used the loans to refresh and develop her shop.  She has literally given her shop some of her own beauty and charm.  This is her sixth credit cycle with Maya and her first through Kiva. She will use this loan to buy materials and pay for labor so she can add a waxing room. This waxing room will enable to her expand her services. This is one more step towards her future dream of developing her business into a full service beauty salon. Gulsah is such a bright and ambitious young woman: it is easy to believe that she will be able to realize her future dreams. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Volunteers\r\n\r\n G\u00fcl\u015fah ,1991 Eski\u015fehir do\u011fumlu bekar 3 \u00e7ocuklu bir ailenin ortaca \u00e7ocu\u011fu .

As he grew, Chris learned to DJ by helping his father during events. Since then, Chris, 27, has learned new tricks, but he credits most of what he knows to his father\u2019s guidance. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, he\u2019s worked as a DJ, but as of March 2012, he completed his first year as an entrepreneur with his San Antonio business: I.C.A.D.J. Entertainment. At some point, Chris hopes to hire more DJs, but at the moment, he is focused on doing his own work. \r\n\r\nAside from being a DJ, Chris works for Time Warner, sells travel packages for another company and, in his free time, assists other DJs. He said not being in only one field of work helps him be a better person. He decided to become an entrepreneur after he realized that he could grow monetarily while using his communication strengths to his advantage.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe unique thing about me, I don\u2019t require multiple DJs.\u201d he said. With him as the only DJ, Chris said, there is more room for personal time with the client or coordinator. \u201cIt allows me to give better value in price,\u201d Chris said, adding, \u201cI deliver value on all events.\u201d \r\n\r\nDuring events, Chris includes a variety of lights to give a club vibe. Chris said it doesn\u2019t matter how many lights a DJ has, what\u2019s important is what he does with them. \r\n\r\nPrior to contacting ACCION Texas Inc., Chris discussed the possibility of applying for a loan at Security Service Federal Credit Union. Afterwards, a SSFCU employee approached him and introduced ACCION to Chris.\r\n \r\nChris will use the loan to upgrade his equipment and repair his vehicle that transports him to events. His list includes a pair of 18\u201d Harbinger speakers for better sound, and lights, some of which are still working but are old, he said. He is also interested in purchasing laser lights. The rest of the loan will contribute to online marketing with the North Chamber of Commerce. \r\n\r\nChris said he is excited and looks forward to making good use of the loan and turning it into something better. \u201cMy goal is to improve annually,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big step for me.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1066816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

One of Honoria's challenges is that when it is freezes, some of the plants are burned by the cold and she has to put down good fertilizer so that they can withstand the inclement weather.  \r\n\r\nShe says that this loan would help her very much since she would be able to purchase the necessary items for her trees so that she could earn income to then give a better quality of life to her small children.

They will invest their loans in fruits and vegetables, ornamental plants, and material to do embroidery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1062173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase avocado trees and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Honoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":338.9,"local_amount":4280.88,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4327.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656830},{"amount":365.65,"local_amount":4618.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4668.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317503},{"amount":381.57,"local_amount":4819.84,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4872.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418888},{"amount":398.26,"local_amount":5030.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5085.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568466},{"amount":415.62,"local_amount":5249.95,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5307.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399793}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:01:18Z","paid_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":413234,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a pottery business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 12,000 through NWTF to buy materials needed for her pottery business.\r\n\r\nGemma has been in this business for two years.

She notes hat she will use the loan to buy a greater variety of clothing and that the funding will help her because she will have a source of employment to support her children and she will be able to assist her husband with household expenses.\r\n\r\nLeo\u2019s goal is to increase her business more since she wants to have it very well stocked. She says that during this summer season she wants to buy cotton t-shirts, girl\u2019s pants and boy\u2019s bathing trunks. \r\n\r\nLeo states that she is very grateful to FRAC because, thanks to the loans they have provided, her business has grown, little by little.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Audelia, Josefina, Candelaria and Yolanda. They will invest their loans in their businesses consisting of hosiery  and haberdashery, a coffee bar, a grocery store, in napkins and cooking pots, in a combination of public service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1062168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The members decided to give it this name because the owner of the house where they meet has a small garden with three jasmine plants.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Quintila, who is 54 years old and a widow for more than ten years.  She has six children, of whom only Aleida is a student; she is in the second year of high school.  All the others are already married.  She has worked selling meat, chorizo, and chicken for seven years.  She decided to get into this business because she wanted to find the way to get her child ahead and to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is going to invest the loan she received in buying more meat, chorizo, and chicken to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nQuintila is very happy because she says it is going very well for her with her business.

In this way her daughter can have a good professional career.\r\n\r\nThe goal she says she has for her business is to continue investing in her business to make it grow quickly, because what she really wants is to build a small store to set up her butcher shop to have better sales and stock as well as more and better profits.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and the Kiva

These include repairing his roof, which is made of bamboo and clay, as well as replacing his gate, which is old and rusty.

These improvements will ensure that Percy has better security for his business and can provide his customers with more comfort when they visit his shop.  The improvements will also allow Percy to keep working and to achieve his biggest dream: for his children to find good professions and, most importantly, for them to be happy.

Her life and her family\u2019s life will also change.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and the activities they carry out are as follows: \r\n\r\nBlanca-clothing store\r\nFrancisca-milk sales\r\nClaudia-sewing workshop\r\nJuana-laundry \r\nJonaz-grocery store\r\nMaribel-sale of items for the home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5875,"image":{"id":1062181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes and sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ometepec,Gro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":5875,"lender_count":186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7403.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8335.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8825.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9155.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9592.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10099.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10533.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":11053.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":652.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":751.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":791.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":865.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":579.97,"local_amount":7403.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7405.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317501},{"amount":652.95,"local_amount":8335.53,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418886},{"amount":691.3,"local_amount":8825.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8827.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568464},{"amount":1426.84,"local_amount":18215.04,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18219.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399792},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":533.1,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":533.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407533},{"amount":791.15,"local_amount":10099.89,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10102.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392087},{"amount":825.13,"local_amount":10533.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119956},{"amount":865.89,"local_amount":11053.88,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11056.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068023}],"funded_date":"2012-05-15T18:11:41Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":413335,"name":"Mila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mila is recognized as an oriented person.

selected by the members because, since they are pure women, they can be considered beautiful like flowers, and because the community they all belong to also bears that name.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Juana, one of the group members. She is 44 years old and a single mother with 6 children, of whom only Abel is in school, in the 3rd year of pre-school. All her other children are married. Juana has sold cut-up chicken for over 6 years.\r\n\r\nJuana says that she decided on this activity while searching for a way to offer a better quality of life for her family and a good education for her children, and she wanted to enjoy more stability and economic solvency. The loan she requests will be used to buy more chickens at wholesale and continue her sales.\r\n\r\nJuana's goal is to provide a good education for her son, so he can continue to study and have a profession. Also, she wants to make her business grow much more, since she is thinking of starting construction on her own cut-up chicken shop and thus, have a much greater selection in a shop that will improve and increase her income.\r\n\r\nJuana is very grateful for FRAC and Kiva because, thanks to them, she will be able to expand her business and improve her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuana's companions are: Gloria, Maria Teresa, Maria, Esmeralda, Citlall, Rocio, Victoria, Sarahi, Guillermina, Elizabeth, Juana and Juana Gomez, each dedicated to different activities, including: sales of

","en":"This solidarity group is named Productoras del Oriente.  It is made up of Reina David, who is going to buy chicken wholesale and spice mix; Juana, who is going to buy shoes; Eulalia, who is going to buy flour and coloring to make \"obleas\" [thin wafer sandwiches filled with caramel]; Leonila, who is going to buy gumdrops, icepops, and peanuts; Dolores Olivia, who is going to buy pig feed; and Catalina, who is going to buy corn to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nEulalia, 39, is a single mother with four children, one girl and three boys.  The girl and one boy are in elementary school, and the two older boys already work.  She makes obleas to sell.  She requested the loan to buy flour, sugar, coloring, oil, plastic bags, and packing tape to produce the obleas.\r\n\r\nShe began her business six years ago.  As part of a project she was given the raw materials and an oblea machine.  Her business is important because it is where she gets the money to eat, to give her children breakfast, and to pay the school expenses.  She is proud to have her business in her house.  She works and can attend to her children.\r\n\r\nHer dreams and hopes are to expand her business, to buy another oblea machine, and for her children to be well.  She is happy about the loan she is going to receive.  She is going to buy the ingredients to continue working and making more obleas.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are grateful to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  Thanks to their loans they continue working in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1061729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, sugar, oil, coloring, plastic bags, and packing tape.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Popotlan, Temoac, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores Olivia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9097.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656835},{"amount":475,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6065.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317509},{"amount":475,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6065.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418894},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568470}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T16:12:13Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":413344,"name":"Edilberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edilberta works hard to support her family.

With the loan, she will buy construction materials that will help her change the level of the walls of her house, and improve the roofing also. She is grateful for the help of the microfinance institution; for their support in improving her standard of living and the condition of her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1063116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing
