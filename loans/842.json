She married V\u00edctor and they have three children. The oldest couldn't attend university due to their economic situation. Thanks to this, he traveled to Brazil and is currently helping with the university studies of their second son. The youngest is studying at a public elementary school in the area where they live. Alicia lived with her parents with whom she worked on farming production during her childhood. Once she got married, her parents gave her her inheritance where she currently lives with her family. This is in the area of Caramarca in the city of Cochabamba. It's one of the areas that has the greatest production of onion, corn, potato, and other crops as it is fit for their production. The family makes a living sowing corn, potato, and onion. During this month they will begin to sow potato but Alicia doesn't have cash to buy seeds and fertilizer. For this reason she is requesting the loan. Ideally Alicia would like to have her two oldest sons be professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1061802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds, organic fertilizer, and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-04-16T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-16T08:40:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301363239},{"amount":683.33,"local_amount":4666.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4687.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322968107}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T16:50:03Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:59:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":411912,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is a widow with two children, both of whom graduated from school.

Mariam is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in Kampala, a region in the eastern part of Uganda. For the past year, Mariam has been working hard to manage her mobile business, through which she sells clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Mariam to generate greater profits and increase the capital in her business. Mariam hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \n\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Mariam's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Hellen is 22 years old and lives in the town of Nateete in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is single and has two children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past two years, Hellen has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale, and will help Hellen to generate greater profits and pay for her own house rent. Hellen hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \n\nHellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Carol is 21 years old and lives in the town of Nateete in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past 2 years, Carol has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \n\nTo help expand her business, Carol has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale, and will help Carol to generate greater profits and pay her own school fees. Carol hopes that in the future she will be able to own a designing shop. \n\nCarol is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Carol's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

","en":"Yessica, 19 years old, lives very near the sea, giving her the air of a Caribbean woman, youthful, happy, tropical, radiant and enterprising. After she completed high school, it was difficult to continue her studies so she began looking for employment in various enterprises.  When she couldn't find work, Yessica decided to start her own business in her native Puerto Colombia and, today, she wants to make the business grow. Yessica is the proprietor of an internet cafe which she began with 2 computers and gradually, with her work discipline, she now has 5, plus the necessary clientele. Each day her cafe grows a little more.\r\n\r\nYessica's main challenge is to put together sufficient working capital to provide the impulse required to fulfill her growth expectations. Her goal for the future is to have sufficient infrastructure so that her customers can be comfortable in their privacy and not feel the incessant Caribbean heat in her cafe, which can be achieved, little by little, with the acquisition of an air conditioner and individual cubicles.\r\n\r\nNow Yessica is applying for a 'credikiva' (Kiva loan), her 1st financing through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She needs this to put her dream into action, beginning by upgrading her computers and buying new components for her equipment. This will initiate Yessica's grand commercial proposition, allowing her to improve service quality in the future. We expect this investment to result in the expected success, as Yessica pursues growth step by step with much discipline.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1061462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to upgrade her computers and buy new components for the equipment in her internet cafe.

Orleans Molasses Bakery, LLC.  Using only quality ingredients, she hopes to sell her cookies wholesale to many of the local retailers in the French Quarter.  \r\n\r\nAfter Hurricane Katrina required the office that she worked in to relocate to the French Quarter, Cynthia had an opportunity to rediscover the city's famous cornerstone neighborhood.  Exploring the French Quarter on her lunch breaks, Cynthia, a New Orleans native, fell in love with the city all over again.  Wanting to start a business that celebrated the food and history of this unique city, she created the \"NOMO\" cookie.  A certified product of Louisiana, these New Orleans Molasses (NOMO) cookies are made with Steen's sugar cane syrup and each cookie is pressed with a vintage 18th century Louisiana antique mold.  The NOMO cookie is representative of the city and history that inspired it and the love that Cynthia has for creating them. \r\n\r\nAfter being unsuccessful in finding other options to fund her business, Cynthia turned to Kiva to help her grow her business.  With her Kiva loan Cynthia will purchase a professional dough sheeter that will allow her to create a consistent product.   \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva New Orleans and in partnership with Good Work Network and ASI Federal Credit Union. Kiva New Orleans is a part of Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans.

Overall, he has acquired over 24 years of experience in this field. Just recently, he decided to take the final step in becoming self-reliant by incorporating his freelance work into a formal business. \r\n\r\nLast month, Luis founded a self-titled company that does all of the graphic design and printing work for books, brochures, letterheads, and more for clients that do not have the means to do this themselves. He is also still working part-time for a larger company, but has aspirations of making this business his sole means of income soon. Luis plans to use this loan to buy a new printer to maximize his output. He also would like to buy parts to repair some of his older equipment to make his business more

his science and creative skills to the art of soap making. From his kitchen, which he named 'the lab', he founded Monkey Bar Soap. Monkey Bar Soap is an unique artisan soap manufacturing company that is committed to 100% natural, vegan soaps that use no harmful chemicals in the manufacturing process. \n\nJason produces a variety of different lines of soaps differing in color and fragrance. Currently, he has been selling his soaps on the website esty.com (http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/people\/monkeybarsoaps), however he much prefers selling in the open-air markets in his community. \n\nHe is asking for a loan to help pay for entrance fees to these markets, as well as purchase the materials he will need to manufacture in bulk.

She started this business 4 years ago, selling hot dogs and hamburgers with one table and one stove and $300,000 COP. She put them on the terrace of her house to take advantage of the fact that residents pass by there on their way home. Her dream is to have a second floor to separate her family life from the business, setting up her business with all of its infrastructure. This would allow her customers to enjoy a comfortable ambience and her to have optimal production conditions where she could do her activities and buy ingredients. Her small space is becoming a challenge, as well as her insufficient working capital for making needed changes. This is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy construction materials so she can remodel the floor on the terrace where she runs her business. With this investment, she will be able to achieve her goal and her customers will be more satisfied with an elegant area to eat their food.

With the new loan she will buy farm seedlings like beans, maize, yams and cocoyams and she also intends to undertake the sale of cooked food (koki).

The community will benefit from this activity by having a regular supply of cooked food at all times and she will be able to sell to them at low prices.\n\nChe says that, with the profit from the

The income generated from her business is used for their daily basic needs, allowances, monthly electric bill and school fees for her daughter.\r\n\r\nLa Arnie Lee has been doing her best in order to obtain success in life. Though she has only one child, her expenses are still too high because her child is studying at a private school. She wants this for her only child because she was not able to finish her studies due to an early marriage. At this time, she would like to buy mufflers, oil, tires and other kinds of spare parts for motorcycles because the products immediately sell out. With her goal of having a high income and providing her customers with quality products, she is requesting a bigger loan amount of PHP 40,000 this time. She hopes that she can obtain this loan amount. This would be a big help in making her business expand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1068217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

Her parents are retirees. She started running taxi service in 2011 with an Elantra car. This has been source of income for her and she has used it to improve the standards of living of the household. As she is a local person, she knows the routes well. \r\n\r\nDue to the bad roads in Mongolia, her car has broken down and needs to be repaired.
