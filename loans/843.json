In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1998 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Nazgul's persistent and hard work, today her business yields about 15,000 som (KGS) in monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, Nazgul requested a loan in the amount of 55,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.

Her family is also involved in beekeeping, selling honey to the local residents during the season.  Today, Natalya's business yields about 40,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Natalya requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover.

He grows vegetables and cereal crops for sale.  He sells his agricultural products: milk, meat, vegetables and cereal crops, in the city of Kapan.  Yura also owns agricultural machinery: a tractor and a press for packing hay into bales.  Yura provides paid services with the help of this machinery in the villages of the Syunik region.  This fact allows Yura to make a good profit during the agricultural season, which lasts from June through September.\r\nYura is 48 years old, married and has two children: a son and a daughter.  Yura's daughter lives with her own family separately from the parents.  Yura's son is married, and he and his family live together with the parents.  Currently, Yura's son is in Russia.  Yura's wife helps her husband with the agricultural business, and thanks to their business, they support the family.

She had the inclination for assembling crafts with hardware, making silver accessories, an activity that she learned in a workshop near her home, where she helped a neighbor that worked in silver.\r\n\r\nThrough some visual media she learned about the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and became interested in its training program for entrepreneurs and later she applied for loans with which she bought her rolling mill, with which she gradually became independent. Little by little she was thinking of diversifying her products. She bought four display cases, one motor toll, one drill press, welding equipment and also added various merchandise changing her business into a general store as she is functioning today. She is helped in her business by her sister, a friend, and her husband, who sells the items she makes. In her business she sells by credit and cash.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought for cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.

She earns a minimum of Php2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php21,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPerla fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and hopes to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She's an energetic woman, an experienced entrepreneur, and very ambitious. She's 40 years old and the mother of seven children, out of whom two are twins.\n\nShe runs a shop in downtown Goma. Her husband is a banker with a banking and real-estate company. She started her business after getting married, by selling small items to her peers.\n\nShe's been running her business for 13 years. On a regular basis, she gets a loan from Kiva's partner, Hekima, in order to bolster her business. Her profits are used for savings, for food, and to help cover her children's school expenses.\n\nShe just received her sixth loan. During the last loan cycle, her business thrived significantly. Consequently, she decided to seek a bigger loan for this new cycle. She will use her new loan to buy 50 dozen layettes in Kampala.   \n\nIn addition, she would like to see her children grow and surprise her husband by offering him a car. She thanks Hekima for its actions aimed at making low-income women self-sustaining."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1073079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 50 dozen layettes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She buys different kinds of fish at wholesale prices and sells them by the kilo. She buys fish at the local fish port early in the morning. There are many patrons who prefer her product since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. Her store is located in a temporary fish market. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more fish to be sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSenia dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNoemi oversees operations of the jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. She earns PHP1000 everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepneys, and other maintenance needs for her vehicle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNoemi dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a spirited woman who has been working in the trade sector since 2000. She started her business selling fish and vegetables at the local market. When she would get home, her neighbours would seek her out to buy the leftover condiments that she would bring home with her. This ultimately made her decide to set up a table outside her home to sell condiments; this would allow her to reclaim all the customers in the area.\r\n\r\nNdondy is part of a group of which she has been the chairwoman. She therefore has experience in the area of credit. This time, she wishes to get a loan of 75 000 francs with which to buy some palm oil to resell in the neighbourhood and on the table in front of her house.\r\n\r\nNdondy is married and the mother of a family. She supports her husband, also a trader, with the management of their daily expenses. She is in charge of paying the water and electricity bills. Everything that she does contributes towards improving her household's living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1073952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy palm oil for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-04-18T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-18T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndondy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":9375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9380.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276767647},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9380.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283412202},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9380.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287817709},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":46875,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-19T08:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":46903.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":295120968}],"funded_date":"2012-04-18T20:33:38Z","paid_date":"2012-08-19T08:18:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":414381,"name":"Norbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norbert is 35 years old.

Ella se dedica al comercio de tienda desde hace mucho tiempo. Teresa se caracteriza por ser una mujer trabajadora, honesta y con muchos deseos de superarse. Para ella lo m\u00e1s importante es su familia. No pierde las esperanzas de alg\u00fan d\u00eda ver a su hija convertida en una profesional y con mejores oportunidades de vida a las que ella tuvo acceso. Esto es lo que inspira a Teresa a trabajar duramente en su tienda  que con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado establecer. Tiene mucho tiempo de dedicarse al negocio por lo que ya logr\u00f3 ganarse la confianza de muchas personas. El objetivo de Teresa  es surtir su negocio de tal manera que la capacidad del mismo sea m\u00e1s grande y logre cubrir una mayor demanda. Esta inversi\u00f3n piensa hacerla por medio de un cr\u00e9dito ya que no cuenta con los recursos propios necesarios para hacerlo. Es por esta raz\u00f3n que ha decidido solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para comprar los productos necesarios (arroz, frijoles, pan dulce, galletas, dulces, golosinas, detergente, aceite, etc.) para mantener surtido su negocio y que le permitan alcanzar su objetivo de cubrir una mayor demanda de tal forma que sus ventas e ingresos se vean incrementados y poder as\u00ed dar a su familia diferentes oportunidades de vida.

She has been a merchant for a long time.  Teresa is noted for being a hardworking, honest woman who very much wants to get ahead.  For her, her family is most important.  She does not lose hope of someday seeing her daughter become a great professional with better life opportunities than she had access to.  \r\n\r\nThis is what motivates Teresa to work hard in her store which she\u2019s managed to set up with much effort.  She\u2019s been in business for a long time so she\u2019s won over the trust of many people.  Teresa\u2019s goal is to stock the store in such a way that its capacity will be larger and she can meet greater demand.  She plans to make this investment through a loan since she does not have means of her own to do so.\r\n\r\nBecause of this she\u2019s decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL to buy the needed products (rice, beans, sweet bread, cookies, candy, snacks, detergent, oil, etc.) to keep her store well-stocked so that she can reach her objective of meeting a greater demand so that sales and income will increase and she can give her family different life opportunities.\r\n\r\nShe is very confident that she will reach the set goal because she\u2019s a persevering woman who always reaches what she sets out to.  Teresa says that she\u2019s very grateful to the institution because she asked for a loan in the past and they gave her the support she so needed.  Thanks to it and to the excellent way she handled it, her business grew.

Rose is 22 years old and lives in the town of Nasana in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is single and has 2 children, one of which is currently in school. For the past year, Rose has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more vegetables for resale, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and pay medical expenses. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Rose's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

He has farmed cereals and vegetables for many years.  He is a very hardworking man who is noted for being responsible, dedicated and enterprising.  \r\n\r\nHe carries out this activity every year; it\u2019s his main source of income that makes it possible for him to provide daily bread for his parents.

He makes his living from the cultivation and trade of grains like corn and beans. Every year he repeats this process, planting the seed, harvesting the crop, and finally placing the majority of it on sale. This is how he makes a living and it should be clear that this is his main source of income. He does not have his own land to farm, so every year he rents a few more sections of land to continue to produce his crops, which are what have allowed him to achieve today: to grow and feed his family.\r\n\r\nManuel is known for being a hard worker, honorable, and very responsible. Many people give him good references and trust the product he sells. He has decided to work with this institution, INTEGRAL, to request a loan to buy his main agricultural supplies (seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and to rent more land than in previous years in order to produce more crops.
