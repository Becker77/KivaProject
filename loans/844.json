She\u2019s a concubine with 3 children to attend to and maintain. She is a farmer who works the land and always considers herself alone.\r\nConstancia is hard working and of a passive character, she is requesting a loan to build a house on her lot, which she could rent out to generate more income. She was told about a Kiva loan and thought it was an opportunity now that she can pay it off little by little, since her husband is a senior and not well neurologically. His behavior has become irregular and Constancia has taken him to see many specialists, with no results, even shamen. Now, she is the one in charge of the family, including taking care of her partner\u2019s needs. The house she will build will be a rental and that way she\u2019ll be able to help herself. The crop production on her piece of land is moderate, but she is happy that the Kiva loan will support her. Constancia dreams of increasing the crop production on her parcel of land, so she can feel more at peace.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1065838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"build a house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-04-18T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-18T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constancia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287308103},{"amount":125,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301363246},{"amount":125,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315358223},{"amount":126.38,"local_amount":859.38,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":866.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331103826},{"amount":124.66,"local_amount":847.71,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":855.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347045401},{"amount":124.82,"local_amount":848.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":856.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364498098},{"amount":124.4,"local_amount":845.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":853.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382130849},{"amount":124.74,"local_amount":848.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":856.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399792881},{"amount":125.15,"local_amount":851,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":858.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419832919},{"amount":125.85,"local_amount":855.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":863.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439709636},{"amount":249,"local_amount":1692.59,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T08:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468196460}],"funded_date":"2012-04-26T00:46:16Z","paid_date":"2014-04-18T08:58:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":414389,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 36-year-old, businesswoman, she is married to Peter a businessman.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRochelle hopes her business will grow in the coming years.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nKristina hopes her business would grow in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

They are in their second cycle in the communal bank, and they tell us that the previous loan helped them a lot. This is why there are more people who joined in this cycle hoping to have success with the loans. The majority of the group were able to improve their businesses and their lives, since with the earnings they were able to make improvements to their homes as well as helping their children's educations. They engage in various activities such as business, services, and food sales, among others.\r\n\r\nIn this place we meet Mariuxi, 23 years old. She is single and lives with her parents and various younger siblings.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working young woman who works in business in order to earn something on her own and to be able to help her parents with the household expenses.  Monday through Saturday she works in a store in the center of the city where they sell shoes. In her free time, she also sells shoes and sandals through a catalogue, from which she earns something in addition to what she earns at her job. She makes these sales at night and on the weekends.

","en":"The following group is called \"La Carrera.\" The members belong to the community of Dotegiare, which is located in the municipality of San Felipe del Progreso. The members of this group decided to give their group this name since to them it represents a race with life. They believe that life is like a race which always has to be won, and this is the base of their constant effort. This is a characteristic Mazahua community with very hard-working people with knowledge of Mazahua handcrafts and pride in their roots. Even though it is a small community, the people are very hardworking. This group decided to unite to be able to undertake productive activities.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members and their respective business activities are the following:\r\n1.- Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela B. (buy soft drinks and sweets to sell)\r\n2.- Mar\u00eda Bonifacia G. (buy napkins, tablecloths, and thread, to embroider and sell)\r\n3.- Victoria S.

She is the representative of this group and was married 15 years ago to Se\u00f1or Doroteo. Together they have 3 children, ages 15, 11, and 9, who are now in school. Se\u00f1ora Victoria is a client of FRAC and is very responsible and optimistic. She is applying for this loan because her work is selling fruits and vegetables. On this occasion she will buy red tomatoes, green tomatoes, chiles, onions, potatoes, nopal (cactus), bananas, and mangoes. She buys her fruit every 8 days in a town called Atlacomulco, and she takes it to her house where she sells it, or she goes out to offer it door to door. She had the idea to begin this business to help with the school expenses and support of her children, since for the moment her husband is not with her. She has two years of experience in this business, and she comments that it has gone very well for her, and the only problem that she has had in developing her business is an illness in her feet that makes her very tired when she walks around to offer her fruits and vegetables. She says that the loan will help her a lot since she will invest it and get earnings that will help her quite a bit with her expenses. In the future Se\u00f1ora Victoria would like to buy a means of transportation which will make transport of her products easier and won't cause soreness in her feet.

called Huamuchi is made up of ten humble and hard-working indigenous women originating from Pinotepa Nacional Oaxaca, where the people are hard-working.  One of the members is Carmen, a humble and hardworking woman who is 58 years old and who has made a living selling bread for a year.  \r\n\r\nCarmen Cleof\u00e1s tells us that she has two employees who make the bread and she just buys the ingredients, since she is ill and gets injured when she gets close to the heat of the oven.  But she is proud of her employees because they complete the orders on time and avoid disappointing her customers.\r\n\r\nCarmen Cleof\u00e1s is happily married to Pablo, who is 53 years old.  She says she is happy that her husband treats her well in spite of the fact that he is younger than she is.  Dona Carmen, as she is better known to her friends\/fellow group members, tells us that she names her bread the following:\r\n\"panquesitos\", \"rosquitas\", \"gringos\", \"muelas\", \"gusano\", \"donas\", \"petatitos\", \"enpanochadas\", \"papayo\" and \"costra\", and her best-selling bread is \"petatitos\".  Carmen is happy with her business as it allows for a good income and also her customers really like her bread.\r\n\r\nShe has three children: Pedro Paulo, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel y Emili, who help increase her business and she is happy with the extra income.\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more ingredients for making bread, such as:  yeast, Royal brand baking powder, sugar, flour, margarine, eggs and butter.\r\n\r\nCarmen tells us that she is very happy with the support that the foundation has given her and her fellow members so that they can change their lives.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan.

She was able to finish high school, paying for it with money that she earned working as a helper to her aunt, who is a seamstress. She is single and does not have any children. When she was in high school her mother passed away and her father decided not to continue helping her pay for her studies. The only support she had while studying came from her aunts and uncles. Later on she decided to travel to where one of her uncles lives in Brazil, to stop studying to be able to continue working as a seamstress and in this way earn an income. She has since returned from Brazil and now lives with her aunt and uncle, to whom she pays rent. Since she has experience in the work of a seamstress, she is partnering with her aunt to open a business in Cochabamba. Amanda is requesting the loan to buy sewing machines, so that she has her own equipment. This will allow her to have improved income and she is considering continuing to study later on down the road.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1066627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing machines.

She is very grateful for the support because in this way she can improve her store and grow as a successful businesswoman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1066637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a refrigerator and grocery supplies (rice, tuna, coffee, beverages, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-19T04:01:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-19T04:01:06Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kathia Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":139.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":174.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":186.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":195.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":137.36,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":141.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091277},{"amount":54.24,"local_amount":139.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":144.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222335},{"amount":115.34,"local_amount":297.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":306.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298405},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":156.01,"processed_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":160.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108790},{"amount":63.25,"local_amount":163.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315344964},{"amount":64.98,"local_amount":167.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954188},{"amount":67.8,"local_amount":174.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":180.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088617},{"amount":69.85,"local_amount":180.24,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":185.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478224},{"amount":72.4,"local_amount":186.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":192.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347030920},{"amount":75.61,"local_amount":195.12,"processed_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775451},{"amount":77.84,"local_amount":200.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":206.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482281}],"funded_date":"2012-05-18T22:39:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":414697,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Erlinda, 53, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

He goes to the main town every 8 days to get merchandise for his store which is located in his house.\r\n\r\nAgust\u00edn says:  \u201cThere are many goals.  One of them is to become a wholesale or half-wholesale firm in my region.  I want to supply nearby stores.\u201d Agust\u00edn is very enthusiastic and all he needs is one more push for his business.  A loan will help him improve his general store and his life expectations.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1058278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy eggs, sugar, soap, oil, milk, etc. by the case to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-19T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-19T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Adilene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Abigail","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5011.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5357.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5551.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5908.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6148.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6469.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6842.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7162.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7548.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":423.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":485.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":511.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":540.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":565.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":596.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":411752,"name":"La Roca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Roca lo conforman cuatro mujeres trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas  es Elba de 25 a\u00f1os quien vende ropa desde hace 5 a\u00f1os negocio que inicio con unas cuantas ropas y poco a poco fue creciendo.

Her husband and business partner is Cyril. She is the mother of two children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nHilda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 39,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHilda hopes her business will grow in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1070131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-19T04:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-19T04:20:09Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":385.42,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":16453.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095628},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":4875,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4936.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359238},{"amount":192.71,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8226.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303055},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3290.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355813},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6581.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308113957}],"funded_date":"2012-05-19T04:12:09Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":410514,"name":"Ni\u00f1a","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni\u00f1a works hard to support her 2 children.

She is married to Pepito, her business partner. She is a mother of two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n                            \r\nSalvacion operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She sells meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSalvacion hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

For this reason, he decided to start a new business beyond his job. It will be a small auto repair service with garage capacity for five cars. He said that each car will pay him USD 5-10 in a day. It is quite enough for him and his family currently. Now he needs a loan to purchase the building materials to build his workshop for the new business. In addition, he very much believes in his business plan.

Her situation during that time was difficult, but since she joined ASKI she has been eager to obtain success in life. As the days passed by, she became involved in the hog-raising business. In the hog business, her income increased, and this enabled her to start a sewing business. Leonila couldn't really explain what she felt at that time because, after the suffering she had undergone, the sun was still shining and she was achieving success in life.\n\nAt this time, Leonila runs her sewing business. At her age--64 years old--she is still able to sew different kinds of curtains, pants, pillowcases, blouses, and short pants. She really enjoys running her business because she is able to earn approximately 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). This is really a big blessing to her because she can cover all her household expenses and provide feed for her hogs. As a responsible borrower, Leonila has maintained a good track record and is now asking for a bigger loan of 30,000 PHP so she can buy stock garments, thread, and other materials needed in her sewing business.

She raises chickens and grows vegetables and fruit for sale. Earlier Tsoghik also raised pigs, but due to last year's pig disease in the Syunik region, she does not have any pigs left. Tsoghik sells the resulting products - eggs, vegetables and fruits -  in Kapan and Kajaran. \r\n\r\nTsoghik is 45 years old. She lives in Kapan. Tsoghik is married and has three children: Two daughters and one son. The daughters are already married and live separately from their parents, and the son currently lives in Russia. Tsoghik's husband works as a driver in one of Kapan's organizations and at the same time helps his wife with the farming, thanks to which they support the family. \r\n\r\nTsoghik wants to resume the raising of pigs, since it is very profitable. For this, Tsoghik needs a loan in the sum of 550,000 dram, which she will spend on buying some piglets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1072940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

This institute was founded in 1993. Teachers of the institute have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan. They requested a loan of 16,800,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group.

He lives in a small village of Zestaponi District with his family: his two sons (21 and 15 years old), his daughter-in-law and his one-year-old granddaughter. David\u2019s wife is an emigrant; she works abroad and assists her family financially. \r\n\r\nDavid earns a living through agricultural business. They have a milk cow and 200 nut trees. Dairy products are mainly consumed by the family; a small surplus and the nut harvest are sold in the Zestaponi District by David. Total average monthly income of the family from the above-mentioned activities is 150 Laris. David\u2019s wife sends them money monthly, but still, according to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDavid requested credit for the start up of a small poultry farm. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with easy conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\n With the received credit David will purchase chickens and place them in the old hen-house, located in the family yard. Also, part of the credit will be used for purchasing feed for the chickens.  He will grow chickens and start selling them in 3-4 months. Also, David will sell eggs as well. According to his estimations, the monthly income of the family will increase by 300 \u2013 350 Laris. That will mean a 100 \u2013 133% increase. The family will be able to improve their living conditions. In addition to the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, for further expansion of their new business.

In order to continue developing her business, Altynai has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional dairy cows.

In 2011, while looking for a source of income for her family, Mairamkan launched her own retail business with an initial investment of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Mairamkan was able to grow her business so that it currently earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, the assortment of goods in the store is not very wide, and so Mairamkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to expand the range of products for sale.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business. Mireya sells ice cream, juices, grocery products and underwear, all from her house and in the local school. She will use her loan to increase her inventory. She will use the profits to save.\r\n\r\nMireya says that her most difficult challenge is to have Dominican permission to live and to have her own house.

She makes a living by caring for children.  She does this for about 5 hours a day, mostly with children whose parents have to work, and they don't have anyone who can care for their little ones.  She believes that her business is going well because she is very loving with the children and because they are like delicate and fragile little people.

years old, married and raised four children. To provide a source of income for her family, she became involved in selling vegetables in 1995.  The business, started with an initial sum of 200 som (KGS), now yields about 20,000 som (KGS) per month, thanks to Sveta's persistence and hard work.  Today, the selection of products is limited, and this is why Sveta requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.
