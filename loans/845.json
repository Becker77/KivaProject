married.  As a source of income for her family, Jamalbu started a field crop farming and animal husbandry business in 1985.

He says he gets immense satisfaction knowing that the money transfer services he provides make people\u2019s lives easier.\r\n\r\nMaurice\u2019s small shop is located in Kamwala, one of the busiest markets in Lusaka. This means that he has a lot of customers coming to his shop. Sadly, due to a very low working capital, he cannot serve them all. He says this is a particularly big problem in the afternoons, as by that time of the day most of his money has run out and the banks are closed. This limits the number of customers he can serve in a day to a mere 10-20, when, if he had more money, he would be able to serve more than 50 customers.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets the Kiva loan, he will use the money to increase his working capital so that he can serve more customers and make more profits. In the future, Maurice plans to open another shop to increase his profits so that he can take care of his growing family and send his daughter to college.

For the last 10 years, she has worked as a seller. She sells fish, and in the evenings she sells pastries. She chose this activity as it was recommended by her mother.

Six months ago she was informed about the micro-loans that IMF-Hekima grants and thus she was given her first loan of US$50 in order to begin her business. The profits she makes from her activity are used for her savings, to buy food and to help out with her children's schooling. Meanwhile, she has been granted a second loan. During this period, the customer has seen her business prosper and so she has decided to increase her loan for this new cycle. This new loan will enable her to get fresh supplies: three sacks of live embers and one sack of cassava flour. For the future she would like to see her children grow up buy a piece of land.

For several years, Eugenia has worked for a business, but her salary isn't sufficient to invest in all the construction materials at one time.  With the previous loan, she was able to buy gravel and sand.  Now she needs to purchase iron, cement, blocks, and other materials to begin construction, but she doesn't have the economic resources necessary for the investment.  She would like the loan to purchase the construction materials.  She is grateful for the trust and confidence offered to her so that she can improve her quality of life and complete her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1067789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-04-20T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-20T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.47,"local_amount":1488.82,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1547.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283047354},{"amount":53.09,"local_amount":1189.22,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1236.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286782749},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":1198.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294510123},{"amount":55.28,"local_amount":1238.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1287.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301834112},{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":1269.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308339266},{"amount":339.97,"local_amount":7615.17,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7916.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315308153}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T23:55:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T10:56:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":415244,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita is patiently selling vegetables through a door-to-door offering of her products.

Amongst other challenges, she also has had difficulties in the raising capital to start up a business of her own \n\nWith this loan, she plans to buy pig feed for retail around her community, fertilizer  to increase  her farm produced and  piglets which will also  buy some of the pig feed to feed  her own piglets .Part of the money will be used to transport  the feed from the Bamenda Central town to her quarter Ntsualam  where her feed store is located. She thinks her business will succeed because in the area where she stays, there is  no pig feed stores or any animal feed store but most people rear animals especially pigs.  She also says that she will use the pig dung as manure for her farm which will also go a long way to increased yield and food in her commuinty.\n\nThis activity will help her community in that other women in her area will be able to get manure from her pig farm and people in her community will be able to buy their pig feed by their door steps thus reducing the cost of transportation.\n\nShe will use a part of her profit to pay tuition fees for her children, provide food for her family and also cater for their health. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1067389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married to a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for five years. He would like to get this loan to buy fertilizer, and support labor costs to get the best harvest during rice production. With the profits, Etienne plans to expand the area he is using in order to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Three of them still live at home and two attend university.  The youngest is in school.  Her husband is a fisherman, but he\u2019s ill and not currently working. \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to earn some money on her own and help her husband with the household expenses, she sells all types of clothing door to door and also out of her home, where she has some display cases where she can offer her products.  She goes out to sell four days a week and on the weekends she sells from her stall where the tourists visit.  She sells for cash or offers credit to her best customers and collects every week.  She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil based on what she needs.  She\u2019s been doing this for three years and things are going well.

She loves him greatly and gives her all daily with the goal of being able to buy him the clothes and food he needs to be in good health.\r\n\r\nJenny works every day, and on some occasions she doesn't spend much time with her young son.  For this reason, she enjoys being able to take him to the park and being able to spend some time with him, as in this way he feels that Jenny is always focused on him.\r\n\r\nJenny very much enjoys Peruvian food, and tells us that one of the dishes that really fascinates her is \"Rice with Turkey and Carapulcra\" [Carapulcra is a traditional Peruvian dish].  With the support of her parents, Jenny has been able to complete high-school, but on account of her low income, she has not been able to study at university, where she would have studied Law.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this situation, she decided to never see herself as defeated, and for this reason she decided to start her own business selling hamburgers and \"salchipollo\" [french fries and chicken].  She works from 6 in the evening until 11 at night, depending primarily on the quantity of customers who buy from her each day.\r\n\r\nShe thinks that her business will be successful, because she always strives to give good service to her customers and tries to serve them as quickly as possible so they wind up happy with the service she provides.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is being provided support so that she can purchase supplies (potatoes, tomatoes, bags, meat, sausages, among other items) for her hamburgers and salchipollo.  This will allow her to save some money to purchase the products that she needs in bulk.  She is sure that in this way she will improve her income, and will be able to provide her customers with better products.  In this way she will be able to purchase the kiosk that she wants so much one step at a time, allowing her to set up a a small restaurant which will increase her income, and thus build her

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to increase output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is a very kind and responsible woman. She raises fruits and vegetables in her garden and has been doing so for the last 3 years. She is a very experienced farmer and has deep knowledge of the land and how to operate it. A poor financial situation and unemployment have pushed her to start her business. \r\n\r\nXayala usually raises seasonal fruits and vegetables and sells them for a profitable price in the central bazaar. Fresh fruits and vegetables are very popular and are in high demand because people prefer to eat them every day and consider them very healthy. Also, one of the favorite national dishes is dolma, which is made of fresh eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes. Fresh juices are most likely made from fresh fruits. Xayala's monthly income from this business is 250 AZN. This is the only source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nNow Xayala would like to invest more capital into her business and purchase seeds and fertilizers. For this purpose, she has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN. This is the only source of income for her family and she hopes this loan will improve the lives of her family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1072032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agjabadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-04-20T22:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-20T22:00:10Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xayala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T07:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276811846},{"amount":103.7,"local_amount":81.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T07:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":81.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283775530},{"amount":106.82,"local_amount":83.78,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T07:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286800028},{"amount":105.44,"local_amount":82.7,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-24T08:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278706},{"amount":98.97,"local_amount":77.62,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":77.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331570},{"amount":109.41,"local_amount":85.81,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308088530},{"amount":104.33,"local_amount":81.83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":81.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315322801},{"amount":115.05,"local_amount":90.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":90.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322931546},{"amount":106.24,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331064389},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339453175},{"amount":212.54,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":166.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347006191}],"funded_date":"2012-04-21T19:23:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:34:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":415420,"name":"Cicilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cicilia is 51 years old and is from Nakuru.

After getting married, she became involved in animal husbandry in 1978, starting with two dairy cows given to her as wedding gifts by her parents.

In order to further develop her business, Salamat requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.

He is married to a trader, and has three children, ages 35, 27 and 15 years old. He has two additional dependents. Five years ago, Ibrahim established his bread baking and provision shop. He started the business because he did not have the opportunity to go to school, so he decided to engage himself in doing business. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le3, 000,000.

","en":"Aliya is 47 years old. She is a widow and lives with her son. As a source of income for her family, in 2010 Aliya began raising livestock.

In 2004, he established his provisions business. He began his business just after he completed his sixth form. He decided to go into business as a career and not to further his education as he saw it as a long-term investment and he needed the quickest way of earning money. Therefore, Alhaji Lamin decided to go into business with a small amount of income which he has expanded to this level.
