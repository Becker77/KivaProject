She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLoida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoida dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is a widow and a mother to her two children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nVirginia maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products of popular brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Virginia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 5,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 43,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to be more successful in her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is Blandina, forty-six, resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Renerio, her business partner, and she is a mother of two children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nBlandina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBlandina hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business; she also hopes that they serve the lord. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1072730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She feeds them and fattens them up and when they reach adequate size and weight she sell them to people who come to the zone.\r\n\r\nAurora asked for a 1000 sol loan to buy more animals to increase her business to earn higher profits which will help her for her youngest daughter\u2019s treatment.  Aurora has good references in the zone where she lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1068962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-04-21T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-21T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":89.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.96,"local_amount":69.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":74.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332857},{"amount":28.48,"local_amount":71.2,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423626},{"amount":29.8,"local_amount":74.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":79.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317038},{"amount":29.72,"local_amount":74.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":79.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373871},{"amount":32.02,"local_amount":80.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":85.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385119},{"amount":32.74,"local_amount":81.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368712},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977765},{"amount":35.08,"local_amount":87.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":93.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114976},{"amount":35.86,"local_amount":89.65,"processed_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":95.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506651},{"amount":115,"local_amount":287.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":306.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058614}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T07:11:15Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":415762,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is a married woman with three children, one of whom is in school.

Almendros and it\u2019s composed of nine hardworking, humble people who are proud to be part of the Fundaci\u00f3n and of their location.  The members of this group are from the location of Tututepec which has a museum called Yuku Saa which in the Mixteco language means \u201chill of the bird.\u201d The town is better known as Tutu.  It\u2019s on a high hill and when you arrive at the community you come upon a beautiful white sigh on the top of the hill that says \u201cViva Cristo Rey.\u201d   The sign was made by the people in the community thanking God for their location and their families.  There are many lemon, papaya and chili fields and there\u2019s a dam called \u201cPresa de R\u00edo Verde\u201d and an irrigation system.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Catalina, 29.  She\u2019s noted for being a cheerful, hardworking woman.  She has been selling hand-made tortillas for five years.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata, as she\u2019s better known by her fellow group members, has two children she loves very much.  Her children are called Emmanuel who is nine and Josu\u00e9 who is five years old.  She feels very happy for all the support from the Fundaci\u00f3n so that she can continue in business since she\u2019s a single mother and has to work twice as hard to give her children a better life.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata tells us that she used to work in a home cooking and doing laundry but thanks to support from the Fundaci\u00f3n she now has her small business and is able to offer her children a better life and spend more time with them.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata asked for the loan to buy more corn, logs and lime powder to make tortillas.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cata tells us that she rises at three in the morning to wash her corn and go to the mill.  She returns from the mill, lights her griddle and makes breakfast for her children.

The business will help her support her family since she lives with her partner and they have a son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the training in health and finances.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1069450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-04-21T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-21T22:30:04Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mmonica Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casimira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22222.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1083.35,"local_amount":7407.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7431.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243436},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":3703.75,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3715.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516304},{"amount":541.68,"local_amount":3703.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3715.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441239},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":3703.75,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3715.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495177},{"amount":541.63,"local_amount":3703.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3715.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260727}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T19:01:50Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":415818,"name":"Nusrat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nusrat is 43 years old, married, and raising four children.

She says that things are going well for her since she has been able to obtain income for her household with the loan.\r\n\r\nShe began this economic activity since she also wants to contribute to the household earnings so that her family isn't lacking anything that's most necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat she would like is for this small economic activity to continue moving forward until it can support her children's' education so that they can also get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:\r\n\r\nFlavia, who will invest the loan in the purchase and sale of pigs to sell by the kilo; and Soraida, who will invest it in the purchase and sale of jewelry."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1066584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy ranch chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soraida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656844},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317520},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418905},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6076.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568481}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T16:42:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":415825,"name":"Hanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanh is requesting a new loan to buy more food to sell from her stall.

His near-term goal is to continue working in order to see his business grow, and also to keep educating his children so that they can study to be professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1068799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy corn, beans, rice and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403733},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428680},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613391},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452868},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448915},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":166.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443786}],"funded_date":"2012-05-21T18:20:46Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":415844,"name":"Lowotha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lowotha, 25 years old, is married to Mary and they are blessed with two children.

their quality of life. The members of this group are from a small town called Tetepelcingo where there are many banana plants and green trees.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving to the community there is a river called R\u00edo Grande where they go to bathe and wash their clothing. The river has very little water.\r\n\r\nIn the locality the majority of the people make a living making tapestries as it's one of the things they like the most and that their ancestors taught them.\r\n\r\nIn the locality of Tetepelcingo they have a celebration. On the 6th and 7th of May they celebrate the town's holiday. There are rides, little bulls, and castles. All the residents go out to the park to have fun and the kids have fun going on the rides.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Teresa who's thirty-four years old. Mrs. Teresa has made a living making tapestries and tablecloths for ten years.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that what she likes most about her business is giving her customers good service since they ask for tapestries for baptisms and girls' fifteenth birthdays.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere, as the members of her group know her, tells us that it was her mom who taught her how to make tapestries and combine colors to look beautiful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere is happily married to Elpidio who's thirty-six years old and with whom she has four children: Julio David who's sixteen years old, Litzi who's eleven years old, Cristian who's eight years old, and Enrique who's six years old.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that at times she doesn't have thread with which to work and that it makes her sad as she so enjoys her work. She feels bad when she doesn't have the resources to do what she most likes which is to makes her tapestries and tablecloths.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tere tells us that she is very happy with her business and that it provides her with good earnings. In this way she can give a better life to her children.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more material to make tapestries like: white thread, silk thread, worsted thread.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is very happy with the foundation for supporting her so that her business grows and that in this way she can improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nIn\u00e9s, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nArtemio, who makes a living selling chiles and seeds.\r\nMaricela, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nA\u00edda, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nReina, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nMaria Susana, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nRufina, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nDemetria, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\nPetrona, who makes a living selling embroidery.\r\n\r\nThey are thankful to the foundation for helping people from small towns who have an engrained desire to better themselves as their town is very small and poor, but in Tetepelcingo there are hardworking people and many children that need a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1066725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy material to make tapestries and tablecloths.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"tetepelcingo,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Artemio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5875},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":5875,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5912.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656845},{"amount":1350,"local_amount":17625,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":17738.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317522},{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418907},{"amount":900,"local_amount":11750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11825.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568483}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T17:22:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":415848,"name":"Winnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Winnie is a 30-year-old salon owner in Mombasa.

The group decided on this name because it's where group member Adela lives. She is a 71-year-old widow who lives at home by herself, although her children live close by. Adela tells us that for the past 15 years she has made a living raising animals, but at this time she is requesting the loan to stock her general store so she can buy all the products it has been lacking. She plans to purchase detergents, canned goods, milk, cheese, sugar, bread, beverages and other items. She has had her store for 13 years, and it is located in front of a cemetery. The challenges she faces is that there is a lot of competition in the surrounding area and that makes it difficult to earn good profits, but she does not give up because things always end up well. One of Adela's goals is to expand her store since it is very tight and isn't very appealing. Between laughs, Adela says \"My small store needs a good makeover so it become presentable.\" Adela and the rest of the group is very grateful for the loan authorized by Kiva partner FRAC because a lot of times they don't have enough to invest in their activities but they will benefit a lot from this loan and be able to buy what they need. Efren plans to invest in used car parts; Miguel plans to buy cows, corn and feed; and Fernando plans to purchase sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7025,"image":{"id":1063614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase detergents, canned goods, milk, cheese, sugar, bread, beverages, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Fresno Nichi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":7025,"lender_count":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efren ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":92000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":7025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13567.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":14336.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":14900.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15688.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16362.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17144}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1036.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1094.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1137.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1197.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1249.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1309.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2130.75,"local_amount":27904.46,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":27996.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317525},{"amount":1137.81,"local_amount":14900.82,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":14949.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418910},{"amount":1197.95,"local_amount":15688.51,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15740.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568486},{"amount":1249.4,"local_amount":16362.21,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-26T08:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16416.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399800},{"amount":1309.09,"local_amount":17144,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":17200.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407537}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T00:10:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":415878,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora is 41 years old and married with three children.

He is single. He manages his household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPeter operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nPeter hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his adopted children will be able to have a good future through all his hard work in his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

More recently she was informed about the microloans granted by IMF Hekima and so she took advantage of her first loan of USD 50 to strengthen her business. The profits from her business are used to build up her savings, for food and to help out with her children's schooling. Meanwhile, she has been granted her third loan.

Gulsana was born in a large shepherd family with 7 children. After school she got married to a man from the same village and in the period 1991 to 1997 she gave birth to four children. During this time she was a housewife, and her husband was engaged in agriculture. \r\n\r\nBecause the life in the village became very hard, Gulsana and her husband moved to the city of Bishkek in 2000, where her husband found work as a loader at the market \"Dordoi\", in order to pay for the family's food and rent. In the period 2001-2011 Gulsana's husband for periods went to Russia as a migrant worker, and was able to buy a house in the village of Sosnovka. During this time the family expanded with four more children. In 2011, Gulsana was awarded the honorary title \"Mother Heroine\".\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Gulsana and her husband purchased a \"container\" (point of sales) at the market in the city of Kara-Balta (Chuysky province, Javil district) and started selling food products. Currently Gulsana and her husband are selling food products at their own point of sales. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulsana turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for broadening the assortment of goods. Gulsana plans to invest the income from the loan in developing her business, in order to have an opportunity to give all her children education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1076546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

The members are from Pinotepa Nacional, an area where people dance the Chilenas and where they speak Mixtec.\r\nOne of the members of the group is Librada Miverda, thirty-six, a cheerful and chatty woman.  Her friends call her Mine and she has sold Herbalife products for the past three years.\r\nShe has a small stand near the hospital where she sells her products and also makes malted milkshakes, teas and yogurt.  Mine tells us that what she likes most about her business is helping her customers have a better quality of life and good health.\r\nShe is happily married to Javier, thirty-six, and they have two children, Ada Lizabeth, thirteen, and Iitzad Iizbeth, sixteen.  They are the reason she wants to get ahead and improve their quality of life.  Mine is requesting the loan to buy more Herbalife products to sell wholesale and retail since her business is giving her good earnings.  That way she can have more income to help her children and provide them with a better education.  One of the things that makes her sad is that some of the people are suspicious of what she sells as if the products were bad for their health. She also tells us that she delivers her merchandise to customers\u2019 homes and that she makes her malted milk shakes with oatmeal, natural Herbalife flavoring and ice.\r\nShe blends all in the blender, adds ice, blends again, and serves it with cinnamon for their enjoyment. Ones of the nice things about Mine is that she cares about people\u2018s health, both thin and heavy, so that their bodies feel well.  Mine thanks the Foundation because with their assistance, her business grows every day and she can help people eat nutritiously.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nRosa Elia- who sells

Tulips of Tututepec) comunal bank is comprised of ten hard-working and humble women who devote themselves to different business activities.  They are from a small town called Tututepec, which is rich in culture and traditions.  One of their dances is the Fandango de Varitas where the music is played with the violin, guitar, a singer, a \u201ccaj\u00f3n\u201d (a box-shaped percussion instrument played by slapping the front face with the hands), and the \u201ccharrasca\u201d (percussive derivative of African instrument that makes a guttural sound).\r\n\r\nThe songs that they play are \u201cLa Garza\u201d (The Heron) and \u201cLa Pescadora y La Indita\u201d (The Fisherman and the Little Indigenious Lady).  The boys step aside and the girls dance in the streets of the community with scarves.  The people of \u201ctutu\u201d (what they call Tututepec) are proud of their community, their culture, and their traditions.  The dances gladden the heart, and the children have fun.\r\n\r\nMaria, better known as Mari, is one of the members of this group.  She is a happy and hard-working woman.  Mari has been making tortillas by hand for ten years.  She tells us that she feels proud of her work.  This is because she does it with love, and it gives her good earnings.  She is also proud of the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping good and hard-working people.\r\n\r\nMari tells us that she also sells typical Mexican snacks like fried tacos, shredded pork tostadas, \u201csopes\u201d(fried tortilla topped with refried beans, onion and hot sauce), and quesadillas.

Butterflies).  It is made up of thirteen indigenous women who want to improve their social condition.  They speak Mixtec and wear traditional skirts and shawls. \r\nThe members of this group are natives of a town called Santa Catarina Mechoacan.  It is a small town with a lot of green trees.  There is a very beautiful river, as you enter the community.\r\nThe name of the town, Santa Catarina Mechoacan, means \"fishing town\" in Mixtec.  The members of the communal bank tell us that a long time ago the river was full of fish, and the people from the community would fish very early in the morning. \r\nOne of the members of the communal bank is Se\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas.  She is fifty-six years old and is a hardworking indigenous woman.  She is a little shy but very friendly.  She earns a living making and selling bread. \r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas tells us that she has been selling bread for twenty years.  What she likes best about her business is making the bread, which she does with love.\r\nShe makes her bread in an earthen oven (which is in the background of the above photo).  She sells the bread in the Ri\u00f3 Grande community every third day.  What she doesn't like is that she gets overheated making the bread and that her back aches, as she carries the tray of bread on her back as she sells it door to door.  Sometimes, though, she takes orders, and she always tries to deliver on time.\r\nOne of Se\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas's dreams and goals is to modernize her equipment so that she doesn't get so overheated or tired.  She does get a little tired, because of her age. \r\nOne of her challenges is exapnding her business.  She wants to have employees make the bread and deliver it to more communities besides Ri\u00f3 Grande.\r\nShe also tells us that she will use the loan to purchase more bread-making ingredients, like: yeast, milk, baking powder, sugar, butter and lard.\r\nThe loan will also help her improve her house, since her earnings have enabled her to fix it up, to make it more resistant.\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maria de Jes\u00fas is very grateful to the Foundation for the help they have given her to make her life better and meet her goals and dreams.\r\nThe other members of the communal bank are:\r\nZoila- who makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMargarita Rogelia- makes her living selling bread.\r\nLucina- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMaria- makes her living offering carpentry services.\r\nIn\u00e9s Aurelia- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nCandelaria- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nAmalia- makes her living selling bread.\r\nBeatriz- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMicaela- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nJosefa- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nIsabel- makes her living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMargarita- makes

He is a determined person and is well-known in the community.  Since he was a boy, he dreamed about having his own business.  Miguel makes a living growing coffee, and 6 years ago, he started his own small grocery store.  He has stocked it little by little.  He works with his wife, and they have a schedule from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.  One of the disadvantages is that in some months, the sales are lower, but with good administration of the business, Miguel and his wife have been able to get ahead.  Their family has scarce economic resources, so they make the most of each opportunity that presents inself.  The loan that he is requesting is to stock his grocery store with products like:  rice, flour, eggs, sugar, butter, soap, etc.  With the help of this loan, Miguel will be able to keep his business well-stocked and help support his family.  One of his goals is to grow his business.  This is Miguel's third loan with FAMA, and he has paid off his previous loans on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1068712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Trojes, El Paraiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Alexis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candida Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milton Evelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":43000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":568.75,"local_amount":10750,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10837.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476846},{"amount":284.38,"local_amount":5375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5418.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850569},{"amount":284.37,"local_amount":5375,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5418.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551440},{"amount":284.38,"local_amount":5375,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5418.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377714},{"amount":284.37,"local_amount":5375,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5418.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387860},{"amount":552.7,"local_amount":10446.59,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10531.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372383},{"amount":16.05,"local_amount":303.41,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":305.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331965096}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T13:51:34Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:31:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":414076,"name":"Jenniffer Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jenniffer es una madre soltera de 24 a\u00f1os, sus dos hijos tienen 1 y 3 a\u00f1os y juntos viven en la parroquia \"R\u00edo Verde\" en \"Santo Domingo\" que es un cant\u00f3n de la provincia de \"Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas\" el cual es uno de los m\u00e1s densamente poblados del Ecuador.

She sells from her home, where she has a small, but well stocked stand.  Her customers find everything at her business, as she offers shrimp, lobster, crab, many kinds of fish, and conch, among other things.  Everything is of very good quality because she guarantees it and that's why her customers prefer her.  She has had her business for over 20 years and it's going very well for her.\r\n \r\nThis loan is to buy all kinds of seafood and to offer her customers the best.  She has been with her communal bank almost from its inception and she likes it because her fellow members are very close and reliable.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a huge cold store in downtown Portoviejo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1068726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy seafood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Sucre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T19:30:09Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1430,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":178.75,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":181.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646373},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":362.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321454},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":362.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209048},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":362.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335366},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":178.75,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":181.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391147}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T17:30:57Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":416167,"name":"Amadu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amadu sells fried yams, fish and chicken, which she has done for two years now.

She is 37 years old and the mother of two adorable children for whom she works very hard.  She puts in a lot of effort every day to get ahead on her own, since the father of her little ones left her a few years ago.  Her home is in the city of Pisco, which is known for having a hot, comfortable climate.  It is also very well known because it is the site of one of the country's most important tourist attractions, the Ballestas Islands and Paracas' El Candelabro.\r\n\r\nAt first she sold fruit for a living, but as time went on, her sales went down and one of her little ones got sick and she had to use the little money she had for working capital to take him to the doctor.  After that happened, she began to save and, with a lot of effort, Juana started her business selling chicken soup in her home.  She works about eight hours a day, especially at night, since there is a lot of business at that time.  She thinks her business is going well because her seasoning is very good and that's why her customers always come back.\r\n\r\nJuana is very thankful to Kiva's lenders, as it is thanks to the great help she has received from them that she will be able to buy ingredients to make her soups, such as bulk vegetables.  She will also be able to make improvements to her home, which will allow her to offer her children a better quality of life and keep struggling every day to make her biggest dream a reality: to have a big restaurant and to offer her children the best education.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1069623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1073620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Khokhana Dobato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947176},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296566},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286992338},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-23T08:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646223},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-04T08:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226897},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-23T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308259648},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489447},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-28T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094424},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200660},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170922},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913145}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T21:35:51Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":416272,"name":"Marlon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlon is 42 years old and lives in Macabayao, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

In the future, Meera plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1073613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Khokhana Dobato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947175},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7751.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296565},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-01T08:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226896},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-23T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308259647},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489446},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-28T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094423},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200659},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170921},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913144}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T21:26:59Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":414421,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Judith, tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en Tela Atl\u00e1ntida junto a su hija de 13 a\u00f1os de edad, su conyugue y su madre.\nElla es una mujer muy emprendedora, hace dos a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 su propio negocio de elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de comida, jugos y refrescos.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElena dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Before reaching the community, there is an arroyo (stream bed) called Tuzapa.  In San Franciso de Maguey, there are approximately two hundred homes amid the many green trees.  One of San Franciso de Maguey\u2019s traditions is the cowboy dance, celebrated on the Day of the Dead.   Men, both young and old, come out to dance in the streets of the community dressed in red suits and hats, and carrying canes. They dance to the music of wind instruments as the citizens accompany them, applauding each dance.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Liberaci\u00f3n Group is Gelacia, a cheerful, talkative, and fun lady.  Gelacia has been selling tortillas for eight years.  She tells us that she has a tortilla called La Nina.  She has two workers in the tortiller\u00eda (tortilla shop) who operate the machines and wash the nixtamal (cooked maize).  Gelacia also helps her employees by weighing the tortillas and selling them at the tortiller\u00eda while they go to the community suburbs by motor cycle to sell more tortillas.  She tells us that she is very happy with her work because it provides her with good profits that enable her to grow her business more and generate work.  What she dislikes about her business is that the tortiller\u00eda gets overheated and it\u2019s very hot.  As a result, she and her employees become very dehydrated.  \r\n\r\nShe is happily married to Pedro who is sixty-six years old.  They have seven children who are already married.  Gelicia tells us that she will use the loan to purchase more corn, lime, and tortilla wrapping paper and also to repair the tortilla machine.  She is very grateful to the foundation for helping working people who desire to improve their lives and their community.\r\n\r\nA list of the other members follows:\r\nJuana, who sells cold meats\r\nMaria, who sells cold meats\r\nCriselda, who sells meals\r\nEfr\u00e9n, who sells groceries\r\nHip\u00f3lita Cytlaly, who sells clothing\r\n\r\nThey thank the foundation for helping all the people who wish to see a better future and a better Mexico for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1066832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients for making tortillas.

has 4 children. Venera has raised livestock since 2001 as the sole source of income for her family.  Thanks to her tireless work she now owns a milk cow and calf. Being energetic and enterprising, Venera began operating a grocery stand which earns her a profit of 15,000 som (KGS) a month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Venera came to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 120,000 som (KGS) loan to buy additional livestock. She plans to invest the income earned from the loan into continued expansion of her herd.
