It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Roselle earns a profit by buying wholesale supplies and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. Roselle earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nRoselle is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add in her inventory and continue operating her store. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Roselle hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. Fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1073749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items and products for her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-22T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-22T23:40:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3205.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606787},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2564.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095658},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1923.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359267},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1923.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303082}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T13:20:28Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":414532,"name":"Mar\u00eda Reina De La Paz   (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Mar\u00eda Reina de la Paz est\u00e1 formado por 14 socias y 2 socios, quienes se caracterizan por ser personas amables, gentiles, trabajadoras, que luchan d\u00eda a d\u00eda para poder aportar a la econom\u00eda de sus hogares y as\u00ed brindarles un mejor futuro a sus familias.

She is married to Rodolfo, her business partner, and is the mother of three children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCelia hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

women, who wish to make their businesses grow and improve their lives.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are from Pinotepa Nacional in Oaxaca state, a land of hard-working people and progress; but also much hunger, as there are many poor people, although there are plenty who take more than their fair share.  \r\n\r\nIn Pinotepa the most popular dance is the Chilena. In Pinotepa there are small businesses and also many children playing in the park, and many women selling tamales in the streets of the community.\r\n\r\nOne of Pinotepa's traditions is the \"Fifth Friday\" holiday where there are a lot of fun and games in the streets for the children, and one can see the Pilgrimage, a play about the life of Jesus Christ. People go out to watch the youth who perform the play. For the people, that day is one of repentance and forgiveness, and a day to enjoy oneself and forgive others.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Maria Emiliana. She is 49, and known for being a friendly, hard-working woman, who is very proud of her roots and  her business.\r\n\r\nEmilia, as she is better known by her fellow group members, sells soft drinks and tamales. She has been selling soft drinks and tamales for 20 years. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about selling tamales is the preparation. Emilia tells us that the tamales are prepared in the following way: First, heat the banana leaves and clean them. Then prepare the chili, adding add half an onion, puya and gaguillo chilis, garlic; then grind them together. Then wash the chicken meat and put it, together with the prepared chili on a large platter. Prepare the dough adding lard. To make a tortilla out of the dough, you place the leaf down, and put a bit of the dough on top and flatten it. Add both the chili and the chicken. Fold the leaf into the shape of a tamale, and put all of this together on the fire. Wait for them to cook, take them out of the pot, and let people know you have tamales, so that your customers come and buy from you.\r\n\r\nEmiliana has six children: Maria de Jes\u00fas, Mois\u00e9s, Eleazar, Francisco, Angelo and Juan Jos\u00e9. They motivate her to keep going, as she really loves them and wants them to always count on her. Emiliana is happily married to Eleazar, 51, a friendly and hard-working man. \r\n\r\nEmiliana also tells us that she sells handmade tortillas, yet doesn't intend to return to the tortilla business: only when she has orders for them. She doesn't make tortillas every day, because making them is hard on the the lungs.\r\n\r\nEmiliana also sells food, chicken mole (chicken in a spicy sauce), chicken soup, fish soup, barbecued meat, and abobo de marrano (marinated pork).\r\n\r\nEmiliana requested the loan to buy more soft drinks and more ingredients for making tamales. She is very grateful to the Foundation for helping her earn her daily living.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Rocio, who sells candy; Elizabeth, who sells Mexican snack foods; Ignacia, who sells Mexican snack foods; Adela, who sells clothing; Adelaida, who sells clothing; and Maria de Jes\u00fas, who sells chickens.\r\n\r\nThey give thanks to the Foundation for helping them to appreciate things and benefit from life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1066805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soft drinks and ingredients for making tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-23T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-23T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Emiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5666.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656846},{"amount":718.75,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9443.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317523},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7555.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418908},{"amount":575,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7555.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568484}],"funded_date":"2012-04-23T20:21:49Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":414825,"name":"Sonrisas Frente Al Mar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco comunal se llama \u201cSonrisas Frente al Mar\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 18 emprendedores, quienes se dedican a diferentes rubros, entre los cuales se encuentran artesan\u00eda, preparaci\u00f3n de productos de reposter\u00eda, venta de abarrotes, entre otros.

\n\n","en":"Svetlana is 57 years old, has raised one daughter and takes care of three grandchildren. Svetlana was born in a simple family; her father and mother were teachers at the local school. After having finished school, Svetlana started medical studies in 1972, and got married in the same year. In 1973 Svetlana gave birth to her daughter, and 6 months after their daughter was born, Svetlana's husband left her for another woman. Being a strong woman, Svetlana succeeded in finishing medical school and got a job as a nurse. \n\nIn 1985 Svetlana started working as a nurse in a psycho-neurological home, an institution where she also works today. Her work experience in this institution is 27 years. After 10 years of devoted work, the administration gave Svetlana an apartment and a private agricultural property, where she started engaging in livestock breeding. \n\nThanks to her persistence, perseverance and her belief in herself, Svetlana managed to raise her daughter all by herself, give her an education and in 1990 happily marry her off. Currently the daughter and her husband are migrant workers in Russia. Svetlana is still engaged in livestock breeding, and she has one dairy cow, one bull and six sheep at her farm. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her farm, Svetlana turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock. Svetlana plans to invest the income from the loan in further expanding her farm, so that she has opportunity to help her daughter, so that she does not have to leave her children in the search of work.

She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza. This loan will allow her to keep investing in her business. In regards to the trainings given in the communal bank, she remarks that she has learned to distribute her income in a better way, which has helped her business. She also enjoys the meetings, since she shares with the other members who are very hardworking.  \r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a community in the south central area of Chile.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNilda operates a variety store with the help of a single employee. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go in order to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Rice and fuel are among the item she carries; these being basic necessities. \r\n\r\nShe is also a dealer of sawali, a native housing material made out of buho, a species of bamboo indigenous in the Philippines. The bamboo is split, the skin is separated from the body and dried in the sun. Then it is woven to make the sawali, a cheap but durable material for walls and partitions. Located along the national highway, Nilda\u2019s store gets a portion of its sales from commuters and passersby, but the mainstay of her business are the residents of the surrounding rural areas. She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNilda needs an additional PHP 15,000 for her business. The loan will be used to purchase additional products for her store. A portion of her loan is also used to finance the sawali makers from whom she gets her supply. It will allow her to continue and expand her operations. \r\n\r\nAs with all businesspersons, Nilda dreams of expanding and succeeding in her chosen business. Having no family of her own she vows to use the fruits of her enterprise to help others and to save for the future. She also aspires to know Jesus Christ more deeply. She relies on the guidance of her C.C.T. fellowship group in her walk with Christ.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 34 years old and a resident of Palawan, Philippines. She is married to Freddie, a self-employed furniture maker, and a mother to her three children. Two of them are in grade school with the youngest not yet of school age. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide an income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArlyn has been operating a variety store for the past 12 years in Palawan. Essentially, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails basic necessities, such as canned goods, beverages, toiletries and, in rural areas such as Busuanga, even rice and gasoline. Arlyn earns by buying in bulk, marking these up and selling by the piece. She nets around PHP 335 daily from the operation of her store and from selling sawali on the side.\r\n\r\nArlyn needs PHP 16,000 to add to her existing capital. She believes that this amount would help her sustain and expand her business. It would be used to boost the product inventory of her store. And it would also enable her to order more sawali from her suppliers to cope with the rising demand due to the upswing of construction in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nArlyn\u2019s 12 years in business is a testimony to her grit and determination to succeed. She has had her share of challenges. Chief among them are delayed payments from her customers. She has also learned the lesson that profit from business should be plowed back into the enterprise to make it viable and strong. This in turn will ultimately ensure her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nA firm believer that education is the path to a brighter tomorrow, Arlyn dreams of seeing all her three children finish college. An active C.C.T. partner, Arlyn meets with her co-fellowship members every Monday to give mutual support, pray for one another and study scriptures as well as to monitor the status of individual loans.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nVictoria dreams of growing her business in the coming years.

Her little one is 5 months old and she loves him dearly.  He gives her the strength she needs to make progress and he is her best source of motivation.  Ysabel tells us that whenever she is sad or worried for any reason, just seeing her baby's face makes her forget everything and she is able to draw on hidden reserves of strength so that she can keep going and keep making progress.  Isabel's home is located in the city of Chincha.  This city is known as the birthplace of some of Peru's sporting legends.  It is also well known because its residents have a great talent for preparing very flavorful food.  Like all good Peruvians, Isabel really enjoys Peruvian cuisine.  One of her favorite dishes is the delicious fried fish with beans.  Owing to her family's limited economic means, Isabel was only able to study up to the fifth year of her secondary education.  She would have liked to have studied Business Management.\r\n\r\nIsabel worked hard and managed to set up a business selling clothing.  She works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 15 customers a day.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is charming and kind to her customers.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help that they provide, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business.  In particular, she will buy clothing to sell in the run up to Mothers' Day.  This will enable her to improve her income and she will be able to continue working hard every day so that she can fulfill her biggest dream of owning her own

","en":"Habibullo is thirty-three, married, and has two children.  His primary line of work is mending old shoes.  Every day he gets to work early and starts receiving customers.  He is really good at stitching and repairing shoes, so he has a lot of steady clients.  His father is in the same line of work so he passed the business on to Habibullo.  Habibullo's job is his family's main source of income; his wife is a homemaker and raises their young children, and doesn't have an outside job.

She works all day every day, including week-ends and bank holidays. Her customer base is loyal and has been with her since she started her business. She buys her merchandise from several suppliers, depending on which offers the best prices. With this loan, she will buy merchandise to supply her stand. Lorena lives with her three children, aged 29, 27, and 20, who work and study. One of her personal dreams is to renovate her house and offer her grandchildren a better quality of life, particularly when it comes to education. She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity afforded her by Fondo Esperanza, since its support has been crucial for her business. She says that the communal bank group of which she is a member is very tightly knit. Thanks to the information imparted during meetings, she was able to learn new accounting and investing strategies for her business. San Bernardo is a town located 18 km to the south of Santiago's (the capital of Chile) main square in a straight line. It is known as the capital of folklore, since every year in January it hosts the International Folklore Festival, an event which showcases the country's roots and attracts musical ensembles from all over South America. The Traditional Artisans' Fair, also in January, draws Chilean and neighbouring countries' artisans to the town. In April, the town hosts the \"Abril cuecas Mil\" (\"A thousand cuecas in April\") festival, during which all the locals dance cuecas (a traditional Chilean dance).\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1070591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

This is because during the rainy season, there is less motorcycle transport. Joyce has therefore decided to stock up in preparation for this. Her main challenge is that by being employed full time, there is little time to supervise her other businesses.

Cows are never raised for beef but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

She has 23 years of hair styling experience and opened her business in 2005.\n\n\u201cBecoming an entrepreneur is something that I always wanted to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked in places where it\u2019s been a lot of chaos. When you get women together, you get a lot of opinions. I wanted to have my own place to give customer service my way. I listen to the customers and give them what they ask for.\u201d\n\nThis initiated Veronica\u2019s new loan with ACCION Texas Inc. She plans to use it to purchase items from Hawaii to resell within the shop, as requested by her clientele, and to improve its Hawaiian paradise feel. Veronica also plans to update her shop with new paint and repair minor problems.\n\nContinuing about her love for the industry, Veronica said, \u201cI like working with hair and am comfortable with making people feel good about themselves.\u201d She said,  \u201cIf your hair looks good, you feel good. It\u2019s gratifying to me to know I can do that.\u201d\n\nAt Hair in Paradise, Veronica employs two other people: one receptionist and one stylist. As her business grows, Veronica plans to hire more employees. \n\nVeronica said the loan will help her business grow and allow her salon \u201cto be more inviting to my customers and make them feel more relaxed.\u201d\n\nA returning ACCION client, Veronica said previous loans affected her business positively. \u201cACCION is a good company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe loan officers I worked with seemed interested in what I wanted to do. I felt comfortable with them.\u201d \n\nThose previous loans allowed her to make her salon more comfortable, have the necessities needed to build the shop and make it stronger. \n\nFind Veronica on
