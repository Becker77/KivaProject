They are fighters, hard workers, and thanks to their effort they have managed to get ahead with their families.\r\nThey live around the canton of Nabon, a place with cold weather, located in the southeast area of Azuay province. It is home to several spots which people can visit and enjoy nature in all its splendor. Its people work in agriculture, raising animals, and many go out to the city daily in order to perform different economic activities.\r\nSonia is one of the members of this group. She is 34 years old, married, and has conceived five children from her marriage, ages 13, 11, 9, 7, and two. Her oldest daughter is going to school, and her three middle children attend another little local school. Her husband works in construction as a mason.\r\nSonia is a home-maker and has also had a store for five months. She works there from Sunday to Sunday with no fixed schedule. She also raises sheep, pigs, guinea pigs, and chickens, and grows several products for home consumption. When there is a surplus, she sells it.\r\nThis is her fifth loan with the communal bank. She will use her new loan to invest in purchasing supplies for her store.\r\nHer goal is to give her children a better education so that they can better themselves and become good professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1071086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nab\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-23T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-23T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeth Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Nube","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Etelvina De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2640,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321467},{"amount":301.14,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":301.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209061},{"amount":582.19,"local_amount":580,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":582.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335379},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391160},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150166},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":220.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383326}],"funded_date":"2012-05-12T23:41:14Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":416913,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is the mother of 6 children, all of whom are grown.  But her 23-year old daughter lives with her, is always by her side and helps her with everything.  Ysabel has had difficult time throughout her life.  She was married at 16 and was widowed.  After a time, she married again, but her new partner left her.  She raised her children by herself and put forth a lot of effort to get them ahead.  Ysabel's 94-year old mother also lives with her.  Ysabel loves her very much and takes care of her.  In spite of her age, Ysabel's mother works in the fields.  She is an example that age is not an impediment to working and feeling useful.  Ysabel's home is in Imperial, a city known for its beautiful beaches, its warm climate, its agriculture and above all, the friendliness of its people.\r\n\r\nYsabel learned as a young girl helping her mother to \"earn her bread by the sweat of her brow.\"  Because of that, Ysabel made the decision to have a business selling flowers, which is her current work.  She was excited about it, since her mother taught her to arrange the flowers.  She has now been in the business 15 years.  Ysabel is very friendly with her customers, and that is why they seek her out and purchase her products.  Ysabel believes that that is why her business is going well for her.\r\n\r\nYsabel is quite grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help they have offered, she will be able to purchase more flowers for her business.  This is especially important because Mother's Day is approaching, and she always has orders to fill.  Now Ysabel will improve her income and be able to keep working toward making her greatest dream a reality, \"to have a big flower shop and to buy herself a car.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1070979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She makes a lot of garments there, both men's and women's, though she prefers making women's clothing. She works every day from 9am to 9pm and sometimes stays up all night if she has a lot of work. She delivers her orders at a store in the mall in Portoviejo. She has been doing this for more than 15 years and it's going well.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers and other sewing materials. This is her sixth cycle with the village bank and she likes it because of the benefits that the institution offers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a seamstress shop in the center of Portoviejo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":759436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, buttons, zippers and other sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-24T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-24T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Cupertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321473},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209067},{"amount":137.49,"local_amount":137.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":137.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335385},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391166},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150170},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383329}],"funded_date":"2012-04-27T23:46:49Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":416961,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 51 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She lives in a small village of Kvareli District with her family: her mother (retired), her elder brother and her 15-year-old niece who goes to school. At the moment Naili is the only income provider in the family. She works as a laborer in the village. Mainly Naili works on seasonal agricultural jobs. The total average monthly income of the family is 210 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nNaili used to run a family farming business. In particular, she used to grow melons on a family-owned plot of land. Last year, she had to stop this business because she didn\u2019t have financial resources for financing seasonal agricultural work. Now her loan request has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with easy conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Naili will cultivate the land and purchase melon seeds, as well as fertilizer.

She finances a group of small fishermen who go out to sea by providing food, fuel, ice and other items they need. Sometimes she may even advance cash to her suppliers. Once the boats come in, the catch is sorted, weighed and packed into ice boxes for shipment to Manila. Mary Jane and the fishermen then square their accounts and the cycle starts anew. Mary Jane ships around 12 50-kilo boxes of fish weekly. She earns about Php700 daily.\r\n\t\r\nMary Jane needs Php 40,000 as additional capital to be able to cope with the ebb and flow of the fish business. It will be used to purchase additional fish and ice as well as for operational expenses like the bills for shipping and wages for those who repack and handle the fish.\r\n\r\nOn the personal side, Mary Jane finds it hard to cope with some family problems. But it is her three children who give her the determination to succeed. She dreams that one day they will all graduate from college, surpassing her, for she only managed to finish her secondary studies. Mary Jane is an active community partner of C.C.T. She meets with her fellowship* group every Wednesday.\r\n\r\n*All C.C.T. community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nAnelito hopes to be able to expand soon. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and there he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1074839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Recuerdos (Memories), is made of five hard-working, friendly, and happy women.  All of the members of this group are natives of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  For them, their community means land of good and hard-working people.  One of the traditions of Pinotepa Nacional is the celebration of Day of the Dead and the Fiesta Quinto Viernes when the games arrive and many foreigners come to sell their crafts.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Maria, 58 years old, who is known for being a happy, humble, and very friendly woman.  Do\u00f1a Mari, as she is better known by her partners in the group, makes a living selling footwear from a catalog.  She sells footwear for boys, girls, men, and women.  She tells us that what she likes most about her business is going out and selling in the streets of her community so that she can get more profits.  What she doesn't like about her business is that sometimes her customers are slow to pay her, and this is where she loses customers and falls behind in ordering her goods.  \r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to have a small place where she can exhibit her goods and be able to meet her clients.  Do\u00f1a Mari tells us one of her challenges, which at times makes it difficult to continue with her business, is that sometimes she runs out of money for ordering more goods and her customers get upset because the footwear does not arrive on time. This makes her feel sad since they do not understand that she needs money in order to invest and to have extra footwear so that if one of her customers likes a shoe and she is able to get it the customer would go away happy since they have two shoes to choose from.  Do\u00f1a Mari says that she also makes a living selling American perfumes because her son orders perfumes so that she can sell them and thus have extra money.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mari is happily married to Se\u00f1or Cirio with whom she has five children who are already married.  Her children are named Daniel, Fidel, Fabiola, Isirino, and Jorge.  They love their mother very much and help her in whatever way they are able.  She asked for the loan so that she can buy more footwear for women, boys, girls, and men.  She tells us that she gives thanks to the Foundation for giving her the opportunity to get ahead and thus improve her quality of life and increase her business.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nEva Felicisima - Makes a living selling footwear.\r\nConsuelo - Makes a living selling Mexican snacks.\r\nMarcelina - Makes a living selling footwear.\r\nMargarita - Makes a living selling perfumes.\r\n\r\nThey give thanks to the Foundation for helping the good and hard-working people with their wishes to improve their lives and have a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1069611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy footwear to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-24T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-24T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva  Felicisima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7311.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7599.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8001.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8344.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8743.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":557.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":636.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":788.5,"local_amount":10341,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10418.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317533},{"amount":610.61,"local_amount":8008.05,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8068.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418918},{"amount":347.93,"local_amount":4563,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4597.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568494},{"amount":665.66,"local_amount":8729.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-27T08:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8795.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399804},{"amount":392.84,"local_amount":5152,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5190.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407538},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":503.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392218},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":536,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":540.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120130},{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":540,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":544.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284979},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":503.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596122},{"amount":86.18,"local_amount":1130.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840212}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T15:43:29Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":417004,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allen, a 34-year-old married mother of five children, lives in Kasese, Uganda where she has been in the bar and lodging business for seven years.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located near the main street. Her regular customers are neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe also operates a fishing boat for additional income. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages and for the maintenance of their boat. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArlyn hopes to grow her business and acquire another vehicle. She dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Erna sells new clothing, but she also makes garments.  She has been in this business for 12 years.  Her merchandise is sold from a stand located in the central part of her community.  There she works with her mother, who is in charge of handling direct sales.  Her work schedule is from Monday to Saturday, all day.  Once a week, Erna buys the merchandise she needs in bulk from distributors.  Her loan will be used to buy winter clothing, especially track suits and athletic shoes.  In addition, she will purchase fleece for making garments.  One of her goals is to have an established shop.\r\n<p>\r\nErna lives with her husband and two children, ages 24 and 18, who are in school.  One of her dreams for her family is to see her children become professionals.  She would also like to have a home of her own.  Erna is very pleased and grateful for the financial opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza to invest in her business.  She also enjoys the Communal Bank meetings with her group because the members are close and responsible.  \r\n<p>\r\nSan Bernardo is a city that is located 18 kilometers due south from the Plaza de Armas in Santiago (the Chilean capital).  It is known as the folklore capital since  the International Folklore Festival is held there every January.  This event highlights the various ethnic groups of the country and musical groups from all over South America gather there.  Chilean artisans, as well as those from other countries nearby, also participate in the Traditional Craft Fair.  In the month of April, an event called \"Abril Cuecas Mil\" celebrates the \"cueca\" (a traditional Chilean dance) throughout the entire community.

composed of three humble, cheerful, very hardworking women who want to improve their lives and give their children a better future.  The members of this group are from a town called Agua de Ca\u00f1a.  Just before arriving at Agua de Ca\u00f1a there is a river that belongs to Pinotepa called R\u00edo de Arena that\u2019s closer to the community of Agua de Ca\u00f1a than it is to Pinotepa.  The town of Agua de Ca\u00f1a is very small but it\u2019s quite beautiful because there are many green trees, much water and very large trees called \u201cparotas;\u201d  it\u2019s very cool and there are many animals like pigs, dogs and little goats.  One of Agua de Ca\u00f1a\u2019s traditions is the \u201cMayordom\u00edas\u201d [series of religious festivities] and the town\u2019s festival that take place each May 3rd.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Porfiria, a very kind and cheerful, 49-year-old woman.  Porfiria has been selling perfume for five years and she tells us that what she likes best about her business is going out to sell house to house and chatting with her customers because while she\u2019s chatting away with one and another, they buy perfume.\r\n\r\nWhat she doesn\u2019t like about her business is that some of her customers take their time to pay her and this makes her sad because she can\u2019t earn her profits.  One of her challenges is that sometimes she does not have money to invest in the purchase of more merchandise that she sometimes runs out of quickly.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to have a perfume shop in her community so that when her customers come by to buy they will feel comfortable and will be able to choose their perfumes.\r\n\r\nPorfiria is a widow and has five children who are married and are called: Daniel, Nayeli, Andrea, Yomara and Andr\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nPorfiria requested the loan to buy more perfumes to sell at retail.  She thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n for the opportunities it\u2019s given to improve their lives and have their own businesses. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nInocencia- sells shoes\r\nAlicia-

nature because there are many green trees; the weather is hot.  It\u2019s a town where you can see children running in the streets playing completely free and with no violence.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Ignacio German, 49, who is noted for being a somewhat quiet, hardworking man.  Don Ignacio, as he\u2019s better known by his fellow members and neighbors, owns a taxi that he works every day of the week except when he\u2019s planting corn transporting his neighbors in the community to the nearest city which is Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nHe also tells us that he works farming corn.  What he likes best about farming corn is that most seasons he gets good harvests and this makes him feel successful because he can have more profits and more corn.\r\n\r\nBecause Don Ignacio is diversified in his businesses, this time he asked for the loan to use in his taxi service.  He will buy spare parts for the taxi.  However, the loan will have an impact on both businesses because he will use profits from his taxi to plant corn.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that he\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for having opened doors to a new path to continue with his business and improve his and his community\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nJulia- sells meat\r\nLeticia- sells food\r\nGloria-

It is comprised of ten hard-working indigenous people who have the desire to improve themselves, to improve their lives, and to expand their businesses.  This way they will be able to give their children a better future. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, land of progress and growth.  The traditions of Pinotepa are the patron saints and the \u201cFiesta Quinto Viernes\u201d better known as Holy Week.  The games come, and many foreigners come to sell their handicrafts.  There are many small businesses in the community, and they reflect their work.  The people in Pinotepa wear petticoats and mandils (a type of apron).\r\n\r\nCristina, age 37, is one of the members of this group.  She is known for being hard-working and kind. Xochitl, as she is better known by her communal bank colleagues and friends, sells groceries like cookies, soft drinks, coffee, sugar, bread, beans, rice, oil, and chilies.  Xochitl tells us that she has a small place where she sells her merchandise and tends to her customers kindly and affectionately.  She always tries to have her store stocked so that her customers will find what they are looking for.\r\n\r\nXochitl tells us that what she likes the most about her business is having a store full of merchandise and waiting on her customers well.  What she does not like about her business is when she does not have enough money to buy more merchandise and her store is empty.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is very happy because, thanks to God, she has been able to continue her business, and, therefore, she has been able to improve her quality of life.  She asked for the loan to buy more groceries to sell.  She thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n for always giving her the opportunity to be an enterprising woman with hopes and dreams.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nGuadalupe- sells typical

She is married and has one child, aged five. In 2005, she established her grocery business. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy grocery goods for her business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rita plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

They are all from the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Irma can be found in the first row, second spot from the right, wearing a beige short-sleeved shirt.  Her hair is short and copper-colored.  She makes a living in the confectionery field, specifically in the production of cakes and pastries of different flavors and sizes.  She has worked in this field for 12 years, and says she took a course in a group which included her at that time.  She says that she has equipped a small place in her house so that she can prepare her products; nevertheless, she still cannot use it to sell directly to her clients because she still needs to obtain the health permit, which she will receive this year.  For now she only sells by asking door to door.  She buys her ingredients in wholesale supermarkets every three months.  With the loan she will buy ingredients to prepare her confectionery products.  One of her goals is to formalize her location and business in order to sell directly to her clients.\r\n\r\nIrma lives with her husband who is retired, and also with her 20 year old son who studies psychology.  One of her dreams in her personal life is to travel or spend a few days of relaxation in some thermal baths (baths of hot mineral water).  She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza since it will allow her to invest in her business.  Furthermore, she feels very comfortable participating with the other entrepreneurs since it is a good, united, and committed group.  With regard to the training, she says it has bettered her business through accounting strategies and organization.  \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile).  In its surrounding areas there are a series of lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) and very colorful native flora and fauna concentrated in nearby nature parks.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups who meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarissa hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having her own house.

With the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she sells these to people in Macroproyecto Ciudad Bicentenario, the place where she lives.\r\n\r\nShe had started her bakery in another neighborhood with her partner, but the rainy season floods eroded their dwelling and they lost their property. This was how she and her family were relocated to this large housing complex.\r\n\r\nKarina and her family are very persevering people, as before launching their store, they had been displaced from their land in Bol\u00edvar department, and subsequently, when they were working their hardest, they survived the rainy season flooding. But they are not letting themselves be defeated by adversity, and that's why they have launched their own bakery in Ciudad Bicentenario. \r\n\r\nBenefitting from their previous experience, they have in mind a store where they also sell snacks, food supplies, and basic household items. This is their business: Karina's husband prepares the bread and baked treats and she very creatively goes out to sell with her display case on wheels, selling all over the large neighborhood where she now lives.\r\n\r\nThey have many dreams of prosperity, such as fitting up a stand-alone store for the proper functioning of their small business.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why they are approaching their credikiva for their first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. By this means she will buy food items that are sold in stores, such as food supplies, meats, groceries, and ingredients in greater volume for making new bakery products.

He lives with his wife, who is his first priority.  With the loan he plans to purchase parts in order to repair his motorcycle.  What he wants is to be able to purchase the best used parts and the best quality so that his bike will not have problems over the short term and thus he will be able to accomplish his work in an adequate and efficient manner.  This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR.  He has not received other loans from state banks, but FUDECOSUR has given him the chance for a loan with greater ease and much lower interest rates.

These sales will help her to support her family, as she is a widow and has eight children.\r\n  \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health center.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, you can also see a woman in a yellow top with the group, she is the daughter of Ms. Porfiria."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1073222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Venta de coca","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12121.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":4040.4,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4058.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243446},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516314},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441249},{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495187},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260734}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T10:19:57Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":417462,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a 38-year-old married man living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand and continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to add to her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to afford to give her child a good and high quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is single and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past four years, Rose has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential commodities like sugar for resale, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Rose's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget for her family.
