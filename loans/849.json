Her husband is Joel, a vendor, and the father of her three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSylvia operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it for a small profit. Her products are men's and women's clothes and other products of the sort. Customers are attracted to buy due to her low prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSylvia hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and draw her family closer to God.

Molly is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past three years, Molly has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Molly has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food for resale and will help Molly to generate greater profits and take care of her family. Molly hopes that in the future she will be able to start a supermarket of her own. \r\n\r\nMolly is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Molly's future prospects by helping her to manage to take care of her family.

Her most recent loan was through Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1073721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Arena - Motupe - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-04-25T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-25T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mereyda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":123.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":130.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":138.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":144.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":106.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332884},{"amount":39.81,"local_amount":103.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":105.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423652},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":114.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":116.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317065},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":114.15,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":116.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373895},{"amount":44.77,"local_amount":116.8,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-22T08:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":118.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385144},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":123.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368732},{"amount":48.3,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977784},{"amount":49.91,"local_amount":130.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":132.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114992},{"amount":51.8,"local_amount":135.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":137.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506669},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":138.1,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":140.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058631},{"amount":55.43,"local_amount":144.6,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":147.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804227},{"amount":56.64,"local_amount":147.75,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T08:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":150.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364512422}],"funded_date":"2012-04-25T23:19:01Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T08:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The items he sells include food, drinks, mineral water, rice, instant noodles, stationery, and lamps and other electrical devices. Also--last but not least--he provides tire repair services. \n\nPak Martin runs this business along with his wife.

The ones who encouraged him the most are actually all of his neighbors. The reason is that with a Loket Ruma business, he can actually provide more value-added services for his customers and generate more income for his family. His customers, who are mostly his neighbors, would come to his Warung Pinki and pay their bills. He hopes that most of the payments will be for electricity bills. This loan will serve as a damage deposit for the electronic data capture (EDC) device that as an agent, Pak Martin will use to enter payments and print receipts for customers.

She used her first loan to purchase a sewing machine.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business.  Mukaddas has been obtaining financing from our organization since 2009 and never had an occurrence of late payments.

her. One of her five children is still in school while the others are garment workers and construction workers. Rice farming is Phina's primary source of income to support the family. She farms on a 1.5 hectare farmland once per year, and she has been in this business for almost 14 years. She supplements her income by feeding chickens to sell once every three months. \r\n\r\nLiving in a village of the Prey Chhor district, she has been facing several challenges in earning to support her family, such as fruitless rice farming and low earned income to support her five children.

She is married and has four children, aged 20, 17, nine, and four years. In 2001, Adama established her palm oil and garri business. She began her business because she is not educated but she does not want to be dependent on anyone for her survival. Working seven days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

Her three brothers are fishermen and are part of her business.  In their business they have a fishing boat with an outboard motor and two gill nets.  They fish in the Ca\u00f1o Dulce area, a resort located 30 minutes from Puerto Colombia, and they take the fish to Rosa for her to sell.  This business has been running for 20 years and they have a reputable client base.  Additionally, Rosa has a stand where she sells beer on weekends, a business independent from her brothers.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan because the investment in the working capital of her business is a challenge.  With this first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo foundation she will buy beer directly instead of from middlemen and will be able to repair the two nets.

She also learned how to help her children with their education.  The loan she is requesting now will be invested in the purchase of potatoes and the salary of her workers.

Her business, launched 17 years ago with a starting sum of 3,000 som (KGS), currently earns around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products. Her business profits have allowed Gulnara to expand the range of her activities and to start planting potatoes and wheat. In order to continue developing her business, Gulnara has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and subsequent resale.

He has been running a transportation business since 2001 and has gained a lot of experience. With the initial business earnings, he bought a small-sized piece of land and a small, old house. But in the past few years, his income has been declining due to fewer job orders.\r\n\r\nLast summer, he started to rebuild his old house. His previous house was very old and absolutely in unlivable condition. Erdenebat was trying to finish rebuilding his house before winter started. This time, he is planning to build an entrance hall for his house. The loan he is taking will be dedicated to purchase the building materials to build it.

20 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en Puerto Colombia, un municipio ubicado  a la orilla del mar caribe, con un potencial tur\u00edstico importante, en tanto muchas de las familias de Barranquilla y otras ciudades cercanas se trasladan all\u00ed, para disfrutar de su paisaje de playa brisa y mar y de las deliciosas comidas a base de pescado de mar, que se venden alrededor de la playa. \u00c1ngel desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, se dedica a  la venta de pescado, actividad que se ide\u00f3, despu\u00e9s de haber experimentado vendiendo mercanc\u00eda variada a cr\u00e9dito. Los proveedores principales de \u00c1ngel,  son los pescadores  del balneario de Puerto Velero, hermoso y  tur\u00edstico lugar, donde este traslada  en una moto de su propiedad  y trasporta el pescado en cavas de pl\u00e1stico e icopor; cuando la pesca es abundante \u00c1ngel contrata  un carro para traer a Puerto Colombia su producto estrella. Los espec\u00edmenes que mas comercializa son Sable, corvina, caritos, cojin\u00faa, sierra, robalo, pargo, chivo, y langostino. Cuando hay subienda de pescado, \u00c1ngel distribuye entre varios vendedores para que ellos tambi\u00e9n comercialicen en su pueblo. La jornada laboral de \u00c1ngel inicia desde las 5:00 A.M. con un viaje a Puerto Velero y regresa a las 7:30 A.M. Luego hace los repartos y se desocupa a las 12:00 M. Los principales clientes son vecinos del sector, que se encuentran pensionados a quienes les otorga cr\u00e9dito,  para que al final del mes cuando reciban su dinero le paguen. Gran parte del cr\u00e9dito que solicita, lo destinar\u00e1 a financiar las ventas a cr\u00e9dito, pues ante la calidad de sus frescos productos su clientela se incrementa y requiere tener capital de trabajo para aprovechar oportunidades.  En la actualidad \u00c1ngel est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el que comprar\u00e1 pescado en mayor volumen que el acostumbrado y aumentar el volumen de ventas y con ello sus ingresos, importantes para fortalecer el bienestar de su familia.    ","en":"\u00c1ngel, 45, is married and has two children, aged 18 and 20.  He lives in Puerto Colombia, a town located on the coast of the Caribbean, with great tourist potential; such that many families from Barranquilla and other nearby cities relocate there to enjoy its beach and sea breeze and the delicious fish dishes offered along the beach.\r\n\r\nFor four years \u00c1ngel has been selling fish, which was an idea he came up with after selling different merchandise on credit.  His main suppliers are fishermen in Puerto Velero, which is a beautiful tourist location.  He drives his motorcycle there and collects the fish in plastic and styrofoam containers.  When fish is abundant, \u00c1ngel rents a car to bring his star product to Puerto Colombia.  The species he sells are saberfish, sea bass, perch, red jack, saw fish, white snook, dog snapper, chivo and shrimp.  When there is abundant fish, \u00c1ngel distributes it among several sales people who sell in their villages.  \u00c1ngel's work day begins at 5:00 a.m. when he travels to Puerto Velero, returning at 7:30 a.m.  He then makes deliveries until 12:00 noon.\r\n\r\nHis main customers are retired neighbors to whom he extends credit and then collects from at the end of the month.  Most of the loan he is requesting will be used to finance his credit sales, since he requires working capital to take advantage of the quality fresh products to increase clientele.  Currently, \u00c1ngel is applying for his first CrediKiva loan through the Mario Santo Foundation, which he intends to use to buy more fish than he usually does so he can increase sales and income to strengthen his family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1074335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy greater volumes of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-26T09:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-26T09:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141235},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101116},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338729},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395291},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775095},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387081},{"amount":300,"local_amount":525000,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":529500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993937}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T20:17:11Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":416752,"name":"Santa Rosa De Yanacoto Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca es socio de la Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cSanta Rosa De Yanacoto\u201d la cual est\u00e1 integrado por 12 socios unidos, siendo la gran mayor\u00eda vecinos de la zona.

Mary is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala south region of Uganda. For the past year, Mary has been working hard to manage her food business, which sells soft drinks like soda and passion fruit. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soda and fruits for resale, and will help Mary to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Mary hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Mary's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

is Rosana, 47, who is a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Cleto, a driver, and mother to her four children. By the grace of God, Rosana has managed to support her children's schooling. She works hard to continually provide an income for her family\u2019s everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosana oversees the family\u2019s their jeepney* transportation business. She has a vehicle that has the capacity for 14-16 people that earns a daily quota each day. Rosana\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nRosana is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan to help continue her business operations, buy spare parts, and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Rosana dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* Curiously, jeepneys have a purely American origin. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, saw this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified it into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1077667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to
