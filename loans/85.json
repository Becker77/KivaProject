Profits from his business allowed him to build a better barn for his animals and help his sons start their own households. Currently Mukan owns a cow, a calf, a horse, 10 sheep, 10 lambs and 5 goats, and his business yields a monthly profit of 17,000 som (KGS). To further enlarge his herd, Mukan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 106,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional heads of cattle.

She is involved in all types of work, such as taking care of the children, making national pies in her free time and selling them at a school.  And at home, having obtained our first loan, she purchased calves and fattens them up.  This business for her is like extra savings for unforeseen family expenses because she can always spend something, once she sells calves.  The client's family conditions are not very good, and this is why she is involved in several businesses.  Nevertheless, Matluba works punctually and diligently runs her budget.  She is obtaining her next loan to purchase livestock and is very happy that she is partnering with us to have this financial support, when she needs it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":943966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matluba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":116.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":120.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":132.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.75,"local_amount":116.73,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":127.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257754408},{"amount":27.63,"local_amount":120.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381599},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":124.54,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":135.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095117},{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":128.63,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":140.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919578},{"amount":30.45,"local_amount":132.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":144.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197597},{"amount":31.45,"local_amount":137.24,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197264},{"amount":32.48,"local_amount":141.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":154.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397318},{"amount":68.22,"local_amount":297.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":324.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452161}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T19:27:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":378302,"name":"Valentine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentine is 27 years old.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is married with 4 children. Nine years ago, Ehtibor began selling shoes in the market, since her husband\u2019s income was not enough to cover her children\u2019s expenses. That was how she got a taste for the business and was convinced that it left her sufficient revenue. Currently, she works in this business full-time, and thanks to her enthusiasm, she has made a name for herself in the market. However, her clients request more and more things each day, which is why Ehtibor is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni, which she is willing to repay in a 7-month term. With this money, Ehtibor will be able to purchase more goods and therefore give her business a boost. With your help, Ehtibor will be able to help her children prosper so that they may one day go to college.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

you.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":325025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Los ahorros que hab\u00eda guardado Marcelina durante 10 a\u00f1os, por fin tienen sus frutos, puesto que con ellos pudo comprar el bus que tanto ansiaba, el cual ahora a brinda el servicio de transporte de pasajeros Juliaca \u2013 Moho (Distrito de Puno). Gracias a esto, sus ganancias han mejorado, ya que anteriormente su \u00fanica fuente de ingresos era su restaurante, el cual sigue adelante progresando poco a poco. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Marcelina de su nuevo trabajo como cobradora del bus, es que le permite viajar constantemente y disfrutar del paisaje, lleva reci\u00e9n 6 meses en esta actividad y lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que madrugar para cumplir con los horarios de salida. Sabe que es duro, pero que a la larga le dar\u00e1 muy buenos resultados, espera que en el futuro pueda comprar otro bus y salir adelante m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido. Este es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, sabe que tiene que cumplir con todas sus cuotas a tiempo, si no quiere causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, en el cual es muy querida por la alegr\u00eda que demuestra. Con los mil nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 un televisor nuevo para el bus, para que los pasajeros puedan distraerse durante el viaje.","en":"Marcelina is 33 years old and a loving and caring mother. She lives in her own house with her 45-year-old husband Mariano and her two children, Yesenia (14) and Rolando (3), who are the inspiration for all their efforts. The savings Marcelina has accrued over the past 10 years have finally paid off, now that they can purchase the bus that they have always longed to buy, which now provides transportation service to passengers from Juliaca to Moho (in the Puno district). Thanks to this, their earnings have increased, since their only previous source of income was their restaurant, which has been growing little by little. What Marcelina enjoys most from her new job as a bus conductor is that it lets her travel constantly and enjoy the trip. She has spent 6 months at this job and the most difficult aspect for her is waking up early to follow the bus schedule. She knows this job is hard work, but will bring her good results in the long run. She hopes to buy another bus in the future and move forward even faster.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina's second loan with MFP. She knows that she has to make her payments on time so as not to cause problems for the other members of her loan group.

She makes hand-made crafts that she sells in her own general store.  She began these activities based on her own creativity and self-taught skills in the area and the marketplace.\n\nRosa is a very intelligent woman who takes full advantage of all her knowledge.  She is always making items according to the season, the market and their profitability.  She adapts quickly to product changes when necessary because she is able to adjust to market requirements.  This is what happened previously when she used to make ceramic items but sales became complicated due to high competition.  She was able to stay in business learning different manual skills and techniques like the ones she practices today making rag dolls and cloth crafts in her own workshop.  She has a machine to manufacture them and a sales point in her own home which she uses quite efficiently in that she added other merchandise like female articles, decorative figures, kitchen decorations, home goods, multiple-use clothing items that also generate profits.\n\nThis is her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that will be used to buy raw materials and ingredients like: fabric, faces, cotton filling and Christmas decorations for the December sales season.  She used her first loan to increase working capital and acquired new customers.  She wants to use her Kiva loan to continue growing especially to reach her dream and great challenge of having a large store specializing in her own products.\n

She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Ranjana plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Her potential clients are people around the market area.

Her husband is a businessman who helps provide for the family's basic needs. Nadzuwa has a house with neither electricity nor piped water.

He has been a farmer his whole life in this area, where rice is the primary crop. Angel has livestock on his farm as a secondary source of income. He raises chicken and grows many different fruits for personal consumption and small sales. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to more efficiently plant rice and involve his 3 children in the activities. They are all almost done with school and are interested in taking part in the family business. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angel is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despte its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security.

She started her business with the first credit she received from Manuela Ramos as a member of the Communal Bank \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" (hard-working women).  She received 300 nuevos soles from them (about $100) five years ago.  She used to devote herself to housework and helping her husband on their small farm.  With this money, she bought cuajada (a yogurt-like product) and took it to Trujillo to sell.  This is how she started a grocery store little by little in her community.  She still takes cuajada to Trujillo on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  This loan from Manuela Ramos of 1,200 nuevos soles (about $403), to be repaid in 4 months, will be used to buy rice, sugar, noodles, canned goods, and other products to supply her grocery store.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

She owns & operates a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Foai needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Foai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Foai's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nFoai's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Eseta has 5 years of experience in this business.  Eseta needs a loan of WST $2000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nEseta joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eseta M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He started this business 7 years ago with a small number of livestock, but as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. According to Jangiboy, he works very hard so that he can take care of his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve his family's living. Currently, he needs a loan of 6000 Somoni in order to purchase more cattle to later resell after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the needs of his family and educate his children.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have 2 small children, and all live together in their own cozy home that they built through much sacrifice.  Ricardo's dedication and industriousness have made him one of the best producers of bananas and coffee in the Sanchirio Palomar area.  In spite of being young, he is a responsible father and this motivates him to continue working so that he can provide the best for his family.  At times he is helped out by his wife, especially during the harvest season.  Normally, he works in the fields and his wife carries out the domestic tasks and cares for their children.  For more than a year he has worked in agriculture, and what he likes most is to cultivate and clear his coffee lands.  On the other hand, he does not enjoy the market in his city where they want to haggle on price, where the wholesalers claim that their price is the real market price.  In spite of all of this, he considers this line of work to be sufficiently profitable, since he can cover the household expenses, educate his children and, above all, save.  Currently he has 2 hectares of bananas, and he wants to buy 2 more hectares of land so that he can add to his cultivations and have increased production.  This is the first time that he has taken a loan from MFP, and he is enthusiastic about the idea of working with a communal group where there are rules and regulations to comply with.  With the loan he requests, he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":551138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588206}],"funded_date":"2010-06-12T15:08:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210291,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victoria, de 28 a\u00f1os es una madre de familia muy responsable y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Samuel de 29 a\u00f1os y su \u00fanico hijo Yonatan de 10 a\u00f1os.

nomadic housing tent) in a rented yard. Having moved from another soum (a small village) called Olziit to their current soum four years ago, they have been residing in their present home for two years. Chimed's oldest two sons, aged 11 and 6, attend a local primary school. <p>\r\n\r\nChimed has been operating an underwear and outerwear clothing trading business since 2007, having gained much experience in previous years. His sister helps him purchase his products from Ereen, a Chinese border town, and brings clothing to him.

They live with 2 of their children and one of their grandchildren in their own home.  For more than 5 years he has cultivated coffee and bananas, work that has helped him to live comfortably with his family.  At times his wife helps him with the work, especially during the harvest seasons, since he has to harvest the coffee beans in the least amount of time possible.  In spite of the fact that it is tedious to be a farmer, he is committed to his farming activities because he considers them to be very profitable, and this allows him to meet his basic needs.  He says also that he very much enjoys clearing his lands, which makes it easier to grow his plants.  On the other hand, he dislikes it when the wholesalers haggle over the prices of his harvests referring to the law of supply and demand.  For this reason he tries to work with associations or consortia, who pay a fair price that encourages him to keep working.  Over time he is thinking about acquiring his own land, since he is currently cultivating on rented fields.  In addition, he plans to increase his production, particularly of bananas, which generate bi-weekly income.  This is the second time that he has taken a loan with MFP, and he is proud to belong to a well-organized group and is pleased to work with its members.  With the loan he requests he will buy 7 bags of fertilizer and supplies to prevent weed growth on his land.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":551162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 7 bags of fertilizer and supplies to prevent weed growth    ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tereso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588207}],"funded_date":"2010-06-11T00:47:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210307,"name":"Lucinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucinda, de 38 a\u00f1os, es una madre muy amorosa y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Andres de 40 a\u00f1os y sus 3 hijos, a quienes desea brindarles una mejor educaci\u00f3n.

next is 10, and the last is 7 years old. Caline is  a businesswoman but her husband is jobless and because of that, Caline works hard in order to provide for her family. Caline's business is well-known which is an advantage for her; the hours of her daily activities are from 8 in the morning to 7 in the evening every day except on Sunday.

Sr., age 31, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have three children who are 5 to 10 years old. This picture was taken after the center meeting because her fish business was already sold out early in the morning.\r\n\r\nCorsine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Corsine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000; thus, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish vending business. She will continue to save up for the future and meet the daily needs of her family.

The main challenge she has faced in her life has been the death of her father, sicknesses and the lack of capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in 2005 and has since then received and repaid Empowerment Credit four times. She invested her past loans in farming, neathing and in the retail of some Tianshi products. She used the profit from these activities to buy books, pay school fees and to feed and clothe her family. Given a loan, she will invest in the retail of Tianshi food supplements, in farming and to buy and sell raw foodstuffs. She believes that this business will be a success because her prices are moderate and she already has a good number of customers. This business activity will be of help to the community in that it will reduce the distance they would have traveled to the market to get foodstuff. Her farming activity will increase the quantity of food available in the market for the people in her community.\r\n\r\nShe will use the profit from this business to pay fees for her children and to dress them.

Sonia, who is the president of the group, has worked since she was twelve years old. She didn\u2019t have the support of her father because he passed away when she was 5 years old. Since then, she started to work with her siblings selling stuffed potatoes, jelly, and popcorn. She alone had to pay for her high school education and for her technical nursing education. She couldn\u2019t complete her education, however, because of a lack of money. Today, at the age of 28, Sonia has received her ninth loan from the financial institution, EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD (prosperity).

Conducting business at home, her husband regularly works as a welder, while Kulmira trades in milk, buying from villagers and reselling it in a market. One of her sons mends cell phones and the other son sells milk and cheese.  As well, the whole family receives orders and provides Western-style renovation services.  The family\u2019s eight-year activity has allowed them to buy a car and furniture. Kulmira\u2019s current income is around $240 per month. <p>\r\n\r\nNow, the next project is to buy a milk cow. Because Kulmira values time and does not want to lose time saving money, she hopes to get a loan to hasten the process of acquiring the cow. In the future, she has pretty determined plans of opening a cheese-producing factory, increasing the number of livestock, and buying new furniture for the house. <p>\r\n\r\nKulmira\u2019s partners are Kulsina, Salyi and Nurgul.  Kulsina, 59, married to a metalworker, has five children. In addition to being a housewife, she manages to keep a cow and four sheep for reselling. Even though they do not have much livestock, they have been able to increase their number.  She is requesting a loan to purchase sheep.<p>\r\n\r\nSalyi, 51, is the divorced mother of a 19-year-old-daughter.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Noela has many years of experience in this business.  Noela needs a loan of WST $1300 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Noela joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Noela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Noela A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This is because the town is located on the coast of the beautiful Yssyk Kul Lake.  The current situation in the town is fairly sad.  Emptiness and pale cascades of huge factories remind us of the former might of this town.  Aynura C., who is the leader of this group, lives in Balykchi.  She is forty-one years old.  Aynura is a caring mother, wife and also a conscientious teacher.  She is raising three sons.  The oldest son is already eighteen years old.  He attends a conservatory and dreams of becoming a national artist.  The middle and youngest sons are fourteen and twelve years old respectively.  They both attend school for now.  Aynura\u2019s husband tends livestock and is involved in animal husbandry.  He fattens the livestock, butchers it and sells the meat wholesale.  Aynura works as a Russian language teacher at a secondary school.  Because Aynura is closely involved with the education sphere, she understands the importance of education to the future of her children.  Aynura and her husband spent several years planning the financial aspects of their children\u2019s education.  Four years ago, they started using their savings to buy small livestock, which they then sold at the market and among their acquaintances.  This is how they found an opportunity to earn some extra money.  However, one salary of a shepherd and a salary of a school teacher, and a small income from their business are not enough to provide their children with a valuable education.  Currently, Aynura needs a loan.  She needs to repay a debt for her son\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nAynura has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nAygul S. is forty-two years old.  Her husband works at a special purpose squad.  Aygul is a secondary school teacher.  She has a very low salary of just 1850 som.  However, her husband\u2019s salary saves the whole family.  Aygul requested the loan in order to buy furniture or a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nNazgul A. is thirty-eight years old.  Her husband works as a dispatcher.  Together, they are raising three children.  Nazgul\u2019s daughter will complete eleventh grade this year.  Due to this, Nazgul requested a loan in order to buy clothing for her daughter.  And she wants to use the rest of the money to buy household goods.\r\n\r\nDamira Mysagulova is forty-seven years old.  She works at a secondary school as a librarian and also as a teacher.  Damira has five children.  Two of them already attend colleges.  Her husband works at the boiler-room of the municipal hospital.  Damira decided to request a loan because she needs to repay her daughter\u2019s contract.  She dreams of buying a car for her son.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":508392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Repaying son's education loan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aynura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7718},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8075},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8448},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8839},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9248},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9672}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.96},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.11,"local_amount":7718,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7863.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715756},{"amount":186.34,"local_amount":8075,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8227.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748603},{"amount":194.96,"local_amount":8448,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8607.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931577},{"amount":203.97,"local_amount":8839,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":9006.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670590},{"amount":436.62,"local_amount":18920,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19277.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884243}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T19:25:39Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":189839,"name":"Purevjav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purevjav is 37 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Arhangai province, Mongolia.

She is a native of San Bernardo del Viento, near Cartagena, where her father worked in the fields and her mother tailored clothing for friends and relatives. Alcira learned the art of dressmaking watching her mother and even started out by making clothing for her dolls as a child. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 19 she got married and moved to Barranquilla, where her husband worked and where she would eventually have three children. Alcira began taking a course in tailoring to learn more and perfect her art. \r\n\r\nAt 27, her husband abandoned her with her young children. Until then she had been working as an employee at a well-known clothier, but her salary  wasn't enough to cover rent, food and the cost of a babysitter for her children while she was at work. So after 16 years, she quit and used her cash on hand to begin her own business that she could run out of her home. \r\n\r\nShe bought two simple, pedal-powered sewing machines and with her mother started to sew and sell her products to shops in malls around Barranquilla. Since then, she has stopped working, meanwhile raising her children to become professionals: an electro-mechanical engineer, an electro-mechanical technician and a doctor. She came to  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo at the recommendation of a friend. Since then she has received three loans, ranging in size from approximately $400 to $1,500, that have helped her buy equipment and grow her business to the point that she was able to hire three employees, all women heads-of-family. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from Kiva, Alcira plans to buy supplies, including linen, zippers and accessories, to make into clothing for women, men, and children. Currently, her fixed assets include three electric sewing machines, two more advanced\/industrial sewing machines for working with denim, a fabric cutter and a cutting table. \r\n\r\nAlcira is very grateful to her parents, her children and FMSD for giving her a hand in building her business. In the future, she hopes to continue becoming more and more successful so that she can employ more women heads-of-family so that they too can develop as she has.\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\n\r\nAlcira Isabel Ram\u00edrez D. es una mujer muy interesante por su gran creatividad y su gran capacidad de trabajo; oriunda de San Bernardo del Viento, en el departamento de C\u00f3rdoba, lugar donde su padre realizaba labores del campo y su madre confeccionaba ropa a familiares y amigos, aprendi\u00f3 el arte de confeccionar vi\u00e9ndola a ella, e inici\u00f3 haci\u00e9ndole ropa a las mu\u00f1ecas que ten\u00eda en su ni\u00f1ez.

He says that the income from his farming will help pay college fees for one of his children.

She doesn't only work hiring out chairs for different occasions such as fiestas, community meetings and big celebrations but also sells clothes, cosmetics and decorations and small trinkets which her customers request, particularly housewives, for gifts.  As the end of the year is approaching Elvia knows perfectly well how busy the market is over the Christmas period, she is requesting a Kiva loan to buy chairs to hire out for events since the 210 which she already has are not enough.  She will also buy merchandise to renew what she already has.\r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She used her previous loans to make great progress in her business because she increased her number of customers and was able to have available what they needed.  She has also seen improvements in her personal life, in terms of her own independence and, in her home as well, as she has managed to improve her family's well-being.  Currently, her customers are people to whom she has been recommended, housewives and young people who love the trinkets she sells as they look beautiful.  She serves her customers from 9.00am to 5.00pm, Monday to Saturday.  Elvia's business has its working capital in amounts receivable and in some in-stock merchandise which needs to be renewed.

She earns her living by operating a clothing sales business. Her husband Jamal, who is 35 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 3 and 6 years old. Myla joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myla has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

This is 43-year-old Mary M. from Mwanza.  Married with four children between the ages of seven and twenty, Mary has been running a grocery business selling water, soda, biscuits, flours, and sugar since 2005. Working at the business 16 hours a day, seven days per week and assisted by husband, she currently earns about $400 each month. She is requesting a loan of $950 in order to buy more soda, flours, sugar, and water, and in the future plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. Mary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has been creating handcrafted embroideries for 25 years and sells beautiful hand-worked crafts.  She is known as one of the best embroiderers of her area.  The finished skirts are worn by women during local traditional celebrations.  Now she is very cheerful about the future because some villagers are returning after a long time away and they are placing large orders for the upcoming celebrations.  Elva thinks of her work as a profession which she enjoys every day.  In addition to embroidery she raises animals to sell at market after a certain time.  This is Elva's first loan with MFP, she is committed to working in a group and to being punctual in her repayments.  She will use the loan to buy large quantities of wool in a medley of colours in order to embroider the traditional skirts as well as to pay the salary of an assistant she will hire so she can finish the embroideries more quickly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":275925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for embroidering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T23:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117154},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012065},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595651},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989912},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211044},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640537}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T00:36:55Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":94773,"name":"Shanti Singh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Shanti Singh T. lives in a single-family home with her husband and their one son in Sainbu-Bhaishipati Lalitpur.

With this loan of 1200 PEN she will purchase sweets, such as: Sublimes chocolates, Ca\u00f1onazo candies, lollipops, gum, and different flavor and brand caramels, to be able to satisfy her clients needs. Part of the money will also be invested in the purchase of supplies to make her meals. She feels very satisfied with the work she carries out, and she thinks it is worth the sacrifice to be able to fulfill her dreams and goals that she has set for herself.

She is very young, but she likes to work and can cover her expenses alone, even though she lives with her parents.  She studies at night and works in the store during the day.  The loan will be used to buy a container of oil,  containers, and groceries since she has demand for these products and hopes to grow her store to later convert it into a full grocery store.  One of Rosario's dreams is to finish her studies and buy a house so she can rent it out and thus have more income to help her parents  as with the business from her store she only maintains the home.  She works all day and sometimes is very tired when going to classes at the college.  It is hard, but she continues on.

To keep up with the demand, Aram requires a new fridge to hygienically store the raw products, a modern high-productivity oven and a fryer to produce pizza, lahmajo (flatbread baked with meat), hot dogs and other meals and snacks. This will increase the family business drastically and keep the clientele happy.

They have two children who are 6 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nAires joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Aires has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 13,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future to send her children to school.

He lives in his own home with his 44 year-old wife Mar\u00eda and his three young children who are all in school.  They work hard every day to get ahead in life.  For 10 years this entrepreneur has been working buying and selling different clothing fashions.  He says that the income is steady since he buys his goods in the capital for a low price then transports them to different provinces.  In the different places he travels to, he sells the garments at a higher price and he is very satisfied because he has been acquiring a customer base which is aware of the quality of the fashions which he offers.  He says that he likes his business a lot because he enjoys the trips he makes.  Although he works alone, he would like to be able to carry more goods and expand his business.  For this reason, he would like to hire an assistant.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan Santiago has had from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments in a timely manner because he doesn't want to give a bad impression to the people who, through funding his loan, will help him to continue working in search of progress.

She got divorced a few years ago and operates a jewelry making and selling business. After her divorce, she settled in her brother\u2019s home and started her business because she didn\u2019t want to become a burden on him. She is very skillful in her work and gets regular orders from different jewelers in the city. \r\n\r\nGoghi lives in Sahiwal which is famous for its cow species and agriculture industry. She lives there in a two-room brick house with her brother and his family. She has a five-year-old son who also lives with her and has not started his education yet. Besides her business, Goghi also takes care of household responsibilities and her son. \r\n\r\nGoghi has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for the expansion of her jewelry business. With the loan, she will buy materials such as beads, wires and glue for making jewelry in bulk quantity. This will help her offer more variety to her clients and make more profits. Goghi started her business 12 years ago and it is working very well for her. She won't leave this work and her marriage as well. She offers her jewelry at cheaper rates \u2013 that\u2019s why she has a good number of clients. \r\n\r\nGoghi is hopeful that a loan investment will help her make larger profits and she will be able to start saving some money every month for her son\u2019s education. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fourth loan application. In previous loan years, she has responsibly made her payments and never gave any chance of

She has been living there for past 17 years with her family in a 2-room brick house. She is 40 years old and married to S. M. who operates a livestock business. He has a cow and a buffalo. He collects the milk by getting up early in the morning everyday and he sells to his community members. He also sells cattle (goats), by raising them as the customers require. \r\n\r\nRobina is a housewife. She stays at home and does her household responsibilities. She takes her responsibilities very seriously and makes the utmost effort to give comfort to her family by fulfilling their needs. In her spare time, she also assists her husband by taking care of his cattle. \r\n\r\nRobina is the mother of a 7 year old daughter who is studying in class 3rd. She also has a 6 year old son who is studying in class 2nd. Robina couldn\u2019t get an education herself due to the poor financial circumstances of her parents. But, she wants to provide a quality education for her children so that they become successful in their lives. \r\n\r\nRobina has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her husband\u2019s business. Through the loan, he will buy cattle (goats) for selling at a profit. He has been doing this business for the past 12 years. Robina hopes that, after the loan investment, her husband\u2019s business will be in a more profitable position and it will result in a better financial condition for her family.
