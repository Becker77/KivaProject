She is a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She pays for her children's schooling and works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCarmelita oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one-unit jeepney with a 14-16 person capacity, who pay a daily quota. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan for 11,000 PHP, which she will use to to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCarmelita dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week.  \r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study tGod, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1077672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. In the future, she hopes to grow her business and she dreams of giving her family a good future with all of her hard work on her business. Marites faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1077678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for maintenance, spare parts, and accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-26T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-26T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marites","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1419.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606807},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3550.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095694},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2839.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359303},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2840.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303118}],"funded_date":"2012-04-26T19:24:28Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":418145,"name":"Leakey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leakey is 31 years old and married and with two children.

The loan will be used to buy more charcoal for resale and will help Halimah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her kid. Halimah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nHalimah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Halimah's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Four years ago he discovered the perfect avenue to fund his own business on, pulling from his entrepreneurial spirit, extensive business experience, and personal connections in Venezuela, where he used to reside.

In cooperation with his connections in Venezuela, Leonardo moved to Florida, where he now lives, and founded his own business. One of the largest hurdles that he has faced in this process has been securing the funds which will help him purchase the wholesale products that he will later ship internationally.

The capital from the new loan cycle will be used by the Trust Bank members to boost the productivity of their businesses \u2013 benefiting not only them but also their families. Having named their group \"Shalom\" (Peace) for a reason, the members hope every loan cycle brings their families closer to contentment. \r\n\r\nMost group members are from the municipality of Olintepeque in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Olintepeque has paved roads that connect its villages, with farms scattered among the villages. Residents of the area are primarily engaged in growing corn, wheat, beans, green beans, peas, oats, potatoes, and fruits. Some residents make crafts, including jewelry, leather, wax and wood. The languages spoken in Olintepeque are Spanish and K'iche.\r\n\r\nOlivia, who is one of the youngest members of the Shalom Trust Bank, is 24 years old and is a single mother of two boys (an eight-year-old who is already in school and a two-year-old). Olivia is a street vendor who sells fruits and <i>pupusas<\/i> (a type of traditional food), which she has been doing for about eight years. She sells in eight different villages and works six days a week. Some days, Olivia leaves home at 6:30 a.m. and does not return until 8 p.m. \r\n\r\nHaving never completed her education, Olivia decided to go back to school and is now in the fifth grade. She hopes to continue learning and, one day, become a teacher. For Olivia, being part of Friendship Bridge and having access to small loans is really helpful because she can now earn an income to support herself and her two children, give her children an education and continue her own education. \r\n\r\nWith a new loan through Kiva lenders, Olivia will buy a variety of fruits so that she can continue to expand her business\u2014her clientele is growing and she needs to keep up! Besides completing her education, Olivia dreams of one day owning a proper storefront to sell her fruit. She struggles with her business during the rainy season because it is difficult to travel. With a storefront, her clients would know where she is at all times and be able to come to her. \r\n\r\nOlivia and her fellow Shalom Trust Bank members are thrilled that people from other countries want to help them. They are grateful for the support of Kiva lenders because they are not only gaining financial assistance but also they are building success. The Shalom Trust Bank sends their blessings. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1078246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of fruits and chickens.

The group named their trust bank Arcoiris (rainbow) because the rainbow resembles the spectrum of colors used in their traditional clothing. \r\n\r\nThis group is located in the village of Juchanep, which is a rural community about 30 minutes away from downtown Totonicap\u00e1n in southwestern Guatemala. The languages spoken in Juchanep are Spanish and K'iche.\r\n\r\nThe Arcoiris Trust Bank will be starting their sixth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. The women are anxiously waiting for their new loans, which will help fund their various businesses and enable them to prepare for the village fair, which is set for June 2012. The fair is one of their biggest selling events of the year. Nine of the Trust Bank members are weavers and the others are involved in commerce activities of some sort.\r\n \r\nPaulina is one of the founders of the Trust Bank. Named after her grandmother, she only has a second-grade education but is a very proactive and dynamic woman. Paulina is 36 years old, has four children and is currently the president of the Arcoiris Trust Bank. \r\n\r\nPaulina has worked in the textiles industry for 15 years. Her business has grown considerably over the years, and she currently has two full-time employees. Paulina and her employees are able to make nine cortes (typical skirts) a week, but in high demand seasons, they work longer hours and can produce enough cortes to keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her textile business, Paulina recently started raising chickens. With this new loan from Kiva, Paulina plans to buy a variety of threads to make several cortes that clients have ordered, and she plans to buy more chickens to raise. Paulina's dreams are to employ at least two more people and to continue to support her children's education.\r\n\r\nThe Arcoiris Trust Bank members appreciate the support Kiva lenders provide and the trust Kiva lenders put in their businesses, which helps the Trust Bank members' families and improves their lives.

Her husband is Domingo, her business partner. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJesusa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small amounts to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a small amount of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJesusa hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1078465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T08:00:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":5067,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5112.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606811},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5066,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5111.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095698},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5067.04,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5112.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359307},{"amount":90,"local_amount":3799.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3833.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303122}],"funded_date":"2012-04-29T17:56:53Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":418465,"name":"Ma.elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma.Elena is 38 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Her husband, Melchor, is also her business partner. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nFlorife operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the unit. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also does direct selling for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 32,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlorife hopes that her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1078470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He lives in his own home in a rural area with his wife and children. He is characterized as an enterprising , responsible and hardworking man. He has grown basic grains and sugar cane for a long time. Every year he harvests and sells these products. That is how he makes a living and brings home the daily bread to his home every day. This business is his main source of income and he wants to continue with this activity for more time since this is the only way to help the family and get ahead and try to give them a better quality of life every day. That is why every day he gets up very early to farm the land and give his family what it deserves, as they are his main source of inspiration. To do this he has decided to take out a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in the necessary materials (seeds, poison for the pests, fertilizer, etc.) to increase the crop of basic grains and sugar cane. This is the only way he knows how to earn a living and he wants to do everything possible so that the crop this year will be very productive. He is very confident that this way he will achieve his goal and give his family a better quality of life than the one they have.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1075107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds, poison for pests, fertilizer, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T10:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T10:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00c1lvaro Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447251}],"funded_date":"2012-05-27T10:13:59Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:23:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":418523,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna works hard to support her family.

For the past 3 years, she has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, she has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like sugar for resale, and that will help Grace generate greater profits and pay for her own school fees. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to to study up to the university. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Grace 's future prospects by helping her expand her business that helped her go back to school.

Eva is 22 years old and lives in the town of Wobulenzi in the Luweero region of Uganda. For the past 4 years, she has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Eva has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase cooking oil and will help Eva to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her siblings. She hopes that in the future she will be able to study hairdressing. \r\n\r\nEva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased her future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

At that time, she experimented with various businesses, looking for one that was profitable.  She realized that selling cosmetics was very profitable, and decided to go into this business.  With the investment from her previous loan, she was able to diversify her inventory, adding additional products for sale such as silver jewelry, low-cost consumer goods, women's clothing and handicrafts.  By selling these products, she has been able to succeed with her customers, and her income has grown favorably.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a second loan of 15,000 lempiras to stock up on products that she doesn't have for sale, such as lotions, creams, shampoo, and new low-cost goods.  She hopes to offer her customers good service with products that they want.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own premises to provide a better appearance for her business and comfort for her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":926588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Maggy is 20 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past 2 years, Maggy has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Maggy has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like sugar for resale, and will help Maggy to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Maggy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nMaggy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Maggy's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

The cafe is located outside the city, has a small space and fits three tables and a kitchen.  One of the tables is located outdoors.  Siranush says that she has many customers during the summer months, but cannot sit all of them.  This is why Siranush needs a loan in the amount of $2,600 to spend on building and setting up an outdoor cafe, which will allow her to serve up to 50 customers.  Siranush's husband works at this same cafe as a chef.  Siranush's cafe is open until late evening and on weekends.  \r\nSiranush is 37 years old, married and has two children: a son and a daughter.  Her daughter is married and lives separately from the parents.  Siranush's son will soon go to the army.  Siranush's retired father-in-law also lives with them.  This is Siranush's second loan from the Nor Horizon organization.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1081163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda recibir capacitaciones por parte de la \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d para que en un periodo de 3 a\u00f1os su producci\u00f3n aumente. Dimas tambi\u00e9n se dedica a realizar trabajos de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda para tener ingresos extras y poder mandar a sus hijos a la universidad que se encuentra ubicada fuera de la localidad en la que \u00e9l vive.","en":"Dimas has been growing coffee for 23 years; he learned how to work this crop with his father when he was still a little boy.  He is currently 56 years old and with his wife, Minerva, does this activity which has been their main source of income to raise their two children who are currently students.  \r\n\r\nHis organic coffee production is of export quality and has a very good market price.  Dimas produces about 4 tons annually and hires staff to do so which is of great economic benefit for the families of the personnel that works with him.\r\n\r\nOne of his goals is that his land\u2019s yield increases so he needs a loan to buy fertilizer and plants to renew and also to do weeding tasks on his land.  He\u2019d also like to get some training from \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d [coffee cooperative] so that his yields can increase in a period of three years. \r\n\r\nDimas also works in construction to earn extra income and to be able to send his children to university which is located away from the community where he lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1080104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, coffee plants and do weeding in his property.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dimas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":12178.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810596}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T03:16:07Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":418643,"name":"Tebeal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tebeal, 48 years old,  lives in the community of Airport.

She takes care of additional family members (Grandchildren). She sells fish from home and sells to all categories of people but at retail. She has been in this business for the last three years. She has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Uganda Shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more boxes of fish.  Besides this fish business, she owns a retail shop. She works seven days a week. Her major business challenges include seasonality and transportation of boxes of fish from the landing site to her home.

esposo y sus 2 hijos en las edades de 10 y 12 a\u00f1os. All\u00ed tiene varios negocios, por un lado vende perfumer\u00eda y productos cosm\u00e9ticos en general  y su otra actividad productiva es la venta de gallina, cerdo, pescados y carne de res.  Ruth desde ni\u00f1a ha tenido el negocio como su vocaci\u00f3n principal, pues en la escuela aun recuerda, que era \u201cpilosa\u201d (como ella misma lo dice), pues vend\u00eda fantas\u00edas econ\u00f3micas a sus compa\u00f1eras de clases, llevaba al colegio binchas, aretes, pulseras etc. con las que le ganaba algo de dinero. En su mente siempre ha estado \u201cel ser independiente\u201d generando sus propios ingresos, por eso continu\u00f3 con su actividad comercial cuando termin\u00f3 de estudiar en la escuela. Ella para invertir, preguntaba a sus posibles clientes lo que necesitaban y as\u00ed mismo compraba esa mercanc\u00eda y la ofrec\u00eda,  para que estos se la pagaran en cuotas pactadas. En la actualidad apoya el sustento de su familia, vendiendo directamente lo que compra a proveedores en el centro de la ciudad y tambi\u00e9n mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos.  As\u00ed mismo toma pedidos de carnes, gallina, cerdo y vende en su propia residencia,  entre vecinos, amigos, familiares y referidos. Con este \u00faltimo negocio le ha ido muy bien y desea ampliarlo, porque cada d\u00eda crece su clientela. Esta es una de las razones por las cuales acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 una parte en carne, gallina, cerdo y pescado en mayor volumen y la otra parte la invertir\u00e1 en perfumes, cremas y productos de belleza, que llegaron en su catalogo con buenos descuentos, los cuales aprovechar\u00e1 para trasladarle los mejores precios a sus clientes. Su meta mas adelante en invertir en vitrinas, adecuar su espacio locativo, con el fin de ofrecer mejores precios, mejores productos y aumentar su clientela y con ello sus ingresos.  ","en":"Ruth is 43 years old and lives in the beautiful and historic city of Cartagena de Indias with her husband and 2 children (ages 10 and 12).  She has several businesses there, including one business in which she sells perfumes and general cosmetics, and another business where she sells chicken, pork, fish, and beef.  \r\n\r\nEver since Ruth was a little girl business has been her main calling in life.  Even though she admits it was a long time ago, she can still remember that in school she used to sell her classmates costume jewelry; she would bring hair bands, earrings, bracelets, and other items to school and then sell them to her classmates.  Ruth\u2019s goal was always to be independent and generate her own income, and so she continued with her business activities after she finished her studies.  She would ask potential customers what they needed and then would purchase those items and sell them; her customers would pay her in agreed-upon installments.  \r\n\r\nRuth\u2019s business currently helps support her family.  She sells products that she purchases from suppliers in the city center, along with items that she buys from special product catalogs.  She also takes orders for beef, chicken and pork from friends, family, neighbors, and referrals and sells the meat at her home.  Her meat business has gone very well and she wants to expand it, since her customer base grows by the day.  \r\n\r\nThat is one of the reasons why Ruth has decided to take out a Kiva loan.  This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and she will use some of it to purchase beef, chicken, pork, and fish in larger quantities.  She will use the rest of it to invest in perfume, creams, and other beauty products, which she will purchase with discounts from a catalog\u2014that way she can transfer the best prices to her customers.  \r\n\r\nRuth\u2019s plan for the future is to invest in display cases and adapt the retail space that she leases.  This will allow her to offer better prices and products and expand her clientele, and thus increase her income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1072271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
