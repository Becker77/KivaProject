She sells door to door and also from home where she has a small store.  She works every day because aside from going out three days a week to sell she also sells from home.  She sells on credit and collects payment weekly.  She goes to Huaquillas or to Guayaquil to buy merchandise every time she needs to.  She\u2019s been in business five years and she does very well.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more merchandise like pants, blouses, t-shirts and shoes.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for three cycles and is the group president; she likes it because of the support and group benefits.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that her little ones lack nothing.\r\n\r\nThe photo is of three members who were unable to be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":1075433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T22:30:06Z","loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Blanca Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexis Wilfrido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricio Leodan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3025,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":378.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1134.39,"local_amount":1134.39,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1134.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321477},{"amount":756.26,"local_amount":756.26,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":756.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209071},{"amount":756.26,"local_amount":756.26,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":756.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335389},{"amount":378.09,"local_amount":378.09,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":378.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391170}],"funded_date":"2012-05-07T12:47:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":417351,"name":"Cinthia Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cinthia, de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en un barrio de Choloma, Cortes, junto a su esposo y sus tres hijos de 2, 5 y 13 a\u00f1os de edad, dos  de ellos estudian en la escuela.\nCinthia, emprendi\u00f3 su propio negocio desde hace dos a\u00f1os, ella vende ropa interior, camisas, pantalones, achiner\u00eda, sandalias, cosm\u00e9ticos y otros.

The monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Adabiyat requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows, which will help her to increase milk volumes.

","en":"Maripat is 59 years old, a widow and raised two children.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in sales with an initial sum of 6,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, Maripat was able to grow her business to have a monthly income of 25,000 som (KGS).  Today, her merchandise selection is limited, and this is why Maripat requested a loan in the amount of 125,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her merchandise selection.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan partially into her youngest son's wedding and partially into developing her

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmmie hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Jaime, a driver, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nSusan operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also retails cellphone load cards for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1079610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-27T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-27T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":417360,"name":"Panales No 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Panales No 2, est\u00e1 conformado por once emprendedores que son de la misma localidad y poseen diferentes tipos de negocios, ya han venido trabajando con fundaci\u00f3n le\u00f3n 2000 en cr\u00e9dito que se les ha brindado y durante el financiamiento han demostrado ser responsable y con deseos de superaci\u00f3n, cada d\u00eda los emprendedores luchan para salir adelante con sus negocios para darle a su familia lo mejor.

She is married to Floro, a mechanic, and is the mother of two children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLydia operates a generator repair shop. Her husband is the main technician while she handles finances, accounts, inventories, and promotion. They offer all types of repair and check-up services. Her shop is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are business owners in the local community. She earns a minimum of 5000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare generator parts needed for her business. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLydia hopes her business will grow and dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education as a result of all of her hard work.

","en":"Jamiykul is 57 years old and a widow, she has raised her son.  In 2000, in search of a source income for her family, Jamiykul started her own business selling clothing, starting with a sum of 10,000 somoni (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work Jamiykul was able to grow her business to a monthly income of 6,000 somoni (KGS).

She worked for many years as a teacher at the Min-Bulak village school, and was awarded the title \"Teacher Emeritus\". In 1996, Aishake got involved in agriculture and animal husbandry as a means of acquiring more income for her family. Thanks to her hard work, her business, which began with 5,000 somi (KGS), now has one cow, two calves, one heifer, as well as ten hectares of irrigated land where she grows beans, perennial herbs, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Aishake has asked Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 somi (KGS) to buy bean seeds, fuel and lubricants. Aishake plans to invest the proceeds from the loan into further expanding her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1082009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fuel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Min-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-28T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-28T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aishake ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":30475.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071088},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30475.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754662}],"funded_date":"2012-04-29T04:32:53Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":419064,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon works hard to support her family.

This place is known for its beautiful beaches and here most of the residents are very hardworking and make a living doing work involving the sea.\r\n\r\nIn this place we met Francisca. She is 63 years old and many years ago her husband passed away, but from that relationship she had five children who are older and still live with her.\r\n\r\nTo make a living our friend undertook a small business more than 12 years ago. She has a small general store in her home.

With the small salary that she earns in her profession she cannot meet all of the costs necessary in the household such as paying a domestic employee.

her husband, so that she could work and earn her own income.  This activity consists of selling a variety of clothing for women and men.  She has been doing this for many years and has much experience, and has gained many customers due to her good treatment and the low prices of the merchandise that she offers.  She has been working with Ceprodel for six years, and they have approved 6 loans which she always invests in her business.  She is grateful for this unconditional support as it has allowed her to maintain her business and to train her only son as a professional so that he can support himself in his future life.

She and her mother-in law head the family's agricultural business, consisting of a milk cow from which Irma produces cheese, selling on average 20 kg per month at the local open market. The family also has a greenhouse, where greens and tomatoes are grown. Harvested products are sold at the  market as well.  Average total monthly income of the family is 800 Laris, including the pensions of Irma\u2019s mother-in-law, sister-in-law and daughter.<p>\r\n\r\nIrma is requesting a loan to start a small poultry business. She will purchase chickens to raise in an old hen house owned by the family. After three months she will begin selling eggs.

es una mujer que vive en Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, Ecuador un punto comercial id\u00f3neo por su ubicaci\u00f3n entre la sierra y la costa en el pa\u00eds. Con el clima c\u00e1lido, ligeramente h\u00famedo, se pueden apreciar en las calles los \u00e1rboles nativos que preservan la vegetaci\u00f3n en la cuarta ciudad m\u00e1s poblada a nivel nacional. Son sus reservas tropicales, la diversidad cultural lo que da al lugar un efecto m\u00e1gico para que la gente trabaje para su entorno. Roc\u00edo lleva ya 4 a\u00f1os con una tienda de barrio donde poco a poco ha ido apoyando a sus hijos en su crecimiento personal. Por situaciones de la vida, ella solo estudi\u00f3 hasta nivel primaria y sabe lo importante que es la educaci\u00f3n, es por esto que d\u00eda a d\u00eda junto con su madre trabajan para darles una mejor posibilidad a sus hijos. No es sencillo ser madre y padre a la vez, pero Roc\u00edo no se da por vencida. Con el apoyo econ\u00f3mico la meta de Roc\u00edo es liquidar la deuda que su socia dej\u00f3 frente a su tienda y quien ya no se encuentra con ella. Es adem\u00e1s su objetivo el hacer crecer su negocio para poder incrementar sus ventas e incluso colocar otra tienda en un futuro. Esperamos que con esta oportunidad los sue\u00f1os de Roc\u00edo puedan verse proyectados en la realidad. ","en":"\r\nRoc\u00edo is a woman living in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, Ecuador, a unique spot because of its location between the country\u2019s mountains and the coast.  With its hot, slightly humid, climate one can enjoy native trees along the streets that preserve the vegetation in the country\u2019s fourth most populated city.  For people who work in its environment, tropical reserves and cultural diversity create a magical effect.\r\n\r\nRoc\u00edo has had a neighborhood store for four years that has helped her to gradually support her children with their personal development.  Due to life\u2019s vicissitudes, she only finished elementary school and she knows how important education is which is why she, alongside her mother, works very hard day to day to give her children better life opportunities.  It isn\u2019t easy being mother and father at the same time but Roc\u00edo does not give up.\r\n\r\nWith economic support, Roc\u00edo\u2019s goal is to pay off a debt her partner incurred for the store; she no longer has contact with her.  Her goal is also to make her business grow to be able to increase sales and even open a second store in the future.  We hope that with this opportunity Roc\u00edo\u2019s dreams will become a reality. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1076170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay off an outstanding debt and to buy merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-04-28T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-28T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":393.49,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.02,"local_amount":45.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":46.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134388},{"amount":47.65,"local_amount":46.88,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":47.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092728},{"amount":48.78,"local_amount":47.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":48.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334521},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":58.56,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":59.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989653},{"amount":198.02,"local_amount":194.8,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":198.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564723}],"funded_date":"2012-05-19T10:50:24Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:20:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":419133,"name":"Tita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tita is 42 years old and married.

Her husband is Orlando, a security guard. She together with her husband manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of that sort. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be incorporating the loan in her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes her business grows more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Microfinance loans. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1079881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for recyclable materials needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-28T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-28T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2276,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606819},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2845.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095717},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2276.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359326},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303141}],"funded_date":"2012-04-28T21:05:53Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":419200,"name":"Wahida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wahida is a single woman with two school-going children.

She buys her ingredients directly from suppliers at a wholesale supermarket. \r\n\r\nMarcelina will use the loan to buy firewood to cook her tortillas during the winter season. One of her future goals is to install a shop where she can sell all kinds of groceries.\r\n\r\nMarcelina lives with her husband and her 18 year-old-daughter who is studying to be an assistant pre-school teacher.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza since the loan will enable her to invest in her business during the winter season. In addition, she notes that she has learned principles of accounting that she has been able to incorporate in her business.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a settlement in the south central part of Chile.

Her other two children study.  They are a united and very hard-working family. Marcelina tells us that her husband became sick due to cerebral palsy and that little by little he is recovering.  Marcelina's biggest desire is that he completely recovers so he is able to continue working. Since she is alone she is supporting the whole family.  \r\n\r\nThe main business of Marcelina is the production of raw milk, for which she has dairy cattle and sells the product to a business that works in the production of dairy products. The loan will be used to buy fodder to feed the cattle. This loan will help her a lot since she needed to accumulate fodder for the drought season. In this way she will not have a shortage of food for the cattle and will have higher production of milk, with which she will increase her income. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Marcelina is a very good mother. She gave her oldest son a lot of land as inheritance where they can build and in this way not be uncomfortable.  Another of her desires is that her two sons study until they have a professional

According to Crede estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested credit to start-up in the trade business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit George will open a butcher\u2019s store in a family-owned small building near to the local market. He will purchase a fridge and meat for resale. He will purchase meat from local farmers and sell it in the store. According to George\u2019s estimations the average monthly profit of the store will be approximately 500 Laris. The income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions. In addition to the above-mentioned the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1079096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase refregerator and meet for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kvareli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-04-29T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-29T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":418813,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is sixty-two years old.

Total average monthly income of the family is 350 Laris. According to Credo calculations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri requested credit for the start-up of a new type of agricultural business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Badri will purchase wooden materials, a polyethylene cover and will build the greenhouse. A small part of the credit will also be used to purchase cucumber and tomato seeds. Badri will grow cucumbers and tomatoes throughout the whole year in the greenhouse and will sell harvested products on Kutaisi market. The income of the family will significantly increase and Badri will be able to create better living conditions for his daughter and grandsons.
