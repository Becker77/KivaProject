He has a motorcycle workshop in the city of Caaguaz\u00fa. He is single and has one daughter who is a year and seven months old. \r\n\r\nRamon started working when he was a boy. He was about 8 years old when he started as an assistant in a mechanic's workshop, learning the mechanic's trade. About 5 years ago, he decided to work independently, and little by little he set up his own motorcycle workshop. Over the course of the years, he continued to strengthen and expand his business. With the earnings from the business, he always maintained his home, and with great effort he has succeeded in helping his family get ahead. \r\n\r\nRamon will use the loan he is requesting to expand his workshop, since he would like to offer more services, such as washing, so that he can give his customers more complete service.

She is married to Agapito, her business partner, and is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNancy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNancy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJosefa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Her stand is near the municipal courthouse so many people who need to transact affairs there come to her stand to make copies.  In addition to this and with help from her sister she sells underwear and slippers door to door and her sister helps her when she\u2019s very busy.  She\u2019s been in business more than five years and does very well.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy underwear, slippers and sheets of paper.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank since its founding and she likes it because of the support and benefits she gets from the bank.  Her dream is to have a large copying center in her own locale.\r\n\r\nShe had conjunctivitis which is why she appears in the photo wearing sunglasses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1076464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy underwear, slippers and sheets of paper.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-29T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-29T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321487},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209081},{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335399},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391180}],"funded_date":"2012-05-05T16:23:27Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":417808,"name":"Angela Ramona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo, ciudad hermosa de verdes  monta\u00f1as y paisajes  encantadores, conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os como la Ciudad Del Valle  encontramos el lugar donde se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal La Frontera De Urvavisa.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora  Angela es socia fundadora del Banco comunal y le gusta por la ayuda que le brindan los cr\u00e9ditos para salir adelante en su negocio y mejorar su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.

She is married to Ibarra, her business partner, and a father to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand in the coming years, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1080978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-29T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-29T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":958.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":8624.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8788.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095724},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":3833.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3905.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359333},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":3834,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3906.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303148},{"amount":114.58,"local_amount":4791,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4881.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355878},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":1917,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1953.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114016}],"funded_date":"2012-05-28T19:40:15Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":419625,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is a farmer working in Trinidad, Bohol.

He lives in Kvareli District, East Georgia with his wife, Raisata, parents and elder sister. Shamil and Raisata married a couple of months ago. All the family members are involved in the family agricultural business. They have a sheep farm with 40 sheep. Shamil\u2019s parents produce cheese from the sheep, which is quite expensive on the Georgian market. They sell it on the local open market.  In addition, the family sells lambs. Along with the above-mentioned, the family has five greenhouses where they grow cucumbers during the entire year. Shamil sells the harvested cucumbers on the local open market. The total average income of the family is 700 Laris per month.\r\n\r\nShamil requested a loan for renting a tractor to till the family-owned land, which isn\u2019t used at the moment for agricultural activities.

The loan will be used to buy more cooking oil, and will help Berna to generate greater profits and expand her business. Berna hopes that in the future she will be able to open a salon. \r\n\r\nBerna is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Razac is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala east region of Uganda. For the past two years, Razac has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Razac has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale and will help Razac to generate greater profits and pay house rent and other expenses at home like buying food. Razac hopes that in the future, she will be able to own a shopping mall. \r\n\r\nRazac is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Razac's future prospects by helping her to expand her business.

However, the celebration goes much further than that since it\u2019s a mixture of religion, pagan both Spanish and even African celebrations .

He is married and has one child. For the past 4 years, Emma has been working hard to manage his small business, which sells molasses that the locals drink. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Emma has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

One of them is still in school; another one does not study and helps her do the housework and grow vegetables for selling. \r\n\r\nKroeun has been planting cabbage and green peppers for about 20 years. The income generated from selling all those vegetables is for supporting her family and affording her kid\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nKroeun has been with VisionFund since 2011, and this is her second loan with VisionFund. She requested the loan to buy vegetable seeds. Kroeun strongly hopes that this loan enables her to grow good-quality vegetables so that she can sell them for a good price, and as a result, her family can live happily and in better conditions.

This region, in the middle of the Andes, has a very traditional community dedicated mainly to agriculture and livestock.  In Latacunga, which is at 2,800 meters above sea level, the climate tends to be cold, but in the subtropics, on the western side of the province, it is warm and humid because of its proximity to the coastal region of the country.\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked-about and popular festivals is the one for Mama Negra, which is precisely the independence of Latacunga.  Nevertheless, the celebration goes beyond that because it is a mixture of religion with pagan, Spanish, and even African influences.  For this reason the celebration has a lot of color that is represented in the traditional parade that takes place in September, on the 23rd and 24th, the day of the fall equinox.\r\n\r\nEdison has worked for three years raising animals, a job he learned from his mother.  He has not had the opportunity to study, so he only finished his primary education.  Edison has made the decision to become a professional driver.  In this way he will work driving heavy transport or in public or private service, and get greater income.  This job is very attractive to him because he likes to drive.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will get he will be able to pay for his course and his professional license, so he will be able to achieve his short-term objective.\r\n\r\nIn his free time he will continue working with his animals, for which he will have the help of his mother.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1078280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to be able to pay for his professional driver's license.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T06:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edison Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":661.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":49.79,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134393},{"amount":51.37,"local_amount":50.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":51.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092733},{"amount":572.84,"local_amount":561.52,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":572.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334527}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T16:45:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":420212,"name":"Sina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aged 48, Sina is a married mother of three children who all are still in school.

Therefore, her grandson Dulguun decided to have a small house for them. He is planning to build his house this spring and summer. Also he has a plan of making insulation for the walls.

Sauya is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi, in the Kampala region in eastern Uganda. For the past two years, Sauya has been working hard to manage her small market, where she sells clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Sauya has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Sauya to generate greater profits and pay her own school fees. Sauya hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big wholesale shop. \n\nSauya is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Sauya's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

For the past three years, she has been working hard to manage her small market, where she sells fresh food. To help expand her business, she has requested a loan for 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more food to sell, and earn greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Harriet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house in it. \r\n\r\nHarriet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Onesmus learned of Milango from his friends who are members of the organization (clients).\n\nHe is applying for a loan of 83,500 Kenya shillings to add to his savings so he has enough to purchase a three wheeler taxi, commonly referred to as a \u201ctuk tuk\u201d in Kenya. He believes he can get greater returns from this new venture while employing someone else in the motor cycle business. He also sees this as a means to increase the income for the family.\n\nOnesmus looks forward to purchasing a car in future for a taxi business within the city.
