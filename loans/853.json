She successfully paid back the loans with VisionFund. The previous loans have helped her improve her living condition and she is able to earn daily income of up to 21,000 KHR from her business. Her group members are applying for a loan of 1,000,000 Khmer Riels each. As the leader, Leng Sour wants to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes to increase her crop yields and earn more income so as to fulfill her dream of having a decent house for living in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1082894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leang Sour","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhenglun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nay ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1516125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315518950},{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1516125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940825}],"funded_date":"2012-04-30T17:34:57Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:04:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":420492,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka is a 33-year-old married woman.

She is 30 years old, and has two children, ages 10 and 3, with her husband. She adores them and they're her motive for always looking at life with optimism and she fights every day to give them the best, and above all a lot of love. Her husband works in masonry and with his income he contributes to the home together with Katia. Their house is located in the city of Pucallpa, which is found in our Peruvian jungle, where a great variety of flora and fauna live and which is, above all, marvelous.\r\n\r\nWhen Katia has free time she likes to play volleyball with her neighbors and friends from the neighborhood. Above all, when she is able she loves to eat one of her favorite dishes, which is the very tasty \"Arroz con Pollo\" (\"Rice with Chicken\"). She only studied through high school, but she would have liked to study pharmacy. This is why she works very hard so that her children can be better than she is.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day Katia works in her business selling food and soft drinks. She works for her business about 5 hours each day and can wait on up to 25 customers in a day. She believes that her business is going well because she has good seasoning and her customers feel at ease in her business and that's why they recommend it and always come back.\r\n\r\nKatia is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they have provided her she will be able to buy tables, chairs, and a second-hand refrigerator. With this improvement she'll be able to offer better service to her customers and she'll be able to have a very necessary tool for her business. In this way she'll be able to improve her earnings and keep on fighting every day to make her biggest dream a reality: to have her home built out of quality materials.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1078363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katia Zulianita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":152.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":155.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":163.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.84,"local_amount":152.11,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":161.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091324},{"amount":62.3,"local_amount":155.74,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":165.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222377},{"amount":65.28,"local_amount":163.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":172.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351195},{"amount":67.62,"local_amount":169.06,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":179.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108831},{"amount":143.96,"local_amount":359.89,"processed_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":381.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345006}],"funded_date":"2012-05-08T05:07:46Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":418971,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorena works hard to support her family.

The season of the highest demand of the year is from January to April.  She usually buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy wool vests for school.  This way Luisa aspires to sell the complete school uniform by adding the clothes that she makes herself.  One of the goals for her business is to hire another person to help her cut the fabrics and the patterns for the clothes she makes.\r\n\r\nLuisa lives with her husband, her two children, ages 25 and 21, her brother, and a nephew.  One of her dreams is to go on vacation so that she can rest.  Unfortunately, she is not able to do that because that is the time when sales are the highest.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the support from Fondo Esperanza.  The loan will allow her to have capital to invest in her business.  Regarding the trainings given at the communal bank meetings, she says they have allowed her to learn new strategies for book-keeping and managing her income.  The members of her communal bank are very committed to their businesses and to the practice of agreement.\r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is a city and district located literally in the center of Chile.  It is known as the \u201cCiudad Jard\u00edn\" (Garden City) because of the gardens and patios of some of the old houses in the city.  Also, it is considered to be the tourist capital of Chile.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1078258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool vests for school.

Jose says that he brings his harvest of beans and corn to sell in Managua because the markets are larger.  He has help each planting season from local workers from his same area.  Jose will use this loan to buy fertilizer and the necessary supplies for the bean planting season.

She has been involved in animal husbandry for 13 years, having started this business with a purchase of a heifer.  Thanks to Kalbubu's hard work, today her business contains one cow with a calf, five sheep with lambs, five goats and one horse.  The monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Kalbubu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow, which will allow her to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock

Thanks to Nurgul's hard work, today her business contains one cow with a calf, ten sheep with lambs and one horse.  The monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to 7,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows, which will allow her to increase milk volumes, and one bull for fattening up.

Oscar started his business 2 years ago with money he inherited from his mother when she passed away, and he chose to carry on by staying in the baking business.  His wife helps him with his work.  He sells his products in the city of Condega in the department of Estel\u00ed.  Oscar hopes to continue selling bread, since his business is going very well and it has generated enough profits to help him get ahead.  \r\n\r\nOscar is asking for a loan to purchase flour, sugar, yeast, oil, and the other ingredients he needs for making bread.

He lives in Tskaltubo District with his family: his wife \u2013 Sopiko, his nine-year-old daughter and six-year-old son as well as his retired father. The children go to local school. The only source of income for the family is a small-scale agricultural business. They have a milk cow and 200 nut trees on a family-owned plot of land. Sopiko produces cheese and sells it in the village. Nuts are sold in the village as well. The total average monthly income of the family is 270 Laris, including social assistance. According to the country\u2019s government assessment they are regarded as living under the poverty line and receive relevant social assistance. \r\n\r\nDavid requested credit to start-up a business trading fruit and vegetables. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit David will start-up a trade business. He will purchase fruit and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and take them in his own car to nearby towns for resale. As a result of the new business initiative the income of the family will significantly increase and the family will be able to improve their living conditions.  In addition to the above-mentioned in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

He lives in Telavi District with his 9 year old daughter, Nina, his mother and his 36 year old brother. Along with Levan\u2019s mother, his brother is the only income provider in the family. He works as an agricultural worker in the village and earns 150 Laris per month. The total average monthly income for the family is 250 Laris (Salary of Levan\u2019s brother and pension of his mother). According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nLevan has requested credit for re-starting an agricultural business, which was stopped 5 years ago because of lack of funding. Levan used to run a dairy farm. He had cows and the family was producing cheese and selling it. Now, Levan has requested credit for restarting the dairy farm. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions for business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor population, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Alex will start up the dairy farm. He will purchase 3 calfs and grow them. Calfs will be placed in an old cattle-shed, located in Levan\u2019s yard. After a half year, he will start production of cheese and sell it on the local market to dairy products retailers. The income of the family will increase by 400 \u2013 500 Laris, which will mean a 160 \u2013 200% increase. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve and, in addition to the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

Tamaz is the only income provider for the family. He works as worker in the village. The total average monthly income of the family is 200 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nTamaz has requested credit for re-starting an agricultural business, which was stopped 2 years ago, because of lack of funding. Tamaz used to trade with livestock. Now, he has requested credit for restarting the business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions for business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor population, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamaz will purchase 8-9 calfs and grow them. Calfs will be placed in an old cattle-shed, located in Tamaz\u2019s yard. After a half year, he will sell grown calfs for higher prices and get the profit. For the first 3 cycles, Tamaz will reinvest most of the profit into the business, to increase the turnover. The income of the family will increase and they will be able to combat the poverty. In addition to the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1083233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase calfs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Birkiani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":420740,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma is a married woman who has two children.

It is made up of ten indigenous, hard-working women who would like to improve their lives and those of their families.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are from Pinotepa Nacional which is home to good, hard-working people.  In Pinotepa Nacional, there are a lot of people who run small businesses.  It is a reflection of their hard work and their desire to make progress.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Adelfa Celsa who is 40 years old.  Celsa, as she is better known among her fellow group members, is noted for being a kind, hard-working lady.\r\n\r\nCelsa's business is selling Mexican snacks.  She has been in this business for three years.  What she most enjoys about her business is serving her customers and cooking for them with love.\r\n\r\nHowever, what Celsa does not enjoy is having to stay awake so late because she sells her snacks at nighttime, getting out her table and her dishes.  \r\n\r\nCelsa also works as a locksmith, making duplicates of keys.  She has been in this business for ten years.  She is very happy because her two businesses make her good profits and she is thereby able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCelsa is happily married to Gonzalo and the couple have three daughters: Araceli, Jessica and Liliana, who are their pride and joy.\r\n\r\nCelsa requested this loan to buy more ingredients for making Mexican snacks such as tomatoes, onions, garlic, cheese, 'quesillo' (soft cheese), chicken and tortillas.  She will use the rest of the money to buy more keys and padlocks for her locksmith business.\r\n\r\nCelsa tells us that she is very happy with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for helping her to continue to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nSocorro - who sells groceries.\r\nEsther - who sells Mexican snacks\r\nDulce Olivia - who provides a music service\r\nFlorencia Griselda - who sells Mexican snacks.\r\nOlivia Lucila - who sells clothing.\r\nIsabel Claudia -

She tells us that what she likes best about the job is going to sell her goods out in the different neighborhoods of her community.  What's not so likeable about her job are the occasions when she falls behind in filling her orders because of a lack of money, but she always tries to have them done on time anyhow.\r\n\r\nIn\u00e9s is a single mother, but, thanks to God, In\u00e9s has always been able to give her children a good start in life and always tries to give them a better education.  One of In\u00e9s' dreams is to keep herself in business and, in time, to grow it a little bit.\r\n\r\nShe asked for this loan in order to buy more blankets, perfumes, and cosmetics for sales to customers in wholesales and for personal use.  She is very thankful to the foundation for supporting her to achieve her dreams and give a better life to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\nMois\u00e9s \u2013 works selling perfumes.\r\nElvira Ofelia \u2013 works in clothing sales.\r\nMaria de Jes\u00fas \u2013 works selling perfumes.\r\nRosaelia \u2013 sells fruits and legumes.\r\nJanet Nayely \u2013 works in food sales.\r\nJuana  Catalina \u2013 works in clothing sales.\r\nAna Martha \u2013 makes and sells Mexican appetizers.\r\nRita Mayra \u2013 makes and sells embroidered goods.\r\n\r\nThey thank the foundation for helping them so that they can improve their daily lives and also for its support of single mothers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5025,"image":{"id":1073444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They have hopes and dreams of making their businesses grow more each day.  All of the members of the group are from Pinotepa Nacional, land of humble people and advancement.

One of her goals with her business was to expand.  So far she has been able to give classes in the high schools in her community.\r\n\r\nThe things she really likes about her business are the gymnastic routines set to music.  She enjoys them the most because they make a lot of human pyramids.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges that she faces is the continuation of her business.  On the occasions when she is not hired, she feels sad.\r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more spare parts for her taxi.  This way she will be able to continue providing service.  She also wants to use the loan to get other goods because she wants to sell clothing for children and adults.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMaria Elizabeth- sells shoes.\r\nIris

They are all from a small town called \u201cLos Tres R\u00edos\u201d (The Three Rivers) or better known as the \u201cLa Nueva Esperanza\u201d (The New Hope).  It is a beautiful place where there are many trees and a main river that is divided into three large rivers. The community celebrates El D\u00eda de Muertos\u201d (The Day of the Dead), a tradition where people honor the dead with offerings and the children go out with their baskets asking for offerings.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Fortunata Teresa.  She is 43 years old. She provides the services of her mill, where she grinds corn.  She has also been growing chili peppers for the past seven years.  Do\u00f1a Fortunata, as she is better known by her companions in the group, tells us that her customers come to grind corn in the mornings and the evenings because she only grinds twice a day.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her mill business is grinding the corn for her customers and giving them good service, and what she likes most about growing the chili peppers is planting and harvesting.  One of the things that prevent her from continuing her mill business is that sometimes the mill doesn\u2019t want to grind the corn and her customers despair because the mill is a little old.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Fortunata is requesting the loan to purchase more liquid fertilizer for planting and to purchase stones for her mill.  She is happily married to Se\u00f1or Seferino who is 50 years old.  They have two children, Rufino and Florinda, who they love very much. She thanks the foundation for supporting her so that her business grows more each day enabling them to have a better life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are as follows:\r\nCarmela who sells chickens \r\nMinerva who sells handicrafts \r\nAusencia who sells fruit\r\nAnayeli who sells snacks\r\nAlejandrina Paula who sells cheese\r\nM\u00f3nica who provides hair styling services\r\nLiliana who sells groceries\r\nRomana who sells bread\r\n\r\nThey are thankful to the foundation for helping them improve their lives and so enabling them to provide their children with a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1073366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase liquid fertilzer for chili pepper planting.

This area is known for a low standard of living with few employment opportunities for women, who take matters into their own hands by working for themselves. Many sell different items via catalog, such as undergarments, cosmetics, handbags, jewelry, etc., using a system of selling on credit. This loan will replenish Carmen's working capital, and she plans to use it to buy the same things that she sells to her customers and that they continue to demand, so she already has a market for products. One of her goals is to make some improvements to her home, which is provided by the Costa Rican government but has minimal amenities.

It is made up of 10 hardworking women with a desire to improve their lives.  Indigenous women, they all speak the Mixtec language.  They tell us they are proud of their language, cultures, and roots.\r\n\r\nThey are natives of a town called San Lorenzo.  For them their town is a land of culture, of artistic people, because the majority of the women work selling and making napkins, tablecloths, and huipiles [traditional woven blouses].  Before arriving at San Lorenzo there is a small river, R\u00edo de la Arena.  There are a lot of green trees and a small temple called Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Guadalupe, 25, who is known for being a happy and nice person.  She tells us that one of her desires is to improve herself and show the world her culture, her roots, and her language.  Lupe, as she is better known, tells us she has worked selling and making napkins for two years.  What she likes most about her business is combining the colors while weaving, creating true works of art.  Another thing she likes is it gives her good profits.  And what she likes least is that her hand tires, and sometimes her vision tires.\r\n\r\nShe tells us she sells her napkins on order because they are commissioned two weeks in advance for birthdays, \"quincea\u00f1eras\" [birthdays for fifteen-year-old girls], and weddings.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more materials to make napkins, such as quadrilles, colored thread, silk thread, and hoops.\r\n\r\nBesides buying her materials to make her napkins, she tells us she is going to acquire other goods because she is going to perform maintenance on her sewing machine.\r\n\r\nShe thanks the foundation for helping the indigenous people who want to improve themselves and make their roots known.  The other members are Roc\u00edo, who sells perfume; In\u00e9s, who sells chicken; Apolinaria, who sells bread; Elena, who sells grocery merchandise; Nemesia, who sells perfume; Ver\u00f3nica, who sells clothing; Ciria, who sells clothing; Celerina, who sells meat; and Catalina, who sells grocery merchandise.\r\n\r\nThey thank the foundation for helping people from marginalized communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1078362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make napkins and tablecloths.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lorenzo, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T05:20:04Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apolinaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemesia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celerina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1115.62,"local_amount":14625,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":14688.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317561},{"amount":743.76,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9792.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418946},{"amount":743.75,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9792.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568522},{"amount":371.87,"local_amount":4875,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4896.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399824}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T19:57:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":420920,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 35 years old and married with one child.

get ahead in life for themselves and their families.They are natives of a small town called San Juanito in the municipality of San Juan Jicayan, where the majority of citizens speak the Mixteco language. One of this community's traditions is the town party that is celebrated on July 24, which is Santiago Ap\u00f3stol Day. \r\n\r\nOne of the women is a seamstress and the men grow corn. One of the group members is Beatriz, who is 25 years old. She is a quiet and happy person. Beti, as her group members know her, tells us that she has been selling napkins and tamales for five years now. The different kinds of tamales she makes are: tichinda (black clams), shrimp, chicken, fish and pork ribs. \r\n\r\nThe people go to buy tamales at her house. She sells them 3 times a week and her customers already know on which days she sells them. What she likes most about her business is when she prepares the chile that she puts on the meat. It gives a good flavor without being too spicy. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that hinders her business is that she sometimes does not have the resources to buy the necessary ingredients to make her tamales.\r\nShe is taking out the loan to buy more ingredients to make tamales, such as: green chile, dried chile, tomato, onion, garlic, banana leaves to wrap the tamal in. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for its support and above all, for helping indigenous women. They don't discriminate against anyone for their language or for the way they dress. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are: Patricia - she sells embroidery, Cresenciano - she sells cattle, Ernestina - she sells fish. They are grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping all those people who wish to better themselves.

They raise and educate them in the home they own in the village of Yaroca, in the Palca district of the Tarma region in Peru. She has worked in agriculture for over 20 years. Aurelia says she enjoys this activity because of the freedom and independence it affords her. In all those years, she learned how to grow peas, potatoes, gladioli and corn, but she says that the ones she enjoys most are the flowers and the peas. \"Every season, I plant 3 sacks of gladiolus seeds\", she says. As for her husband, he owns two cars with which he works offering transport services in both directions between Tarma and Palca. Thanks to these two activities, they are able to cover basic expenses and better their quality of life. That is why in the future Aurelia hopes to buy more cars and thus offer transport to more towns that are far away. At that point in time her sons would be old enough to take up that activity. This is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, thus she gives her word that she will pay her monthly installments on time. She likes working with her village bank \"Las Truchitas de Yaroca\" because  of the solidarity between the members. With this loan, she will be able to buy 3 sacks of pea seeds with 1800 soles. The rest she will use to buy sacks of organic fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1053161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 3 sacks of pea seeds and sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:06Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187781}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T13:30:12Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":408423,"name":"Dalal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dalal is a 44-year-old married woman from Bani Kenanah, Irbid, Jordan and  a mother of six children.\n\nDalal makes dairy products and she is requesting a  loan of 500 JD to purchase materials needed for her home-based business.

She lives with her children, Ruthy and Alison, who she cares for with dedication by herself in her own house located in Chilca.  In order to raise her children she works every day from dawn to dusk.

He is pictured next to the rickshaw he will purchase.\r\n\r\nAhlam is a 27-year-old young married woman.  She is a mother of two sons and one daughter.  Her husband is employed with a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the family's costs and needs.\r\n\r\nAhlam is requesting a USD youth loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a rickshaw. This will offer to Ahlam's husband another work that will help in improving the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is considerable with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.
