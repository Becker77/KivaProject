A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is considerable with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Alpha requires a loan in order to produce more furniture to be put on sale.  In the future, Alpha plans to establish more work-shops in other areas and to train more boys as apprentice.  He is thanking you for your support.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1070464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy timber and improve on his carpentry work shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T07:02:00Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T07:02:00Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alpha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":409450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444640},{"amount":95,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":409450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537348},{"amount":95,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":409450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284815},{"amount":95,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":409450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338360},{"amount":133,"local_amount":560000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":573230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354734},{"amount":57,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":245670,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315575782},{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102362.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070075},{"amount":95,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":409450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339458483},{"amount":66.5,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":286615,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355753972},{"amount":123.5,"local_amount":520000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":532285,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862173},{"amount":71.25,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":307087.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390494718}],"funded_date":"2012-05-06T14:18:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:56:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":415167,"name":"Dionicio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dionicio is 41 years old.

She purchases her goods locally.\r\n\r\nFor cash or on credit, her dishes are sold to a customer base composed generally of students, young folks (unmarried), and especially laborers working at the factory. \r\n\r\nShe envisions making a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, help with family expenses, and pay the interest on the loan.

She lives with her husband and their children in Banconi, one of the outlying neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso.  Unable to attend school for social reasons, she quickly started 14 years ago, a small business buying and selling gourds and cookies. She is very sought after by her customers (mainly consisting of women) for the quality of her products.  In order to better satisfy the ever-growing demand of her clientele, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organization. She has already received several group loans via an association of women from her neighborhood (AMIDEF Association of Banconi).  She is currently on her second individual loan. Her first one was fully repaid.  She is asking for her second loan to buy 5 packages of gourds and 5 boxes of cookies.  She has a place at the neighborhood market where she sells her goods for cash, retail, and for credit.  She expects to earn an average monthly profit of 140,000 FCFA that will be used to help her husband take care of family expenses and to pay for the interest on her loan.  The remaining amount will be invested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1072952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various articles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T07:02:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T07:02:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safoura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-28T08:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":40011.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283252059},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411061},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449182},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502876},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268528},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498903},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102946},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243228},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":20005.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624800}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T16:45:43Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":415988,"name":"Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Benkadi est compos\u00e9 de six femmes mari\u00e9es et d\u2019une veuve, qui ont une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 35 ans, 3 enfants vivant toutes dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies dans le village de Kakiya, pr\u00e9fecture de Barou\u00e9li, R\u00e9gion de S\u00e9gou\nElles se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de parent\u00e9, de voisinage et d\u2019amiti\u00e9.

He lives with his wife and their children in a traditional family in Bougoula Hameau, about 7 km from the city of Sikasso. Mr. Yacouba, after operating a few businesses unsuccessfully, started a business buying and selling various articles. For over 12 years, he has had a store in front of his home where he buys and sells: corn, cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, soap, etc.  He is much sought after by his customers for the quality of his products.  To satisfy growing customer demand, he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organization about four years ago.  He has received five individual loans, all of which have been fully repaid. He is now asking for a sixth loan that will enable him to buy 10 tons of corn, 20 cartons of different cigarettes, 5 boxes of tea, 5 bags of sugar, 10 packets of powdered milk, 8 packages of candy, 15 packs of chewing gum, 35 packs of matches, and 10 boxes of soap. Sourcing from wholesalers in and nearby the city of Sikasso, he resells his goods retail, for cash and for credit, to customers from all social classes in his area.  With this loan, he expects to earn a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA that will be used to contribute to family expenses and to pay the interest on his loan. The remaining amount will be invested in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1072957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy grain and various articles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougoula Hameau ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T07:02:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T07:02:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125036.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411062},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":125036.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502877},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125036.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498904},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":125036.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243229}],"funded_date":"2012-05-30T03:06:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":416016,"name":"Sonagnon  Jeannette","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 48 ans, Sonagnon Jeannette est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de cinq enfants.

Her manner of selling is from door to door, and she also sells from her home where even her customers come. Dorys works three days a week and sells when she is not busy and does not work fixed days.

He is in very high demand due to the quality of his merchandise.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the demand of his ever growing customer base, he decided, a year ago, to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso from whom he has received three loans, all fully reimbursed. \r\n\r\nThus, he is requesting this new loan, which will allow him to go to Bamako to purchase 50 mobile phones of various brands, 5 boxes of cases, about 15 chargers, 25 packs of memory cards, 20 boxes of batteries, 10 dozens of various kinds of headphones, about 10 various watches and belts.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to make a monthly profit of 350 000 Francs CFA, which he will use primarily to increase his working capital, to participate to the household expenses and to pay off his loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1080194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase mobile phones and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T07:02:40Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T07:02:40Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamidou Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283252085},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411089},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449210},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502903},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268553},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84928.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498924}],"funded_date":"2012-05-27T02:40:41Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronique Fourment","image":442735}},{"id":419690,"name":"Adjovi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Adjovi est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 41 ans.

She lives in a large family in the Lafiala district of the city of Koutiala. She was not given the opportunity to attend school, which explains her commitment to commercial activities.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting several activities without much success, she now opted for the retail trading of saltwater fish. Saltwater fish are the most popular because they are more affordable than freshwater fish.\r\n\r\nTo increase her turnover, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution years ago. After six solidarity loans (group loans) all reimbursed without difficulty or delay, she is on her first individual loan.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy a hundred cartons of fish (for storage, in order to overcome the problem of shortage of stock which is common among providers in the community).

wife, and two children live in the village of Borzhava.  He sells groceries in this, his native village.  Currently, Yanosh is forced to rent his store, and it doesn't come cheaply.  Yanosh's business has its own advantages:  a diverse assortment of goods and affordable prices on various items.  At the present time, Yanosh has 20,000 hryven worth of inventory.  He has been in this business for 7 years now.  \r\n\r\nYanosh is planning to use the loan he receives through Kiva to remodel his house, dividing off one part of it for a store, and to get it equipped in time for opening.  Having his own store will give Yanosh the ability to leave the rented store, and thereby end the expenses of rent and public utilities.   The store's new location is very advantageous since it is located on the main street that many vacationers use to get to the beach in Summer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1066135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

in Kamenka together with his wife and grown children. He grows early vegetables in two large greenhouses on his property, while a third is used for seedlings. Alexander has been cultivating vegetables for 25 years since inheriting this business from his parents. He has initially invested 30000 hryvnia into the business, and spends 15000 hryvnia each year on seeds and plastic greenhouse covering.\r\n\r\nAlexander is hoping to receive a Kiva loan of 10000 hryvnia and invest it into construction of an additional greenhouse. One more solidly built greenhouse will significantly expand Alexander's operation, allowing him to plant more tomatoes and to continue further developing his business.

village.  He is involved in growing early vegetables in greenhouses on his plot of land.  Sergei has five large greenhouses and two separate spacious greenhouses for seedlings.  He has been independently involved in growing vegetables for 20 years.  150 000 hryvnia has been invested into this business.  The annual expenses for seeds and plastic amount to 60 000 hryvnia.  Sergei hopes to use the 20 000 hryvnia Kiva loan to buy coal and wood for heating the greenhouses and keeping the appropriate temperature for greenhouse conditions.  Sergei plans to invest 15 000 hryvnia into the purchase of coal and 5 000 hryvnia into the purchase of wood.  Because the heating system was only added this year, now the expenses for coal and wood increased.  In the future, Sergei plans to install another boiler in the greenhouses, so that it would be warmer and result in a faster harvest, and also plans to build another greenhouse.

She is involved in farming, growing early greenhouse vegetables.  Svetlana has two plots of land, four large greenhouses and two small ones.  She has been independently involved in growing vegetables for 23 years.  A large amount of money - approximately 300 000 hryvnia -  has been invested into this business.  Svetlana plans to invest the Kiva loan in the amount of 20 000 hryvnia into a purchase of coal with 10 000 hryvnia, a drip irrigation system with 5 000 hryvnia and also some materials to repair the greenhouses, specifically wood with 3 000 hryvnia and wire with 2 000 hryvnia.  Recently, Svetlana was able to partially install a heating system.  She now needs coal to heat greenhouse plants and also needs to complete two greenhouses by making necessary repairs there.  Svetlana constantly grows as an entrepreneur.  Last year, she bought a second plot of land and installed two greenhouses there.  She wants to install another one, finish building a garage and install a heating systems in all of the remaining greenhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1070495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coal, a drip irrigation system and materials to repair greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Dneprovka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T08:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T08:40:25Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2500,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-28T08:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20056.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594689}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T20:58:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-28T08:09:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":414954,"name":"Tatyana","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 - \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a. \u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u044b \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 7 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u0443\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432.

She also sells fast food at night from the front of her house. \r\n\r\nShe started with a loan MFP 2 years ago and she serves her customers alone in a friendly way. She considers her business to be very profitable because it brings her good earnings. She has a regular clientele and he products are very popular. She likes her business because it allows her to be at home and take care of things there and she can be with her daughter, whom she lives very much. She also likes the income it generates to pay for household expenses. She doesn't like it when it rains because it is difficult to sell her food and drinks because she depends somewhat on the weather to improve her sales, but this doesn't discourage her. Therefore, she has plans to increase the variety of products with energizing drinks and to improve her fryer cart for the fast food. This will be her 4th loan with MFP. She hopes for a small loan so she can meet her goals. In addition, she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people. With the 1000 nuevos soles she has asked for, she will invest in buying different brands of soft drinks as well as ingredients to make her fast food, such as potatoes, oils, flours and more. She will seek lower prices for her purchases by paying upfront. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1058243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy potatoes, oils, flours and other ingredients.

She gave up her job and decided to set up a general store so that she could care for her child and look after her home at the same time.  Now, with the income that her husband makes and the income her store makes, the family are able to cover all their household expenses and provide their son with a good quality of life and a good education.  Owing to the fact that her business is located on a main street, Claudia has access to a large number of customers.  There used to be no store in this area and her customers had to travel a long way to buy basic household products.  Claudia's store satisfies the needs of these customers and so it has become very popular.

She is looking for a loan that will allow her to fit out some bathrooms so that she can offer this service to customers in her store.

This is how he generates the income necessary for sustaining his household. This work has always provided him with enough income for his family, and things have always gone well with his vehicle. However, the motor is now broken down; he is hoping that a loan will allow him to repair it and keep working to bring in an income for his family.\r\nThrough this loan, Jose will be able to keep generating an income and his family's needs will be satisfied. Jose also hopes that his business will grow, and that he can achieve his dream of offering his three children the opportunity of getting a university

There, they sell all sorts of basic household food items. The main reason for the business change was Jesus' deteriorating health from selling on the street. Because they only had a small amount of capital to launch the business, it is not very well-stocked. For this reason, Jesus is hoping that a loan will provide him with the opportunity to buy more household food items so that he can offer a wider variety of products.\r\nThis way, his business will have a greater variety of household food products and therefore be more attractive to customers.

Javier decided to produce blades for brush cutters, which is a tool that wasn't easy to come by, or get at a good price, or a good quality. That is why he decided to produce them on his own and that's how his business idea came up. He made his first sale to a friend who tried it for a while, and as he realized the good quality of the product, he started recommending it to other people. That's how his product began to acquire more and more customers. Currently Javier continues to manufacture blades for brush cutters and from this business he generates the necessary income to support his home, where he lives together with his wife and his 4 children. Given that his business was set up with a very low amount of capital, and the market demand for his product has been very high, Javier is looking for a loan that will give him the opportunity to be able to buy more supplies such as metal sheets, blades, chains, among others, in order to be able to produce the units required by the market.\r\nIn this way, his business will have the possibility to continue to grow and his family will be able to live on a higher income.

Edison is married and has a two month old son and he always wants to provide a good quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age he learned field chores alongside his father and this was useful for him when five years ago he acquired his own crops which produce very good quality products.  Edison is currently 22 years old and he hopes that his crops will continue to be good and produce good quality products to offer to his customers at a good price which is why he\u2019s looking for a loan to buy manure, seeds, sprinklers, fertilizer and fungicide to produce his crops.\r\n\r\nEdison hopes in this way to continue making progress with his business and to have large crops so that he can generate employment to those who are most in need in the future.  In addition, Edison has the dream that the business will provide the opportunity to buy the land he currently farms so that he will no longer have to pay the high cost of the lease.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1060458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edison ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65141},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66975},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68860},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70798},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72791},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74840},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76946},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79112},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81339},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83628},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85982},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88402},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90890},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93449},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96079},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98783},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101564},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.23,"local_amount":58644,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58886.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326994},{"amount":77.18,"local_amount":136200,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":136762.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432382},{"amount":43.6,"local_amount":76930,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77247.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433048},{"amount":35.83,"local_amount":63236,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":63497.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640429},{"amount":91.43,"local_amount":161341,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":162007.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029510},{"amount":568.73,"local_amount":1003649,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1007797.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165634}],"funded_date":"2012-05-11T21:43:14Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":410820,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy personal hygiene products to offer to her customers.

She and her husband grow vegetables, and they are milk producers.  Her husband manages the crops because he has a bit more knowledge than she does in that area.  Amparo takes care of the dairy cows and milks them.  This way she contributes to the generation of income to support the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThanks to the good care that Amparo gives her cow, the cow has given her very good quality milk.  That is why her customers like her product so much. \r\n\r\nWith the thought of increasing her milk production Amparo is looking for a loan to buy a cow to increase her milk production.  Then she will be able to respond to the market demand.  This way her monthly income will increase considerably.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amparo hopes that with greater income her two children and her husband will have a better quality of life and opportunities to progress financially.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1061382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow to increase her milk production and respond to the market demand.

Bibiana is married and has a 12 year old son who is her motivation to work hard in her business.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, Bibiana started making wood items at home that she\u2019d sell to her friends.

This is how she then moved into a friend\u2019s carpentry shop where he let her us a small space there to make her items and this is how she gradually grew to have good business sales.  Currently, Bibiana has a business where she can sell enough to contribute economically to her home\u2019s expenses and to provide a better quality of life for her son.  Now, Bibiana plans to move production to her yard at home so is looking for a loan to buy work tools to make her products.\r\n\r\nIn this way Bibiana will have her own work tools to manufacture her products and will be able to do so in the comfort of her own home while caring for her son.

sons. He works with repairing engines for cars. For this, he rents 45 square meters large premises in a central part of the city. Roman's workshop is famous among the car owners in the city. He always performs work of excellent quality, as well as after-sales service to customers. \r\n\r\nRoman has been working in this area for 18 years. Currently, his net profit is around 5 000 hryvnia. Roman plans to invest his loan of 12 000 hryvnia in a lathe (a machine tool), which is necessary for his work at the workshop. With the help of the lathe, Roman can independently carry out restoration of the chassis components of a vehicle. \r\n\r\nRoman has started working in his own garage. Gradually investing in the business, he was able to move to more spacious premises, to acquire a bus for the work, and further to move from a two-room flat to a three-room flat with his family, and to restore the new flat.

One of his greenhouses has heating and is used for seedlings.  Aleksei has been involved in this business for 30 years.  He invested about 70 000 hryvnia into the business.  His annual expenses for seeds and plastic amount to about 25 000 hryvnia.  Aleksei plans to invest the 10 000 hryvnia loan into a purchase of seedlings with 5 000 hryvnia and plastic with 4 500 hryvnia, and also into an installation of a drip irrigation system with 500 hryvnia.
