She will breed the piglets in her farm to then sell them and thus gain a better income, in order to offer a better standard of living to her son. This is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, the institution through which Sandra connects to the Kiva community. During her first loan, she has stood out for being punctual with her repayments. She is very optimistic, and we wish her all the best with this investment, so that she will come closer to making her dream come true: to have a house of her own in order to grant a better future to her son.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1078315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la carpinter\u00eda hace aproximadamente 30 a\u00f1os, pues sus hermanos mayores se dedicaban a esta actividad y se la ense\u00f1aron desde muy temprana edad. Gracias a esto, aprendi\u00f3 a hacer productos de muy buena calidad en las carpinter\u00edas de su hermano, y posteriormente decidi\u00f3 montar su propia carpinter\u00eda aprovechando la experiencia que ten\u00eda en fabricar productos de muy buena calidad. El negocio que mont\u00f3 quebr\u00f3 al poco tiempo debido a los fuertes problemas de violencia que hab\u00edan en su municipio, y por esto se vio obligado a trabajar en diferentes carpinter\u00edas como empleado y gan\u00e1ndose salarios muy bajos. Hace aproximadamente 2 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 volver a abrir su propia carpinter\u00eda para probar de nuevo suerte y poder trabajar para su propia cuenta y gan\u00e1ndose un salario m\u00e1s alto que trabajando como empleado. Actualmente, Rogelio se encuentra casado y tiene 5 hijos y su carpinter\u00eda sigue creciendo gracias a la buena calidad de los productos que all\u00ed fabrica. Adem\u00e1s, su familia ha podido tener una mejor calidad de vida gracias al aumento en los ingresos de Rogelio. Con el \u00e1nimo de entregar pedidos que le han hecho sus clientes, Rogelio busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de madera para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sus productos.\n\nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 seguir entregando los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes y seguir teniendo un buen trabajo con un buen salario. Adem\u00e1s, si su taller sigue creciendo espera que con mayores ingresos su familia pueda gozar de una mejor calidad de vida y sus 5 hijos tengan acceso a una educaci\u00f3n de mejor calidad. \n","en":"Rogelio learned carpentry approximately 30 years ago because his older brothers did this work and taught it to him at a very young age.  Thanks to this he learned to make very good-quality products in his brother's workshop.  Later he decided to set up his own shop, making the most of the experience he had in making good-quality products.  The business he started went bankrupt very quickly because of severe problems with violence in the town, so he had to work in different carpentry workshops as an employee, and earning very low salaries.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago he decided once again to open his own shop, to try his luck again and be able to work on his own and earn a higher salary than working as an employee.  Currently Rogelio is married and has five children, and his shop continues to grow thanks to the good quality of products he makes there.  In addition, his family has been able to have a better quality of life thanks to Rogelio's increase in income.\r\n\r\nWith the intention of delivering the orders his customers have made, Rogelio is looking for a loan that gives him the opportunity to buy wood to make his products.  In this way he will be able to continue to deliver his customers' orders and have a good job with a good salary.  In addition, if his shop continues to grow, he hopes that with more income his family will be able to enjoy a better quality of life and his five children will have access to a better-quality education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1061487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to make his products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-01T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-31T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155318},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159690},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164185},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168806},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173558},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178443}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.15,"local_amount":151573,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":154437.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283327010},{"amount":91.74,"local_amount":159555,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162570.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432396},{"amount":96.24,"local_amount":167378,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170541.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378425},{"amount":97.47,"local_amount":169493,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":172696.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433063},{"amount":4.34,"local_amount":7540,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7682.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617513},{"amount":198.06,"local_amount":344461,"processed_date":"2012-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":350971.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323030110}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T20:36:13Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T14:42:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":414622,"name":"Aluel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aluel lives in bor.

She is separated from the father of her son; he provides them with no financial support. Seeing the need to earn an income, Luz Fanny decided to open a store where she sells basic items like candy, soft drinks, snacks etc. She's had the store for about six years and has used the income to support her son and provide him with an education. When she started the store she didn't have much capital so couldn't buy a refrigerator. Now she is seeking a loan to buy one so she can offer her customers items that need to be kept cold such as cold cuts, cheese etc.\r\n\r\nWith this purchase Luz Fanny hopes that her business will continue to thrive and provide her with a good income so that she doesn't have to worry about money. As well she hopes that her son will have a good standard of living and access to a good education.

Thanks to the good results he has obtained, Antonio has been able to capture a large customer base which has provided him with very good sales. His business has developed rapidly. Because his production capacity is currently very low compared to the market demand for his products, Antonio needs a loan in order to buy an industrial machine for making shoes; this will increase his production capacity and allow him to fill his customers' orders.\r\nThis will allow Antonio to respond to all of his customers' orders, and he will therefore have more income for his household. Furthermore, Antonio hopes that this additional income will allow his family to enjoy a better quality of life, and allow his four-year-old to access a higher quality education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1063087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She is in a common-law relationship with Michel, who is a merchant and the father of their three-year-old son Mois\u00e9s.  Jessenia lives comfortably with her partner and child in their own home which they purchased through much effort.  Her business involves preparing and selling sweets such as cakes and cupcakes.  She learned how to prepare these treats from her mother.  Jessenia makes delicious cupcakes, donuts, sweet rolls, and other items to sell from her home and as a traveling merchant.  She utilized a personal loan and her partner's savings to begin preparing and selling sweets.  Her business has been in existence for more than seven years.  In addition, Jessenia sells fruits, but the constant rains have halted her momentarily, so she will resume this activity later.  She is grateful that her business allows her to earn an income for supporting her children and that she has a career since she did not have the opportunity to finish her studies.  Now she wants to invest her capital and open a small grocery store in her home.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP organization.  She is grateful to have the opportunity to access a line of credit for accomplishing her goals.  In addition, Jessenia says that she feels comfortable with her Communal Bank because she knows most of the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  With the loan of 1,500 PEN that she requested, Jessenia will invest in the purchase of ingredients for preparing sweets such as sugar, oil, flour, starch, butter, and other items in bulk so that she will have better profit margins.

Two years ago, he was cultivating a \u00bd hectare of land. A year later, he was cultivating 1 hectare of land. Right now, he is working on 2 hectares of cultivated land. He was able to achieve this phenomenal rate of growth thanks to his supportive family, who work in the fields along with him. Sergei is especially thankful to his wife, who works full time as a nursing aide at a hospital and still manages to help Sergei out in the field. Her salary alone is not enough to sustain the family. \r\n\r\nSergei's biggest dream is to send his kids, who are 8 and 12, to university. In order to achieve this, Sergei needs to cultivate more than 2 hectares of land. He has 11 hectares of land but he cannot utilize all of it because of the limited farm equipment he owns. His family needs you to help them finance motorized farming equipment, which will enable the family to realize their full potential by cultivating their entire 11 hectares of land. In the near future, Sergei is hoping to purchase a small tractor to expand the variety of his crop. Currently he is growing vegetables but, after he purchases a tractor, Sergei hopes to grow grapes as well.

She is a single mother and the head of her household of two children, who are 15 and 17, because of her husband's death seven years ago.  Lucely has had to work hard every day in order to ensure that her children have what they need to get ahead and keep making progress in their lives.  Because she had to generate income for her household, Lucely started out by opening a business selling cell phones, which did not go very well for her.  After a few months she had to close it.  Next, she opened a business selling shoes, which she currently works at and which is still growing, thanks to the effort Lucely puts in every day.  She has achieved good sales in her business, mainly because of her good customer service, and this has allowed her children to have access to a good education.  As her business has been growing, Lucely is looking for a loan to give her the opportunity to legalize her business by paying for the necessary registration and to stock her business with more shoes to sell.\r\n\r\nThis will allow her to have fewer problems when it comes to continuing to sell her products and will thus allow her to keep growing more and more.  Also, greater income will allow her children to have access to a college education, which is Lucely's dream--to be able to see them become successful professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1063585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to legalize her business by paying for the necessary registration and to stock her business with more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-02T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-01T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35604},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36606},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37636},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38695},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39785},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40904},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42056},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43239},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44456},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45708},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46994},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48317}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.12,"local_amount":35200,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37445.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283327029},{"amount":44.31,"local_amount":73842,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78553.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432414},{"amount":23.69,"local_amount":39499,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":42019.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433083},{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":38270,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40711.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617530},{"amount":24.66,"local_amount":41099,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43721.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640456},{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":43376,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46143.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029538},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":41972,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":44649.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165653},{"amount":27.44,"local_amount":45723,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":48640.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548185},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":44455,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":47291.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098131},{"amount":57.94,"local_amount":96564,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":102724.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517405}],"funded_date":"2012-05-05T18:40:25Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:14:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":413312,"name":"Sareun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sareun is a 60-year-old construction worker.

Gabriel is married and has four children.  About three months ago he was laid off from his job, leaving his family without the only source of income they had for paying their household expenses.  On his own he learned how to prepare chorizo (sausages) and chuzos (grilled, skewered meat) and later he acquired a food cart where he sells these foods and now goes out every day to the streets of his town hoping to sell his food in order to earn the income needed to sustain his household.  This business has gone well for him, however, the difficulties haven\u2019t disappeared.

Do\u00f1a Pilar tiene una tienda de abarrotes esta vez ha solicitado el credito para surtise ya que le hacen falta varias cosas, como productos enlatados, leche, pan, huevo, detergentes entre otras cosas. Su tienda no tiene ningun nombre ya que tiene poco tiempo escasamente dos a\u00f1os, el reto mas grande que tiene que atravesar do\u00f1a Pilar es la falta de recursos para adquirir mas producto ya que tiene mucha competencia y si no tiene bien surtida la tienda es muy dificil que le lleguen los clientes a su negocio.\nNos comenta que la tienda la inicio ya que su pareja muchas veces se queda sin trabajo y de algun modo tenian que empezar un negocio donde les dejara recursos economicos para mejorar su calidad de vida y lo que mas le gusta de su negocio es darle un buen trato a los clientes.\nLa meta que tiene Pilar es que su tienda pueda estenderse y llegar a ser un minisuper todo esto lo hace para poder mejorar su calidad de vida de ella y su familia, la se\u00f1ora Pilar y el resto del grupo estan muy agradecidao ya que podran invertir en sus actividades, Teresa comprara pollitos y borregos, Luisa comprara borregos, Anita comprara Maiz para animales, Rosaura comprara guajolotes, Dionicia y Elodia comprara pollos y guajolotes.","en":"The group \"Barrio El Riito\" consists of seven hardworking and responsible women who are working together as a group with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the first time.  They chose the name for their group because they live near a small river that provides crystal-clear drinking water for the community.  On this occasion, the members elected Do\u00f1a Pilar to be the group representative.  She is currently 27 years of age and has been in a common-law relationship for two years with her partner Alvaro.  They have a son who does not attend school even though he enjoys learning.  However, they lack the funds to send him to school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Pilar has a grocery store, so she is requesting a loan to restock her business with products she is lacking such as canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, detergents, and other items.  Her store does not have a name, but it has been in existence for barely two years.  The greatest challenge she faces is not having the resources to acquire more products.  There is plenty of competition, so if her store does not have enough stock, it is very difficult for her business to attract customers.  Pilar says she started her store because her partner lost his job some time ago.  Somehow she found the means to start a business so that she could generate income to improve her quality of life.  What she enjoys most about her business is being able to provide good service to her customers.  Pilar's goal is to expand her store and turn it into a mini-supermarket with the intention of improving her quality of life and that of her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Pilar and the rest of her group are extremely grateful that they can invest in their businesses:\r\n\u2022\tTeresa will buy baby chickens and lambs.\r\n\u2022\tLuisa will buy lambs.\r\n\u2022\tAnita will buy corn for her animals.\r\n\u2022\tRosaura will buy turkeys.\r\n\u2022\tDionicia and Elodia will buy chickens and turkeys.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1078274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, and other products.

La tienda la abri\u00f3 debido a que los ingresos que generaba su esposo ya no eran suficientes para poder sostener todos los gastos de su hogar, y de esta manera ha logrado tener mayores ingresos con los cuales puede ofrecer a su familia una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para progresar. Debido a que su tienda la abri\u00f3 con muy bajo capital, Olivia busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar y as\u00ed surtir mejor su tienda.\n\nOlivia espera que de esta manera sus clientes aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1n encontrar una mayor variedad de productos en su tienda. Adem\u00e1s, Olivia espera que con el crecimiento de su tienda pueda ir cumpliendo poco a poco su sue\u00f1o de salir adelante con sus hijos y alg\u00fan d\u00eda tener su casa propia. \n","en":"Olivia is married and has four children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life and better financial opportunities.  For approximately one year, she has managed a general store where she offers household products, snacks, and sweets to her customers.  Olivia opened her store because the income generated by her husband was not enough to maintain all of the household expenses.  By earning additional income, she is able to provide her family a better quality of life and greater economic opportunities to make progress.  She started her store with very little capital.  Olivia seeks to access a loan so that she can acquire household products to restock her store.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes that her customer base will increase considerably as a result of offering a wider variety of products in her store.  In addition, Olivia would like to see her store grow so that she can gradually fulfill her dream of seeing her children succeed and of having a house of her own someday.

Thanks to this, Lennis has been paying for her studies and contributing to household expenses, so as to give her parents and siblings a better quality of life. Thanks to the good customer service she provides and to the quality of her products, she has many customers, and thus makes a nice profit every month.

She is in a common-law relationship with Juan, who is in the construction business.  They have four children.  Ana lives with her partner and two of her children:  Percy (age 30) and Juan (age 28).  They live in their own home, which they purchased with great effort.  Ana has a business of selling groceries, fresh fish, and bananas.  Every morning, Ana starts early by setting everything out on a table in front of her home.  She attends to her customers, who are mostly neighbors.  Ana started her business 20 years ago with her own capital, but she eventually kept growing as a result of the loans from MFP.  She manages her business with the help of her husband when he has free time and on his days off.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna considers her business to be profitable because her customers buy everything that she offers.  She enjoys her business because it enables her to generate an income to cover her expenses.  Ana has made the effort to travel to other places and meet new people, which will help grow her business.  She does not like the constant rains because they make it difficult for people to reach her house.  Her sales suffer as a result.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her 13th loan with the MFP organization.  Ana hopes to receive assistance so that she can continue with her goals.  She also feels comfortable working with her Communal Bank because she considers her group to be unified and supportive of all its members.  The amount of 1,000 PEN that she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of groceries at a wholesale price so that she can earn more income.  She will also buy fish and bananas to help generate more revenue since the prices of those products are also rising.

She has a 1-year-old daughter and, owing to the fact that her husband doesn't earn enough income to cover all their household expenses, she decided to set up her own business so that she could contribute financially towards the household expenses.  She started selling wafers and ice cream outside her home and has been in this business for approximately one year.  The business makes her additional income for her household.  Sirley's business has experienced difficulties because her daughter became sick a short time ago and she was unable to open up for some days.  This meant that her income was noticeably reduced and she has been recovering from the setback since that time.  Thanks to the fact that she works hard in her business, Sirley has managed to attract a large number of customers.  She is currently looking for a loan that will allow her to buy supplies.

She is in a common-law relationship with Isa\u00edas, who is a farmer and the father of their four children: Lu\u00eds (age 23), Paola (age 21), Isamar (age 18), and Anita (age 12).  Paquita lives with her partner and children in their own home.  She sells bananas during the day from a table that is set up in front of her house.  Paquita provides friendly and cordial service to her customers, most of whom are neighbors.  She also sells prepared food such as stews, \"juanes\" (chicken and rice wrapped in a banana leaf), pasta, and other dishes at night in front of her home.  Paquita started her business more than two years ago with a loan from MFP.  With the help of her partner, she has been able to make her business grow.  She considers her business to be profitable because of the good revenue that has been generated.  In order to gain regular customers, Paquita knows that she must invest time into managing her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe enjoys her business because it has enabled her to get out of financial trouble.  Because of their financial needs, Paquita decided that she would help her partner with the household expenses.  However, she dislikes the times when she is not able to sell all of her products due to spoilage, but these moments do not discourage her.  She has done a better job of calculating her purchases and acquiring only what she needs to avoid waste.  Paquita also has plans to grow her business and increase her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her eighth loan with the MFP organization.  Lately she feels that the financial support will help her follow through with her plans.  Paquita is comfortable working with her Communal Bank because she considers her group to be unified and supportive.

In this way she can continue expanding her business and offer her clientele good service. \r\n\r\nAlso, Gloria hopes that her son has the opportunity to have a better education and she wants to provide him with a stable economic future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1072262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy personal care products in order to meet the large orders that her clients have made","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Retiro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":65148},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66981},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68866},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70803},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":72795},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":74843},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":76949},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":79114},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81340},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83628},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85981},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88400},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90887},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93445},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96074},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98777},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":101556},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":418042,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma raises hogs in the village of Disimuray.

For this reason he always looks for better income and better opportunities for progress for his wife and their four children.  Previously Arbey worked as an employee on a farm where they raised some crops.  From there he began to learn the activity of agriculture; later he studied some agricultural techniques and that is how he began to cultivate sporadically from his home some vegetable crops.

His wife does household tasks and cares for the children. Carlos has been a coffee farmer and seller for 12 years. He learned the job from his father with whom he worked since he was a child. He enjoys the business and now owns his own plantation. His work schedule is from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m., however during coffee harvest season, he works full time and does not follow a particular schedule since there is so much work to do. \r\n\r\nCarlos is applying for this loan in order to purchase fertilizer because he needs it to improve his land so that it will yield a good harvest. The loan would help greatly since previously he had to pledge his coffee to intermediaries beforehand, who paid him a lower price and took advantage of his need for money before the harvest. One of his dreams is to produce more coffee and thus generate higher sales. This is his first loan with FAMA and he expects to make all of his payments on time.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1072466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":416078,"name":"Florcita Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Florcita tiene 40 a\u00f1os, naci\u00f3 en Jipijapa recinto de Manab\u00ed.

She is married to Manuel Loor and has two children ages 5 and 8.  Since her husband is a factory worker and lives in Guayaquil she left her native land.  8 years ago they began construction of their house, which they have not been able to complete for lack of economic means.  She decided to begin her business out of necessity since she did not have work.  At the beginning she sold candy, snacks and sodas, but over the years her business prospered.  Today she no longer sells from the living room of her home.  She has a shop, purchased a copier and started her bazaar.  She tells us that she has a schedule from 6am to 10pm, and that she is tired but it allows her to be with her children who attend school.  As her husband is a factory worker she works alone.  This worries her since she has become vulnerable to delinquency.  The loan will be used to purchase products for the store, like stationary and candies to increase business.  Her dream is to increase sales so that her income will allow her to finish constructing her home.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1073147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products for the store, like stationary and art products and candies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-05-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-02T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florcita Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1557.01,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":118.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":122.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":132.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":136.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":138.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":142.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":162.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.6},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":418448,"name":"Tes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tes is 35 years old.

She lives in the Prey Chor district of Kompong Cham province. She usually works along with her husband to manage the maintenance of the rice field, earning a suitable income to raise their family of six children. She loves doing this type of business since she is a low-educated woman who only finished primary school level. She, together with her husband, has committed to work hard because they want to provide a good education to their children. Presently, five of them are married and have independent lives, living separately around the province, while the remaining one is still a student.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a vehicle for home use, Hul is experiencing difficulties in using other transportation services. To better her situation, she is asking for a loan of USD 1,300 to purchase a motorcycle to meet the needs of her family. This loan will help her family avoid the expenses of transportation services.

After some time he was able to become independent and began to cultivate his own plantation. The work schedule is varied. During the harvest season one works hard without rest. \r\n\r\nTo date, the difficulties that Marlon has faced are the scarcity of manual labor for the coffee harvest, since everyone is doing the same work at the same time. Another inconvenience is the transferral of the coffee to the point of sale, since due to the bad state of the roads\u2014a product of the winter rains\u2014it is difficult to transport the product. \r\n\r\nMarlon intends to use the loan he is requesting to buy fertilizers and pay the workers who maintain the plantation. The loan would help him considerably, since before he had to pledge the crop to intermediaries who would take advantage of him to pay a low price for the coffee. One of Marlon's goals is to introduce modern technology to his plantation and to have the proper tools to expedite the work.

He tells us that his hometown is very beautiful and, since it's a coastal town, it has wide and charming beaches. Salinas is one of the beaches in Guayas and it's very well-known among tourists. Its climate, beaches, inhabitants and gastronomy are a pleasure for both foreigners and locals. Guido first started working as a traveling salesman when he was 17 years old. He very much enjoys talking and being proactive, and for that reason he decided to become independent two years ago. He currently owns a store in the central area of La Libertad where he sells beds, mattresses and living and dining room suites.
