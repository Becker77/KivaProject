For that reason he puts in effort every day in his locksmith's shop, seeking better financial opportunities for his household. He's been working in this trade for about 40 years. He learned from a very early age and kept his job for a long time. Due to the fact that his job didn't pay well, he decided to start his own locksmith workshop and has been doing that for 22 years, improving his family's quality of life. In his workshop he offers products like doors, windows, bars, decorative items and other things, and thanks to the quality of his work he has very good sales. With the desire to upgrade his machinery, Orlando is seeking a loan to buy a new polishing machine because the one in his shop is obsolete.\r\n\r\nThis way he will continue to offer good work to his customers and can keep his monthly sales up. Orlando dreams of being able to take care of his wife and 2 children, giving them a good university

Two of her children work: one works in the construction industry and her daughter does domestic work.  Thanks to God, they do not have any health problems but they do have financial problems as Marlen would like to have a nice, painted house made from blocks (her house is currently made from planks of wood).  She would also like to have better financial solvency so that she can help her children with their studies and offer them a better future.  Twelve years ago, Marlen started working with a small grocery store.  Then, a family member helped her to acquire premises so that she could start a business selling fruit and vegetables.  She currently works in this business.  She works together with one of her daughters who helps her to serve in the business.  Her opening hours are 8.00am to 6.00pm.  One of her advantages she has is that she has a lot of customers but sometimes her produce spoils and she loses her investment.  \r\n\r\nMarlen needs the loan that she is requesting to buy fruit and vegetables such as watermelons, grapes, mangoes, bananas, avocados, melons, chilis, onions, tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, lettuce, etc.  With the support of this loan, Marlen will be able to stock her business and continue having a source of income with which to support her children.  This loan will be really helpful to Marlen's family as she constructed her house from planks of wood, with the foundations made from blocks.  She will be able to gradually finish converting her house to blocks.  Her goals are to expand her business and have her own premises.

About one year ago, Catalina opened a store selling natural health products, such as capsules made from plants and roots. Her loan will help Catalina purchase more products from a wholesaler in Cusco.

They are a very united, hardworking family.  Juan grows coffee, beans and corn to sell, an activity he\u2019s been doing for 20 years.  He learned how to work while still very young because his mother was single and needed help to support the family.  Juan gradually saved up to buy a piece of farmland and be able to plant and this is how today he has his coffee farm where he also plants beans and corn.  His work schedule is 5am to 2pm and when it\u2019s harvest time he works full-time.  One of Juan\u2019s advantages is that he already has sellers for his products so they sell quickly.\r\n\r\nThe loan Juan is requesting is to buy fertilizer, cement and rebar because he needs to build some tanks and canals to gather the coffee beans.

His wife sells groceries, while he works in agriculture and cultivates coffee. He started growing coffee on his own initiative and effort, because he was eager to get ahead. \r\nHe works daily from 5 am until 4 pm, and does so along with some of his children. During the harvest season there is full time work and there is so much work that he can't cope with all of it. The difficculties that have risen so far are that during the coffee cutting season there isn't enough manpower available, so the coffee beans fall off and he suffers some losses. At times, he does not have enough money to pay for labor.

They are working hard to change their home structure, and they decided to take a loan with Esperanza to start improving their house. With this loan they will buy concrete blocks, cement, and other building materials. They will make and fix some of their house walls. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International is running a program where most of their good clients -- those who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their businesses and have shown fidelity in their groups -- can take loans to improve their house structure, while running their businesses and attending to their group meetings.\r\n\r\nCarmen thanks all of you for your support!

She learned this work from her husband, and he inherited it from his parents. They have discovered that this kind of work gives them a good profit margin, since sales are good in their area. In spite of this, they would like to increase this profit margin; they cannot buy as much as before, since they don't have the money to do so. \r\n\r\nShe buys the products in the districts close to the place where she lives, from various people. However, since the sale price is not the same, she has to buy in this way and later sell as a considerable price so she will not make a loss at the time of the sale. To buy her dairy products, she goes on foot to the vendors, since there is no public transportation in this place. At time she has to walk for kilometers to reach their homes, and later she comes back carrying the products herself. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in buying greater quantities of cheese, curds and cream. Currently, she can only buy 75 pounds of cheese, 30 pounds of curds and 50 bottles of cream per week, and Arcadia would like to buy the double amount of each product, because she has a lot of customers and she is not able to stock up because of a lack of funds. With this investment, she will improve her income and her sales will increase, because her customers will be satisfied since they will always find fresh products at her home. \r\n\r\nArcadia wants to have a better quality of life, with the sale of dairy products to help her husband cover all of the expenses of their household. Both are at an advanced age, but they still have a determined spirit to keep working. Because agricultural work is very heavy, the sale of dairy products is easier for her, and they also benefit from the help of the municipal authorities, who have given them a shop where they can sell their products.

The problem he faces is that there is no access for vehicles, since he lives on a mountain, and it is difficult to transport his products. Jos\u00e9 is requesting the loan to buy compost and fertilizer and to pay for labor during the coffee harvest season.

He and his family live in the community of Las Ca\u00f1itas, in the department of Olancho. \r\n\r\nTen years ago Wilson began planting coffee with support from his parents who gave him the land to plant coffee, corn, and beans. He currently makes his living harvesting basic grains. He works alone and his work day lasts from 6:00am to 1:00pm. During the harvest season he works full time. Due to the quantity of work there is, he needs to find employees because he cannot do it alone. The advantage is that he enjoys good coffee bean production even though he is paid a low price for his product. \r\n\r\nWilson needs the loan he is requesting to invest in the purchase of manure, to clear the land, and to improve the farm.

Desde hace aproximadamente 5 meses quiso volver a abrir su tienda general, pero debido a la falta de capital en el momento no puede ofrecer a sus clientes una gran variedad de productos. Es por esto que ahora Luz Margarita busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para as\u00ed surtir su tienda y poder ofrecer a sus clientes una mayor variedad de productos de modo que pueda incrementar sus ventas considerablemente.\nDe esta manera su negocio seguir\u00e1 creciendo poco a poco y retomar\u00e1 el gran negocio que ten\u00eda antes, de modo que su familia podr\u00e1 seguir gozando de una buena calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"Luz Margarita is a hardworking person who has had to overcome great adversities in her life along with her husband, who has been instrumental in offering a good quality of life for their two children.  Approximately seven years ago, Luz Margarita opened a general store so that she could contribute financially toward the household expenses since her husband's salary was insufficient.  However, she was obligated to close her store about a year ago because of family difficulties.  From that point she experienced major challenges.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz Margarita reopened her store five months ago, but she lacks the capital to offer her customers a wide variety of products. For this reason, she is now seeking the opportunity to access a loan so that she can buy household products to restock her store and provide her customers with a greater variety of products.  This will increase her sales considerably.  As a result, her store will continue to grow gradually and return to the successful business that it once was.  Her family will also enjoy a good quality of life and greater financial opportunities to make progress.

Her husband works in agriculture. They live in the community of Patuca in the department of Olancho. She began her business because her father gave her a plot of land so that she could start to cultivate coffee beans and she has gradually bought more plots of land to farm on and she now has a more extensive plantation. For the past 5 years she has been sowing coffee. She works with her husband. Her working hours vary, sometimes she works all day and other times she only works half days. The only difficulties she faces are that the buyers only pay what they want to for the product and this affects her finances. Also during harvesting season labor is limited and there are almost no workers to pick the coffee so they lose a large part of their harvest.

El pr\u00e9stamo que Mayra esta solicitando lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de fertilizantes para el mejoramiento de la finca. Uno de los problemas que se les presentan es en la temporada de invierno que debido a tanta lluvia el grano de caf\u00e9 se cae y esto les ocasiona perdidas. Una de sus metas es seguir cultivando en mayor cantidad para que en un futuro poder emprender otro negocio que le genere ingresos adem\u00e1s del caf\u00e9. Este es el primer financiamiento que obtiene en FAMA y espera cancelar sus cuotas puntualmente.","en":"Mayra is 21 years old, married, and has no children. She and her husband live in the community of Patuca, Olancho. Her husband works in the fields and is very responsible with his obligations. Mayra works tending the home and also works in the field with her husband. They are a hard-working and united family. They work together and this makes them get along well as a couple. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of their dreams is that someday they will be able to have children and provide them with a good education and not have them lack anything financially, or in health or education. Mayra began her business with her father's help. He taught her how to farm the land. Little by little, with the help of the laborers who harvested her land and then after marrying, with the help of her husband, began to grow and care for coffee beans. They are both currently working raising coffee beans and they work full-time. This work is their only source of income. Mayra is asking for a loan to be used to invest in fertilizers to improve the farmland. One challenge they face is that during winter there is too much rain and the coffee beans fall off and sometimes are lost. One of their goals is to keep growing more so that in the future they can start another business to generate income in addition to the coffee. This is the first loan she has gotten from FAMA and she expects to make the payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1078255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-05-04T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-03T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Gianny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-30T08:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15244,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489050}],"funded_date":"2012-05-04T18:14:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-30T08:48:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":420702,"name":"Abduljbar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abduljbar is a 30-year-old married man who has three children who live together in Taiz, Yemen. \r\n\r\nHe got some land from his father and then he built a house in the village.
