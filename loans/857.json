He lives with his mother and brothers. He used to be unemployed but his uncle entrusted him with two used minivans to be used as an income source. Ronal then started working as a minivan driver and has employed one more assistant to drive the second vehicle. The assistance from his uncle really helps him in meeting his and his family's needs. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Ronal cannot afford to produce more income recently as one of his minivans is broken. Ronal wants to repair it soon but the limitation of capital has prevented him from doing so. Therefore, Ronal is requesting a loan of 4,500,000 Rupiah (IDR) from TLM.

She also works in a supermarket.  She has several customers there as she offers her work colleagues the different styles of shoes that she sells.  She also sells her products to neighbors and family members.  Her customers recommend her to more and more people and, in this way, both her customer base and her profits increase.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that Elizabeth most likes about her business is that it makes her good profits and she is very successful in selling her merchandise.  Above all, there are many offers for her customers and herself.  However, there is also something that she does not like about her business.

their fellow countrymen\u2019s lives.  All are from Pinotepa Nacional.  For them, their location is a land of humble, hardworking people with the desire of improving their children\u2019s future.  The local style of dress is huipil [traditional embroidered blouse] and apron and the men wear unbleached cotton pants.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Agustina, 49.  She\u2019s noted for being an unassuming, humble person with a desire to help her family.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Tina, as her group members call her, has been making \u201cmemelitas de manteca\u201d (Mexican snack) for the last 20 years.  For her, her business is one of the best gifts God has given her; she works with love and dedication.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she rises very early, at four in the morning.  She washes her corn and grinds it for masa since she has a mill at home (shown in the photo).  Then, she takes her lard and coffee to the market accompanied by her husband, Javier, and her daughter, Guadalupe.\r\n\r\nArriving at the market she prepares the dough in a large tray and adds the lard and salt.  Then she puts the coffee on the fire while she prepares the memelitas de Manteca.  Her daughter, Guadalupe, goes out to sell them among the stands in the market.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning one of her coworkers, Audelia, arrives to help her make the memelitas while Do\u00f1a Tina heads out to sell them at the entrance to the market; she takes her tray of memelitas and her jug of coffee.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she enjoys her business very much; it\u2019s something that she loves very much and that has helped her provide a better life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more ingredients to make the memelitas like: two sacks of sugar, one bag of coffee because she sells coffee to go with the memelitas, ten bags of corn, three tubs of lard and two loads of firewood.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she\u2019s very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping all the indigenous people and workers who earn their daily bread with their work to provide for their families.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nAlejandrina-sells food.\r\nAna Laura-sells soft-drinks.\r\nGuadalupe-sells Mexican fast food snacks.\r\nZeferina-sells perfume.\r\nAudelia- sells Mexican fast food snacks.\r\nGerman Enrique \u2013sells costume jewelry.\r\n\r\nThey thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping all the humble, hardworking women with the desire to improve their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1079166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The group is characterized by the hard work and dedication the members put into their businesses, with one single goal: getting ahead for the good of their families. Jesusa has two children who are still minors, so that she divides her time between caring for them and working in her new business providing tailoring services. She has been in this business for more than six months. She started it with her sister because they did not have sufficient income to maintain their household. Apart from this, she works for a company providing cleaning services. With this work, she has been able to help her common-law husband cover the expenses and make payments such as the school fees for their children, the rent on their home, and other expenses of their household.

He has a two hectare parcel of farmland where he\u2019s growing lemons that he harvests weekly producing additional income for him.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the requested loan is 4500 new soles that he will use to buy nutritionally balanced feed for his livestock and to buy a mototaxi to transport his products so that he can sell them at a better price thus improving his living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1080211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-04T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-03T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Santos Remigio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":137.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":149.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":163.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":161.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":182.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":178.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":181.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":196.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":199.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":201.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":212.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":219.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":225.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":234.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":238.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":258.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":257.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":421176,"name":"Altanbagana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Altanbagana is a 34-year-old man who lives with his two children and wife in an outer ger district without basic infrastructure in the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Sareub has been in this business for almost five years now. She manages to raise about US $8 per day from her current business, of which she is able to save only around $2 each day.

They live in a community called La Mesa center, which is the reason they chose the same name for their group.  This community is known for having a Monarch Butterfly sanctuary and is a place where people come from various places as tourists.\r\n\r\nDon Rodolfo who is the representative of the group is 51-years-old, married to Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Juana, and together they have four children who still depend on them because they go to school.  Don Rodolfo has a carpentry shop that is named \"El Membrillo\" and has been around for 25 years.  He started his carpentry shop because in Mexico City he worked as a carpenter and learned many things.  That is why he decided to put one in his house and thus be able to spend more time with his family, reduce their cost increase, and be able to pay off their household expenses.\r\n\r\nThis time he has asked for the loan to buy raw materials like wood, paint brushes, paint, varnish, etc.  The biggest challenge that Don Rudolfo faces is that he often does not have the tools he needs to fulfill all the orders that his customers have placed with him.  Many times he has not been able to comply with the orders in such a way that his customers do not like the design and they complain that it is very simple because he has not finished it the way they wanted.  This is why it is increasingly difficult for him to succeed in his business.  In his carpentry shop he makes all kinds of furniture for the home, like cradles, wardrobes, tables, built-in cupboards, small furniture, etc.  \r\n\r\nHe says, \"The loan has helped me a lot. Thanks to it I have been able to buy more material although my biggest goal or hope would be to have more up-to-date machinery to satisfy my customers so that they would want to return to order more furniture from me; to be able to improve the quality of life for my children and wife.\"\r\n\r\nDon Rodolfo and the rest of the group are grateful to FRAC and Kiva since they all will be able to invest in their work.  Don Jes\u00fas, Pedro, and Juvenal will be able to invest in the maintenance of their taxi; Do\u00f1a Cecilia will be able to invest in the remodeling of her restaurant; Lorena will invest in the purchase of groceries; Agustina will buy lambs; and Martha will buy calves - all in order to improve the quality of life of each of their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1079233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials like wood, paintbrushes, and varnish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La mesa,  san Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-04T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-03T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvenal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317564},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418950},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568526},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399827},{"amount":745,"local_amount":9800,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407547}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T04:04:33Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":417337,"name":"Asuncion Agustina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Asunci\u00f3n de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera vive con sus tres hijos en la casa que renta ubicada en un barrio de la ciudad de San Lorenzo, al sur de Honduras, sus hijos van al colegio y su hija ya esta casada, Do\u00f1a Asunci\u00f3n se dedica desde hace unos 15 a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de golosinas como ser: tacos, enchiladas, carne  azada, pastelitos y pan, su venta es en su casa y tambi\u00e9n de forma ambulante en los barrios aleda\u00f1os a su comunidad.\nDo\u00f1a Asunci\u00f3n solicita 8,000.00 lempiras para la compra de harina, le\u00f1a, huevos, leche, m\u00ednimo verde que son la materia prima para preparar el pan y las golosina, con el pr\u00e9stamo Do\u00f1a Asunci\u00f3n pretende mejorar sus ingresos y por con esto mejorar la calidad de vida de ella y su familia.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Do\u00f1a Asunci\u00f3n es superarse en su negocio y que sus hijos vivan mejor y estudien, tambi\u00e9n su sue\u00f1o es tener su propia casa.\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - Marzo del 2012\n","en":"Sra.

She purchases these vegetables around her village and resells them at the market. Sometimes she needs to go to the farthest village in order to get fresh vegetables to be sold. Yumina does this solely to meet the needs of her family.\r\n \r\nYumina plans to send her eldest daughter Helga to university this year. In addition, she realizes that to implement her dream she will need a bigger amount of money. Yumina is thinking about her business improvement by increasing the quantity of vegetables that she sells.  So she is taking part in TLM through the Individual Lending program and is requesting IDR 5,000,000 for business capital.

She is requesting a loan to buy Swarovski crystals, imitation pearls, beads, glass tube beads, natural stones, wire, nylon thread, copper thread, staples, hooks and clasps for making bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc.  She says that she makes these products and sells them at the university where she is studying.  She says that she has been making her creations for more than three years.  She started the business in order to support her parents in covering her university expenses.  She is studying to become a teacher and is in her third year of her degree.  She says that she is very happy and proud to be able to help her parents because her university expenses are high.  She says that she buys all her materials in the state of Jalisco because there she is able to buy them for a lower price and so can earn a little more.  She says that, thanks to the loans she has received, she has been able to gradually grow her business.  In the past she only sold bracelets and necklaces but now she also sells tiaras with gems, belts with gems, watches and other ladies' accessories.

The members of this group are from a small town called San Francisco Sayultepec where the majority of the people make a living through the cultivation of corn since most of the people are involved in planting.  One of the town's traditions is a celebration of the 24th of April during which they make a pilgrimage.  \r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Se\u00f1ora Ignacia, 53-years-old, who is known for being a somewhat quiet, but friendly woman.  She has two sons, Ramiro and Carlos, who love her very much and wish to help her.  She makes a living with the sale and manufacture of traditional clothing like huipiles (traditional woven skirts), napkins, and tablecloths, and has done so for 30 years.  She also makes a living by making tostadas, selling chicken, and raising pigs, which she has done for 18 years because she really likes to work.  She tells us that she goes to the neighboring towns like Ometepec, Zacatepec, Pinotepa and colonies of their community to sell her handicrafts.  \r\n\r\nOne of the things that she likes most is making the tablecloths and combining the colors of her huipiles and tablecloths.

Toda la familia vive en \"Los Bancos\" que es un cant\u00f3n rural de la Provincia de Pichincha, donde se encuentra la capital del Ecuador. Uno de los principales recursos \"Los Bancos\" es el h\u00eddrico ya que  en su territorio se originan un sin n\u00famero de riachuelos y peque\u00f1as vertientes que dan paso a r\u00edos de considerable tama\u00f1o. Este cant\u00f3n tiene un gran movimiento comercial que se desenvuelve en la calle principal, donde se encuentran hoteles, restaurantes y almacenes, sobre todo de productos agropecuarios, as\u00ed como servicios veterinarios y tiendas para el consumo diario de la poblaci\u00f3n.\n\nEste gran hombre trabajador, se dedica a la venta de madera desde hace 6 a\u00f1os; actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 de su familia que tambi\u00e9n se dedican a esto. Uno de los m\u00e1s grandes obst\u00e1culos que tiene es no tener un medio suficiente para sacar la madera a la venta y por esta raz\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 desea invertir en la compra de mulares para su negocio es decir comprar animales de carga. Esto le permitir\u00e1 a Jos\u00e9 ahorrar en lo que paga por fletes y alquiler de transporte, con ello tendr\u00e1 mayores ingresos y ser\u00e1 due\u00f1o de su propio transporte.\n\nEn su tiempo libre se dedica a estar con su familia, su sue\u00f1o es poder arreglar su finca para dedicarse a la agricultura y crianza de animales. Para ello necesita dinero y esperamos que con esta inversi\u00f3n est\u00e9 a un paso m\u00e1s cerca de tener la finca de sus sue\u00f1os y mejorar su calidad de vida\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 26 years old, and is married with two sons, one of whom is three years old, and the other is just a few months old. Their family lives in \u201cLos Bancos,\u201d which is a rural community in the Province of Pichincha, which is also home to the capital city of Ecuador. One of the main natural resources present in Los Bancos is water. In fact, countless streams are born there, and then run down the slopes of the land as they form sizeable rivers. The community is bustling with trade, especially along the main street, where there are hotels, restaurants, stores, and many agricultural products for sale. There are also veterinary services and many small general stores.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked hard selling wood for over six years. He learned this trade from his family members, who also work in the industry. One of the greatest challenges he has faced is how to transport wood down to the market for sale. Jos\u00e9 wants to invest in purchasing load-bearing animals for his business, which would allow him to reduce his costs for freight and renting transportation. This would simultaneously increase his income, as he would be the owner of his own transportation.\r\n\r\nIn his free time, he likes to be with his family. Jos\u00e9\u2019s dream is to settle his estate so he can focus his efforts on raising animals and on farming. In order to do that, he needs to save up more money. He hopes that, with the support from this loan, he will be one step closer to having the farm of his dreams and to improving his quality of life.

She is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000, which will be used to buy vegetables, raw pork meat, fish, frozen foods and other basic needs for her food production business. She knows that through this small business she manages, she will succeed. So,Teresa is hoping that her requested loan amount will be granted."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1085281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Humble and simple, she lives with her mother, whom she helps a lot thanks to the income derived from her small shop, since her mother works as a cleaning lady and her income is meagre. She lives in Imperial, a city blessed with warm weather, beautiful beaches, agricultural and commercial activities. Judith went through a lot of efforts and had to save money to set up her own business of selling clothes from a small stand at the market. It was difficult at first because she did not know much about business, but thanks to her cleverness and desire to get ahead she has been learning more and more. Her business is now one year old and she attributes its success to her being nice to her customers and selling quality clothing at affordable prices. Judith is very grateful for Kiva's help, which has enabled her to buy more supplies for her shop, particularly winter clothing, as this season draws nearer. This improvement will enable her to offer a greater variety of products and she will be able to increase her income, which will in turn help her in her daily struggle to make her greatest dream come

Jennifer's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a typical family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food to feed one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw ingredients. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams of giving her all of her children a good, high-quality education through her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches, its cuisine and for being one of the more important Pacific ports of the country as well as the American continent. This is where we met Karina; she is 40 years old, has been married for a long time but does not have children. Her husband is a physician. She is a member of the communal bank since its inception, and she likes it because loans are quick and very low-interest. She is an odontologist and her surgery is set up at her house, where she attends to many patients, who come for check-ups or alterations to their dental work. She works every day from 8 am to 6 pm and has been in this profession for 15 years, and thankfully she has always done very well.

is 30 years old. He comes from a small village of Vani District, West Georgia. Irakli is married and lives with his family, wife Larisa, two children (3 and 1 years old) and mother Natela. Larisa and Natela are housewives. Irakli is the only income provider in the family. He grows maize on a family owned plot of the land. Most of the harvest is used by the family and the small surplus is sold on the local market. The family also grows 100 nut trees selling the harvested nuts to local nut exporters. According to the local government\u2019s estimations (designation), the family belongs to the 'vulnerable poor' category. They receive relevant social assistance. Total average monthly income of the family is 275 Laris, including social assistance. \r\n\r\nIrakli requested credit for the start-up of a trade business. He will purchase fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices and resell them on the local retail market.  His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Irakli will be able to purchase fruits and vegetables. For the first time, Irakli will reinvest the whole profit in the business in order to expand it. In the long run, the income of the family will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions. Along with the above, the family, if needed, will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1085489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He lives in a small village of the Kakheti, Akhmeta District. Ivane is married and lives with his wife Lia and mother (who is retired). Lia works as a teacher in a local kindergarten. The family has a small vineyard and he sells grapes in the fall. The total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIvane requested credit for start up of a small village business. In particular, he will purchase a small truck. With the purchased truck Ivane will work on transportation. Mainly he will serve local companies for a certain fee. There are many small sawmills and stone-mills, which often need transportation of their products or raw materials. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

She started her career as a waxer and later took a course in hair dressing.  She continued her education in hair dressing for three years, eventually earning her certificate.  When she was sure that she had learned the job completely, she purchased the necessary equipment and opened up her hair salon.  \r\n\r\nShe has been Maya client for 4 years and has been purchasing equipment with the loans she has received from Maya.  With this first loan through Kiva, she intends to change the seats in her salon that seem to have worn out.  With what is left from her loan she is going to buy some hair coloring and other hair products to prepare for the summer season.  After renewing her shop and making it more appealing to her customers she will be set.  \r\n\r\nShe has hopes and plans for the future and remarks that she will feel safer once she has retired with a retirement fund, yet she will continue to work.  She wants her children to be able to finish their studies and get jobs for themselves.

Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nNugzar and Eliso will sow maize on the plot. They will work hard during spring and summer seasons to get a good harvest in late summer. They will sell harvested maize on the local open market. Along with the abovementioned, Eliso plans to purchase a piglet. She will raise the piglet for 5-6 months and sell the grown pig for a higher price. Eliso will reinvest the profit in the same business to expand it. In the long term, the income of the family will increase and they will get the possibility of combating poverty.

He is married and is the father of 7 children, all of whom are adults. They all went to school through primary school. He began his work by helping other farmers because he had to work to help his mother. At the age of 15 he began planting one-half manzana of beans and 1 manzana of corn for consumption (one manzana is about 1.75 acres). By the age of 20 he began to produce more beans and he sold his products, planting 2 or 3 manzanas of beans, since this was his only work. Later he also began to raise pigs to sell. With loans and through his own efforts he has bought land and livestock. His children help him. He sells his products in Managua. He would like to sell in his products in another location where they offer better prices. It has gone well enough for him, even though he sometimes has losses due to weather problems.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for the loan to buy a cow and to pay for labor for planting. This loan will help him buy supplies to better prepare his planting areas and thus obtain better results. His future plans are to buy more land and livestock to have another income.

It consists of nine members who are hard-working indigenous women with the desire to overcome and improve their quality of life. The members of the group are from a town called San Francisco Sayultepec, a little town where there are many large green trees. On the edge is a river that divides their town from a little town called Ipalapa.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Florentina, who is 57 years old. She has five children who are already married. She tells us that her work is making and selling handicrafts, such as blouses, tablecloths, and napkins. She tells us that she goes out to sell her merchandise in the neighborhoods of her community, and she goes to sell in Acapulco for a week and stays with her relatives. What she likes most about her business is sewing and embroidering, since she has liked to do this since she was very young, because her mother did the same work. One of the challenges that impedes her from continuing with her business is that sometimes she sells very little, but she also sells a lot, but when she doesn't have sales she becomes discouraged and sad. She is applying for the loan to buy more materials to make more blouses, napkins, and tablecloths, such as tablecloths, needles, ribbons, sewing thread, and strings of beads. She tells us that she is going to save her earnings for an operation on her foot, since she fractured it three months ago, but thanks to God she has had good earnings for the operation on her foot since it is hard for her to walk rapidly. She is thankful to the foundation for helping her so that she can continue with her business and above all for helping her companions so that they can enlarge their businesses and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rosalia, who sells clothing; Edith, who sells groceries; Eugenia, who sells Mexican snacks; Juana, who sells cheese; Maria de la Luz, who sells embroidery; Floriberta, who sells embroidery; Lucia, who sells embroidery; and Araceli, who sells embroidery. They give thanks to the foundation for helping them so that their lives get better every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1079477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy material to make tablecloths, blouses, and napkins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san francisco sayultepec,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floriberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7311.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7599.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8001.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8344.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8743.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":557.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":636.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":557.51,"local_amount":7311.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7324.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317569},{"amount":579.45,"local_amount":7599.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418955},{"amount":610.08,"local_amount":8001.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8015.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568531},{"amount":636.28,"local_amount":8344.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8359.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399832},{"amount":666.68,"local_amount":8743.32,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8758.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407550}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T08:49:36Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":421557,"name":"Asiat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiat is 45 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala East region of Uganda.

He tells us that for more than 12 years he has grown avocados and says that he started his business because there was a lack of stable work, and working as a day labourer does not pay well. Thanks to a gift of land from his father, he was able to begin planting avocados, and although this is a long-term investment, he is already seeing profits. He says that during the harvest season in May, he will go to sell his fruit by the bucket at the wholesale food market and earn a little more. He is asking for a loan to buy organic fertilisers which won't harm the land.\r\n\r\nAuscencio is married to Petra, who works making embroidered napkins, and they have three children - Sandra, 17, who us studying at secondary school; Guadalupe, 6, who unfortunately suffered a hip injury at birth and needs therapy to be able to walk; and Alejandra, who is 3. Auscencio's goal is to buy another plot of land where he can plant more avocados and begin cultivating poinsettias, and also to buy a frame to build a nursery. The other three members of his group are called Iv\u00e1n, Imelda and Julia, who also wish to invest in cultivating avocados and buying supplies to keep their avocado farms in top condition."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1080581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies for cultivating avocado, like organic fertilisers and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T12:10:03Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ausencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2689.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2838.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2891.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3056.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3113.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3171.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3231.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3291.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3352.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3415.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":422.12,"local_amount":5528.61,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5545.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317577},{"amount":445.69,"local_amount":5837.44,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5855.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418962},{"amount":700.23,"local_amount":9171.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9199.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568538},{"amount":488.88,"local_amount":6402.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6422.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399836},{"amount":507.3,"local_amount":6644.28,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6664.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407552},{"amount":260.78,"local_amount":3415.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3426.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392091}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T07:05:22Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":421707,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is 57 years old and married to Rogelio.

","en":"The \u201cLa Granada\u201d group has five female and one male members. This group is in the community of Dolores Hidalgo. It is a very small and quiet community. The group has always been very united and responsible with the institution. \r\nElda is the group\u2019s representative. She is 34 years old and has lived with Victor, her common-law husband, for four years. Together, they have started a family and they have two children. One child is in primary school and one is in secondary school.\r\nElda has raised and sold chickens for 14 years. She learned these skills from her mother. When she was waiting for her baby and couldn\u2019t work, she had to help her husband with the household expenses. She says that she loves to see the chickens with their little chicks. She has 30 chickens at her house with all of the chickens and chicks. This time, she has requested a loan to purchase more chickens and feed. \r\nThe biggest challenge Elda faces is when her chickens become sick and die. It is also very difficult to purchase vitamins every month because they are expensive. Many times, she does not have the resources to spend money on vitamins for the chickens. \r\nIn general, the whole group has goals and believe that with the loan, they can achieve their goals. One of Elda\u2019s goals is to be able to have sheep. Everyone is very grateful for the loan because it has helped them a lot. With the profits, they have been able to improve their quality of life. For example, they can purchase shoes, clothing, food and other things for their children. \r\nThis time, Severiana will purchase feed and medication for pigs and sheep. Isidro will invest in feed and ground corn for chickens. Ofelia will purchase feed for sheep. Eulalia will purchase food for pigs. Altagracia will purchase food and medication for pigs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1081365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase chickens and feed.
