The group is located in the community of Tres Estrellas (three stars). It is a community very far from town. It is a place where transportation is very scarce and, in general, people are dedicated to farming. The name of the group was chosen since one member of the group had planted some small trees where they meet and so this is how they named the group. This time the members have requested the loan to invest in their activities like, for example, Angela will invest in embroidery, Maria Leonely, Placida and Ignacia will buy sheep, Maximino will invest in a grocery store and Magdalena will invest in perfumes. All are very thankful for the loan granted since it will all them to buy all that they lack.\r\n\r\nMaura, who is the representative of the group, tells us that she is 47 years old. She has been married for 29 years to Federico who works with her although they have two children who depend on them and who are students, one in elementary school and the other in secondary school. Maura is dedicated to embroidery such as napkins, tablecloths, relgious embroidery, decorations for tables and other furniture. \"Since I was a girl, I learned since my mother taught me to embroider but also I liked it a lot since the finished product was very beautiful\". This time she has requested the loan to buy thread in different colors, plaid fabric, and needles. The greatest difficulty that Maura faces is selling her embroidery since almost all the women in her community embroider and they do not buy like they did before. But this does not deter her from continuing to make her product since she also shows them on tables for parties like this time when we visit her she was very happy since the son was getting married. One of Maura's goals is to buy sheep and improve her house. When she sells, her earnings are beneficial to buy what she lacks at home and to pay the bills.

","en":"The \"El cerrito\" group is located in a very small community where transportation is very limited. The group is located at the top of a hill (cerrito). The members of the group mention that in the past, it was a plain but it has converted into a little hill. Francisca is 64 years old. She is married to Francisco. They do not have any dependents. Francisca raises and sells animals. This time, she has requested a loan in order to purchase three sheep and feed since she has to purchase it every month. \r\nShe says that she always liked to take care of animals.  Taking care of them in this way lets the animals grow big and strong. She learned these skills from her mother. The biggest challenge that Francisca faces is during the drought since she cannot feed her animals.  For this reason, Francisca only has three sheep at her house. There are five at her daughter\u2019s house.  There are no fresh pastures where Francisca lives. There are a few where her daughter lives. Her grandson also takes them out to the pastures in the afternoon. Francisca is very grateful because thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase pasture land. In addition to the land, she can start her small candy shop. Since the start of the loan, she has been saving all of her earnings. With these, she can put money into the shop.

She would like to sell more clothes so she is asking for a loan to have additional capital for buying  used clothes, shoes and bags to sell. She needs P15,000. Part of the loan will also be used for buying hog feed for sustenance.\r\n \r\nVilma's goal in life is to keep growing as an entreprenuer in order to give the best education to her two children. She will be happy and proud to see them professionals in their chosen carreer someday.

is a 50-year-old married man and the father of three children. He has been working as a taxi driver for 13 years. His family expenses are increasing, which is why he was searching for another source of income. Jamil opened a cafe where he sells Manakish (a special Lebanese dough topped with thyme, cheese or other tasty ingredients, like a folded pizza usually eaten for breakfast). His Manakish are special since the dough is like pita bread which gives it a unique taste. He also sells soft drinks and sweets. \r\n\r\nJamil works as a taxi driver day and night, managing between the two businesses, and he hopes to expand both businesses. Jamil applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Al Majmoua, in order to support his newly established cafe business, because he believes that the more you invest in a certain business, the more it sprouts in the future. Most of his customers are relatives, neighbors and friends. He hopes one day most of the tourists he works with through his taxi business will come and taste his delicious Manakish.

Now Hizon is happy that all of his effort have produced good fruit. His children are now holding degrees and are able to help him financially, even in small amounts. Hizon wants to maintain his farming business. He doesn\u2019t want to rely only on his children to provide for the needs of his farm. Hence Hizon is asking for a loan of 50,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) to buy seeds, fertilizers and herbicides. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1086135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizers and herbicides.

He lives in the small village of Tskaltubo District with his family: his wife Maya, his 3-year-old daughter, and his mother. Maya works in a local company in nearby town and gets a monthly salary. Manuchar grows maize on a family-owned plot of the land. He works hard in the cornfield, especially in spring and summer periods. Manuchar sells the harvested maize on local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 450 Laris per month. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nManuchar requested credit for the start up of an agricultural business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. With the received credit, Manuchar will start a new type of family business. The family owns greenhouse constructions in the village. Manuchar will purchase polyethylene covers and make the greenhouses functional. He will grow greens and vegetables in the greenhouses during the whole year and sell them on the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase. Manuchar will be able to improve the living conditions for his family members. Along with the above mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1084711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He lives in Khoni District, West Georgia with his mother and 18-year-old niece. Mirza is busy with his small-scale family agricultural business. In particular, he runs a family-owned dairy farm. He has two milk cows and produces cheese, which he sells locally to dairy product retailers. According to the local government estimations, the family lives under the poverty line and they receive relevant social assistance on a monthly basis. The total average monthly income of the family is 270 Laris, including the social assistance. \r\n\r\nMirza requested credit to start up a trade business. He will purchase fruits and vegetables in East Georgia for wholesale prices and then sell them on Khoni and Martvili open markets. According to Mirza\u2019s estimations, the business will be profitable, as he has good contacts with East Georgian farmers and can get quality products for convenient prices. Little by little Mirza will expand the trade business through increasing turnover.\r\n\r\nMirza's loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income.

Nowadays she keeps her business going on her own. She depends on additional sources of income, since she helps support herself renting a room. Her expectations are to grow and to sell new products such as cheese and eggs. She requests the loan in order to invest in purchasing firewood so that she is ready for the winter, which she estimates will be helpful for her since during the rainy weather time of the year, the wood is scarce and gets more expensive. As a plan for her future she hopes her business can offer a variety of products such as wood, beans and perishable goods, with the aim of getting higher revenues in order to be able to make

She is married to Aureo, a driver, and is the mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZenaida runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Zenaida\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a cart. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared to brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her cart is located in an urban poor area, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, and also used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nZenaida hopes to to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Federico, a vendor. She if the mother of four children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continue to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMelina operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from the round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts, and bed sheets, as well as other crafts that most rug-makers make every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. \r\n\r\nMelina earns additional income from their tricycle which her husband drives regularly. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. She will be using the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, and thread for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMelina dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high-quality education through her hard work on her business.

She lives with her partner. She also has 2 young children who are in her charge. She lives with her husband and children in their own house. She explains that the quality of life in her community is that of subsistence. The majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who work in commerce and raise small and large animals, and some also work in agriculture. Juana lives in her own house in the small town of Wiracocha, in the district of Tambogrande, in the department of Piura. She only has the basic service of electricity. She gets water from a well. She also mentions that in this small town there are approximately 90 families that live in these conditions.\r\n\r\nJuana\u2019s business is raising, fattening, and selling small animals such as: domestic fowl, pigs, and guinea pigs. She raises these animals in corrals outside her house. She explains that she sells her animals either in the local market or to wholesale buyers. Rosa has 5 years of experience in this business, which has allowed her to maintain her established clientele. Her husband supports her whole-heartedly in her work because they have a very good relationship.\r\n\r\nJuana has proposed increasing the number of animals that she raises, fattens, and sells. This is because it is a very profitable business in the area. Because of these circumstances, she is requesting a new loan for 1,000.00 nuevos soles (PEN), which she will use to buy feed, vitamins, vaccines, and to make improvements to her animals\u2019 corrals. Over time, this will allow her to improve her family\u2019s quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1082481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed for fattening her animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-07T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-06T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.4,"local_amount":141,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":149.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423736},{"amount":29.82,"local_amount":74.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":78.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317154},{"amount":30.08,"local_amount":75.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":79.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373974},{"amount":31.76,"local_amount":79.4,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385219},{"amount":32.76,"local_amount":81.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":86.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368811},{"amount":33.6,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977858},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":87.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115051},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":88.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506730},{"amount":37.3,"local_amount":93.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":98.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058682},{"amount":38.56,"local_amount":96.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":101.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804252},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":98.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381695932}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T02:47:18Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T08:48:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":422364,"name":"Am\u00e9l\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Am\u00e9l\u00e9 est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 23 ans.

One of the main resources in Los Bancos is water. Many streams and small springs which lead to much larger rivers have their origin in the region. The canton is home to lots of commercial activity, which takes place on the main street where hotels, restaurants, and warehouses, mostly for agricultural products, as well as veterinary services and stores which provide items used daily by the general population are located.\r\n\r\nTo cover her living costs, Maria raises chickens. She learned this business from relatives. She has a hatchery where she works for eight hours a day. When the chickens are big, it is difficult to feed them. Another activity this enterprising woman considers complicated is cleaning the ground, which is necessary to keep the hatchery clean and productive. Maria would like to invest by purchasing baby chicks and feed since she has room for more chickens than she currently has. With this investment, she hopes to increase her earnings and be able to provide her children with a better quality of life. We hope that with this loan opportunity Maria will be able to achieve the goals she has set for herself, and one day become an important business

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She lives with her partner and her daughter in their own house.  The quality of life in the community is that of basic subsistence.  The majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who work in the selling and care of small animals and some also work in agriculture.  Rosa lives in her own house in the farm area Chica Alta of the Tambogrande district in the department of Piura.  She only has basic electricity.  It is also worth mentioning that in this farm area approximately 120 families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nRosa devotes herself to the commercial activity of selling primary necessity products such as: rice, sugar, vegetable stew, eggs, milk, oil, noodles, detergent, sweets, etc.  She has a small store installed in her own house, where she attends to her loyal customers.  She is also devoted to the raising, fattening, and selling of small animals such as: fowl, pig livestock, goats.  These animals are raised in external corrals outside her house.  However, she sells them in the local market and\/or to wholesale animal buyers.  It is worth mentioning that Rosa has 4 years of experience with this activity, which has allowed her to maintain an established clientele in both businesses.  Her domestic partner arduously supports her in the activities he does, and there is a good family relationship between the two of them.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Rosa has proposed the expansion of her inventory in her commercial establishment (store) and the raising, fattening, and selling of small animals.  The reason for this is that it is a very profitable activity in this area.  Thus, she is asking for a new loan for a total of S\/.1,500 nuevos soles, which will be used to invest in the purchase of merchandise (groceries) and 2 shelves for this business.  Also she will buy nutritionally balanced food, vitamins, and vaccinations and better the corrals where her animals live.  In time this will allow her to better her quality of life and that of her family.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1082454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise (groceries), shelves for her business, and nutritionally balanced food for her animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-07T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-06T07:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Indiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":109.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":112.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":122.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":139.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":144.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":147.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":211.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":214.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423735},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":111.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":113.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317153},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":112.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":114.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373973},{"amount":407.87,"local_amount":1064,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385218}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T05:42:40Z","paid_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hannah Katz","image":1962381}},{"id":422492,"name":"F\u00e9rouce","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un agent d\u2019une ONG, Ferouce est une jeune dame de 33ans.

She is married to Willie, a driver, and is the mother of two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \n\nFhevie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 18,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan in her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nFhevie hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1083765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Totonicap\u00e1n is one of the leading producers of crafts in Guatemala. Crafts are in high demand because of the quality and uniqueness of the products. \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas Trust Bank is in its sixth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and is composed of some original members and a few new recruits. The women welcome all visitors to their community with the following words: \"Totonicap\u00e1n \u2013 land of apples, and pines, and beautiful women.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, who is as enthusiastic as all of her Trust Bank members combined, is Santos. Named after holy week in Guatemala -- because that was when she was born -- Santos is 62 years old and has nine children. \r\n\r\nSantos purchases plain, raw yarn and then makes her own dyes to create a variety of colored yarn, which she then sells. She started her business 24 years ago after learning the trade from her husband\u2019s family. Santos then taught her children the technique, so now they also participate in the business. \r\n\r\nSantos is planning to use her new micro-loan to buy raw materials in bulk because the price is much better in bulk, and demand for her products is growing. In fact, one customer, who lives three and a half hours away, is requesting to have orders delivered every 15 days. Santos is thrilled with how well her business is going and now regularly employs three people. She hopes that if she continues to grow her business, she will be able to hire more employees.  \r\n\r\nSantos is very thankful to all the KIVA lenders for giving her the opportunity to improve her business, which not only helps her but also benefits her children. Las Manzanas Trust Bank is grateful to the KIVA investors for the loans. Thanks to the financial \"hand up,\" the Trust Bank members can move forward with their businesses even in tough economic times.

family\u2019s quality of life. Josefina is 38 years old and has been married for 22 years. She has eight children (six girls and two boys), four of whom are currently in school. \r\n\r\nWith only two years of formal education, Josefina created a textile business that produces typical skirts made with a foot loom.  The business has been around for nearly a decade. She and her family spend at least six days a week working to complete their orders, and Josefina travels one and a half hours via bus once a week to deliver the orders to clients. \r\n\r\nJosefina is starting her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Her daughter, Maria, has also joined Josefina\u2019s Trust Bank for her first loan cycle. Maria is completing her teaching degree while building up her small business. \r\n\r\nJosefina is very excited about her new loan with Friendship Bridge because she will be able to purchase a variety of yarn and thread for her textile business. Josefina's vision is to grow her business enough so that she does not need to take out loans in the future. Josefina also wants her children to stay in school and continue their studies in college. She was not able to continue with her schooling because her family needed her to work. \u201cBefore I joined Friendship Bridge, I did think that my girls' education was important, but now I know that they need to stay in school,\u201d she says.  \u201cBy staying in school, they will be able to increase their knowledge and be more successful.\u201d \r\n\r\nJosefina, Maria and 12 other women are part of the Choqui Trust Bank. The Trust Bank members are all from the village of Chipuac, a fairly rural area outside of Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala. Many of the women in the Choqui Trust Bank have animal husbandry businesses, such as raising chickens, while several other members are involved in the textile industry. Each member of the Trust Bank has a different story but they all share a common vision: to be successful and to improve their lives and the lives of their families and community members. The 14 women appreciate the moral and financial support KIVA lenders provide, and they are impressed that technology can unite people from around the world with Totonicap\u00e1n\u2019s communities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6450,"image":{"id":1084870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a dynamic young entrepreneur who is 22 years old, newly married, and doesn't have any children.  She works in her own hardware business, helping her husband who is a hardware dealer.  Before she got married, she learned the trade from her father who is in the same business, therefore this client is an expert in the field of selling building supplies and hardware.  She grew up in her biological family depending on this business.  The profits she makes from her business help her to save and buy food.  She is taking out her fourth loan.  Over the course of her previous loans, the client has seen her business thrive.  For this reason, she decided to increase her loan amount this time round.  She will use this new loan to stock up with electrical supplies.  In addition, she hopes to buy a plot of land in the future as she and her husband are still newly weds.  The client thanks Hekima for empowering poor women with low incomes.
