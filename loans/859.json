His home lacks basic services.  He tells us that approximately 80 families live in these conditions in his village.\r\n\r\nPedro's business activity is making and selling bricks.  He carries out this business on a plot of land near his home.  He also raises, fattens and sells livestock such as farmyard birds, pigs and goats.  He raises these animals in pens outside his parents' home.  He has his parents' support.  He tells us that he sells his animals either in the local market or to people who buy animals wholesale.  We should mention that Pedro has 10 years experience which has allowed him to build up a customer base for his businesses.  In addition, during the mango harvest season (the months of December, January, February and March each year) Pedro works as a security guard in a factory.\r\n\r\nPedro is currently requesting a new loan for 3,000 soles to buy fields from which he will get firewood that he needs for making his bricks.

Debido a que su trabajo tiene la reputaci\u00f3n de ser de muy buena calidad, sus ventas en estos dos a\u00f1os han venido aumentando considerablemente, y es por esto que ahora busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar materias primas para su taller de reparaci\u00f3n de calzado como son pegantes, cauchos, suelas, entre otros m\u00e1s.\nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 seguir ofreciendo a sus clientes un buen trabajo y as\u00ed cada vez podr\u00e1 captar un mayor n\u00famero de clientes para su negocio, de modo que sus ventas aumenten y sus ingresos cada vez aumenten de igual forma; as\u00ed sus hijos podr\u00e1n seguir teniendo una buena calidad de vida y seguir estudiando sus carreras universitarias. \n","en":"Luz Fanny is someone who has had to overcome many challenges in her life, yet she has always had the strength to get ahead.  Separated from her husband and single mother to her two children, Luz Fanny's only source of income is her shoe repair shop, which she has had for about two years.  However, she has around 10 years of experience in this work, as she worked for a business for a long time, but she felt that she wasn't being paid well enough and decided to set out on her own and start her own shop.  Thanks to this business, she has the opportunity to generate income for her household and offer her children the basic necessities, as well as pay for their university education.  Because she has a reputation for doing very good work, her sales have increase considerably over the past two years.  This is why she is looking for a loan; to buy raw materials for her shoe repair shop, such as adhesive, rubber, and soles, among other things.\r\n\r\nThis will allow her to keep offering her customers good work and, in this way, she will be able to keep getting more customers for her business.  This will make her sales increase and her income will increase along with it, allowing her children to keep their good quality of life and finish their university studies.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1080013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Ella desde muy joven ha sido muy activa y trabajadora. En su dinamismo aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de panader\u00eda cuando se educ\u00f3 en \u00e9l y hasta hace dos a\u00f1os fabricaba pudines y los vend\u00eda en diversas tiendas y a una clientela dom\u00e9stica entre conocidos, familiares y amigos; as\u00ed mismo aprendi\u00f3  a confeccionar ropa y confeccionaba, pero su esposo le recomend\u00f3 dejar de trabajar en estas actividades  y dedicarse a su hogar por cuestiones de salud, por eso decidi\u00f3   dejarlos, buscando una actividad en la cual no dejara de producir y pudiera ejercerla mas c\u00f3modamente y con mayor flexibilidad.

En general no maneja inventarios porque vende todos los productos que solicita, en tanto trabaja sobre pedidos de sus clientes, pero muchas veces le preguntan precisamente por productos que no tiene en el momento  y esto es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual est\u00e1 acudiendo a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanc\u00eda variada de la que mas rota en su negocio, como cosm\u00e9ticos, joyas, bisuter\u00eda y maquillaje, lo cual har\u00e1 sobre pedidos y tambien para tener un stock que le permita captar un mayor n\u00famero de clientes y ganar un poco mas de dinero, pues en ello radica justamente el \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n.    ","en":"Nimia, 63, lives in the city of Barranquilla with her husband, who is retired.  They have three children, ages 32 to 39.  She has been very active and hardworking since she was very young.\r\n\r\nWith her energy she learned the trade of baking when she trained in the field.  Up until two years ago she made pudding and sold it in various stores and to home customers, among acquaintances, family members, and friends.  She also learned to make clothing, and she was making clothing, but her husband recommended that, for health reasons, she stop doing this work and dedicate herself to the home.  This is why she decided to leave those jobs, looking for a job in which she could produce and be able to to it more comfortably and with greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis was how she came to sell products through specialized guides or catalogues.  She tried three businesses until she chose one of them because she liked its work method and adapted it to her clientele, which she has built from among her friends and family members, who have referred her to other buyers.  This has turned into her sales strategy with her best customers.  Nimia grants one-month deadlines to pay for her products.  She works alone in her business and permanently visits her actual and potential customers to achieve business competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIn general she maintains no inventory because she sells all the products she requests and works on customer orders.  But many times they ask her for products she does not have at the moment, and this is the reason she is coming for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy a variety of merchandise of what most turns over in her business, such as cosmetics, jewelry, costume jewelry, and make-up.  She will sell these on order and also keep some in stock, which will allow her to attract a greater number of customers and earn a little bit more money.  This is where the success of her investment lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1076037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, jewelry, costume jewelry, and make-up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-07T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-06T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimia Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38698},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52124},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53340},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54584},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55858},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":57161},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58495},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":59860},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61257},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62686},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64149},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81788}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":414204,"name":"Diana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Diana is 42 years old and a married woman.

She is married to Policarpio, her business partner, and a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGliceria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells RTW products for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGliceria hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1087119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional stock of 'Ready To Wear' merchandise and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gliceria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":13333,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13380.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095735},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10667.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10704.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359345},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10666.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10704.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303160},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5351.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355885}],"funded_date":"2012-05-16T02:22:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":422340,"name":"Hezbon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hezbon is 53 years old, married, and blessed with six children.

Her husband is a farmer. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of earning some extra money and helping her husband with their household expenses and their children's education, three years ago she and her mother-in-law started a business buying and selling sausages. She says that her mother-in-law has a car and three times a week they get products sent from Cuenca that they then deliver to small merchants or stores in the area. She tells us that it's going well because they are the only ones delivering these products in their community. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy sausages for resale. She's been through 5 cycles and is the president of the village bank. She likes it for the help and benefits that she receives from the bank. Her dream is to have a refrigerated car.

He lives in the small village of Tskaltubo District with his 15-year-old son, Irakli. Irakli goes to school. Zurab\u2019s wife lives out of the country. Zurab earns a living through agricultural business. He has 2 milk cows. Zurab produces cheese. Also he grows greens on a family-owned plot of land. Zurab sells greens and cheese on Kutaisi open market. Total average monthly income of the family is 150 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category.\r\n\r\nZurab requested credit for purchasing materials for greenhouse construction. His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and who are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Zurab will purchase wooden materials and a polyethylene cover.

The town is very near the sea, 20 minutes from the city of Barranquilla. There, he has a shoe cobbling business which generates revenue to support his family and household. He has a small travelling workshop that he rolls from his house to the main square where he works, and he is recognized by all the people of Puerto Colombia. \r\n\r\nJesucristo provides repair services for all kinds of footwear - he changes soles, fixes heels, dyes the uppers of the shoes and occasionally stitches them. He learned this trade at a young age, from a gentleman in St. Nicholas square in Barranquilla. His work provides him with enough income to live in dignity. \r\n\r\nJesucristo is currently applying for this loan, with which he will purchase materials and supplies for everyday use such as soles, insoles, rubber and shoe uppers. He will purchase wholesale to benefit from bulk discounts and build up a stock, which will allow him to serve his customers in a more timely manner. \r\n\r\nIn good humor, Jesucristo considers that with his name, he has no 'Tocayo'  (a word used to refer to another person that has the same name), and between laughter and jokes he says that people lend to him with confidence because \"Jesus Christ did not hurt anyone.\"\r\n\r\nThis loan is the first loan that he has taken with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, because he has many dreams as opening his own public premises. He wants to improve the organization of his business, and this loan will begin the path to his goals.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Puji has spent her business income and even business capital to help her husband to fix the car.\r\n\r\nPuji wants to continue her kiosk business by purchasing products such as sugar, instant noodles, coffee, milk, eggs, bath soap, detergent, etc., to sell. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,000,000.

There she has a little general store and sells a variety of merchandise retail, such as stationery supplies, articles of silver, clothing, footwear, etc.\r\n\r\nHer entrepreneurial experience dates to 25 years ago when she began selling fried pies, fried foods, and fast food in general.  It went very well for her in this and so she planned to travel to a border town where she bought various articles, such as sweaters and bedclothes, at good prices; she sold to customers who had asked her to buy for them.\r\n\r\nSome time later she got pregnant and was unable to continue to travel.  She sought the help of a partner but the business did not work out and it brought her losses.  This is why she decided to study cosmetology, and when she finished her studies, she got a job in a beauty salon where she acquired a lot of experience for 13 years.  It went very well for her, but her husband got sick and she had to abandon this work to care for him exclusively.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, she was alone and she decided to generate income by selling merchandise.  She began to travel to the city of Medell\u00edn to buy merchandise, and as it went well for her, later she acquired her display cases and she stocked them.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is very highly regarded in her neighborhood.  Her main customers are neighbors, family members, friends, and referrals, preferably school and university employees, who buy from her to pay in negotiable installments.\r\n\r\nIn her business she receives her daughter's help taking care of the daily sales in her shop, which require her to be on duty all the time because she does business in cash.  They are very close in her family and her children and grandchildren are part of it.  She shares all the household expenses with them.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia has additional income generated from two public-service taxis.  She also does hairdressing when she can for steady customers who do not change their beauty service and who have confidence in her knowledge and experience to improve their image.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy merchandise for the celebration of Mother's Day, a time in which her sales increase and she adapts her offerings to the needs of her women customers, who buy cosmetics, clothing, footwear, home products, and stationery.  And this is precisely the reason for the success of her investment, the product of her Kiva loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1076090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, clothing, footwear, home products, and stationery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T14:40:05Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":179397},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238338},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":243899},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":249590},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":255414},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":261374},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":267473},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":273714},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":280100},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":286636},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":293324},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":370741}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":422459,"name":"Proscovia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Proscovia is 37 years old and is widowed with six children, five of whom are currently in school.

She is the mother of three children who are 16, 24 and 30 years old.  Nidian has a general store where she sells a variety of merchandise.  She also spends part of her mornings preparing and selling lunches.  These businesses both make her income which has helped her to improve the well-being of her household.\r\n\r\nNidian's life as a saleswoman began six years ago when she started selling products through specialized catalogs.  Her business has slowly grown and she has bought display cabinets where she can display her products nicely.  In addition, she also sells sweet treats and cell phone minutes which makes her additional income.  She makes the most of the fact that she has 'captive' customers who visit her each day.  Nidian makes her sales for cash and on credit, after carefully weighing up her customers.  She acquires her confectionery products and the supplies she needs to prepare her lunches in Barranquilla city center for cash.  She buys the merchandise that she sells through her catalogs on credit.  \r\n\r\nNidian's goal for the future is to have larger premises which are dedicated to her business.  However, her biggest challenge is having enough cash funds to expand her business, respond to her customers and ensure she always has a well-stocked store.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy catalog cosmetics, confectionery and a larger volume of supplies so that she can produce even more food.

This is 49-year-old Rebecca from Calabatown, in the eastern area in Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of 11 and 32. Two of her children currently attend school and one is in university. For the past 16 years, Rebecca has run a bar and restaurant within a busy market where she sells soft drinks, Star Beer, Heineken, chicken snacks, fried fish, and fried rice. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband to support her family. Rebecca\u2019s other source of income comes from renting out an old house.
