Married to Brice JOMAKI, a retailer, Clarisse has four children in her care, three of which are her own. All the children are at school. The family lives together in Zogbo. Clarisse helps her husband with the upkeep and education of the children. Clarisse went to primary school only. For almost 20 years Clarisse has been selling food produce (corn, rice, etc.) and other miscellaneous items from her home. Clarisse stocks up at Glazou\u00e9 and also at Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market. Her business allows her to bring in an income which helps her to make a living. At present Clarisse does not have sufficient funds to allow her to satisfy the large number of clients she has and to have a higher income in order to cover her various expenses. In order to strengthen her business Clarisse is thus asking for a second loan from ALID\u00e9. Clarisse has already had one loan from ALID\u00e9 which was repaid without any problems.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":469581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of bags of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T08:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarisse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859056},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619199},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653083},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835222},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575613},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":17142.86,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954114},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":17142.84,"processed_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":17724.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055774}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T12:55:38Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:30:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":172552,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, es socia del Bancomunal Ni\u00f1o Nativo, ubicado en el distrito de Acoria, en el departamento de Huancavelica, es casada y tiene un hijo de 10 a\u00f1os.

She owns a business venture, driving a taxi.  Maimoaga has 4 years of experience in this business.  Maimoaga needs a loan of WST $1200 to maintain the vehicle.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maimoaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maimoaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maimoaga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Rosa works selling tortillas, which she makes and then sells throughout the neighborhood.  She counts on a good customer base, as she has been in this type of business for many years.  Her tortilla business is located in her home where, midday, she dedicates herself to washing the corn, then milling and making the tortillas.  These are in great demand in this country, as they are an integral part of the Salvadoran diet.  For this reason, the business is profitable, and she lives off of the income it generates.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy corn at lower wholesale prices.  She would also like to buy some tanks of propane gas in order to have an extra supply of these.

His wife and elder son help him with caring for their land. In the past, Alkham has had problems with harvesting, and also having to sell his crop in advance and therefore seeing reduced earnings.\r\n<br>Now, Alkham has gained a lot of experience in his business and today his crop is one of the most demanded at the market. He now faces a small problem because his field is infertile, which makes it difficult to grow his crop. To solve this problem, Alkham has decided to request a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field and make his crop more productive. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is a hard working and young career woman. She lives with her parents. She is a primary school teacher from Monday to Friday until 2pm. But she also rents out children's costumes that the school children use for various events. She decided to start up this business because she saw that the school kids were renting these costumes at very high prices. she acquired some costumes and started renting them at better prices, a venture that has been very successful, especially during the holiday seasons such as the Week of the child, Mother's Day, Father's day, and for national holiday parades. For the past 8 years she has worked as both a teacher and a business owner and she has seen great success, giving her a great deal of personal pleasure.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires.  Its gases can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":802536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743312},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594773},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T08:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265712},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-25T09:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691513},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647878},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865011},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274995},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416461},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131263},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-01T08:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5107.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947067},{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.87,"payment_id":283296461}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T02:06:03Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":316510,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Close to Abena, on the floor, are umbrellas and underwear.

Her friendliness and respectful attitude have given her a good reputation at the market. Irina has also proven to be a good manager of her finances. She has received and promptly repaid 12 loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Loans have enabled a gradual expansion of Irina\u2019s business. Originally she had only one portable table with office supplies. Lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped her purchase inventory in bulk and rent a storage room. Recently she bought two copier machines and now provides copying services.\r\n\r\nIrina is requesting a loan of $1,200 for several purposes. She is planning to purchase a range of office supplies, toner and copier paper. Financial assistance will help Irina secure good maintenance for her copy machines so that she can provide a high quality copying service. It will also help her cover some necessities at home to improve the quality of life for her family. Increased sales and services will generate more profits allowing Irina to save money and eventually buy a facility for her business which has always been her dream.

","en":"Sonia is 36 years old, and lives with her husband and son in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. She has been connected to agricultural activities since her childhood, but several years ago, low market prices did not meet the great physical effort and economic investment needed to plant. At other times, drastic climatic changes caused her crops to fail. Due to this situation, she chose to look for alternative crops that would improve her production and thus compensate her investment. Therefore, she began to plant grains such as wheat, corn, barley and quinoa, which she harvests and processes, adding value to her products - for example, making corn flour, which she keep in sacks and later sells in the market of the city closest to her community. Sonia feels very happy now about that decision, and she plans to acquire more lands in the future to increase her grain production. <p>This is the third loan opportunity she has had with MFP and is very eager to continue working for the common good with her communal bank.

Mema M. is 37 and married with 3 children.

Fati Mema needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Fati Mema joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fati Mema's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her husband has been a wooden house builder for more than 15 years.\r\n\r\nSokhom has been selling meals in front of a garment factory for more than 5 years. She also was hired by her villagers to finish ready-made clothes when she is free. She cuts sewing thread. \r\n\r\nSokhom asked for a Kiva loan one time already. But she does not have transportation and she very often spends a lot of money for traveling costs. It\u2019s difficult for her to manage their income to support their family. So she is requesting her second loan in the amount of US $700 to purchase a motorbike for commuting.

She is 63 years old. Florante is widowed. To make a living, Florante owns & operates transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating these services. Florante has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Florante joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florante is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to repair her existing vehicle for better service. This will be the first loan taken out by Florante from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Paralelamente  cultiva alfalfa para venderla al por mayor. Por tal raz\u00f3n, no tiene un horario fijo, de trabajo, pero es muy constante en la realizaci\u00f3n de sus bordados ya que  por la complejidad del trabajo y el grosor del bordado en la tela este trabajo dura hasta un mes de realizado. Como resultado termina en una bella prenda  t\u00edpica que causa admiraci\u00f3n en sus clientes y finalmente son comprados al contado. La \u00e9poca m\u00e1s rentable  en su negocio es cuando  est\u00e1n en plena \u00e9poca de festividades t\u00edpicas llamadas la fiesta del Santiago que se celebra mucho por su zona. Desea crecer en su producci\u00f3n de faldas bordadas y contratar personas para ayudarla  en esta confecci\u00f3n. Es su quinto cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, siempre se ha destacado en su grupo solidario por ser puntual en sus pagos y se ha ganado la confianza de los dem\u00e1s integrantes, en todas estas oportunidades de cr\u00e9dito que ha tenido. Con el dinero que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de hilos y telas, a la vez  comprar\u00e1 semillas y sacos de abono para sembrar alfalfa en algunos terrenos que adquiri\u00f3 recientemente. \n\n","en":"Victoria lives with her daughters in the house her parents left her. She has been doing embroidery by hand for three years. She began this at the invitation of one of her friends who taught her this trade, and now she works independently in the comfort of her home so she can take care of her house and her daughters. She also grows alfalfa to sell wholesale. For this reason, she does not have a fixed schedule, but she is very regular about doing her embroidery because the complexity of the work and the thickness of the embroidery on the cloth make one project take up to a month. She ends up with a beautiful traditional outfit that her customers admire, and that is finally paid for in cash.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable time for her business is during the traditional feast of Santiago (St. James), which is celebrated a lot in her area. Victoria wants to increase her production of embroidered skirts and to hire people to help her make them. This is her fifth loan with MFP. She has always stood out in her communal bank for being punctual with her payments, and she has earned the trust of the other members in all the opportunities she has had to receive loans. She will invest the money she is asking for in the purchase of thread and cloth. At the same time she will buy seeds and sacks of organic fertilizer to sow alfalfa on some land she acquired recently.

When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":151741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fruit, vegetables, rice, and oil in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-21T09:10:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marthar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-06T16:00:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52696.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230117},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52696.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259182},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52696.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287924},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52696.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318223},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52696.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350101},{"amount":40,"local_amount":47058.8,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":49019.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347597},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52083.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970217},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52083.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886467},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52083.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435752},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52083.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130057}],"funded_date":"2008-04-22T16:00:48Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49358,"name":"Elva","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Se\u00f1ora Elva lives in the Yarina District of the Ucayali department, and belongs to the Mujeres con Futuro Comunal Bank.

Her dream is that the help she receives from friendly organizations will also help those people who really need it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":324432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":450.85,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":478.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956949},{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":449.15,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":477.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055673},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599862},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035751},{"amount":150,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2867.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948149}],"funded_date":"2009-05-28T00:19:54Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":114913,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 45 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo Valent\u00edn (de la misma edad), quien es chofer, y con sus hijos Magali de 22, Mayra de 20 y Valentina de 3 a\u00f1itos en su casa propia.

Her children are Magali, 22; Mayra, 20; and Valentina, 3.\r\n\r\nFor two years she has been in the business of public Internet access, which is set up in her house.  She previously had to rent a place, but thanks to a loan with MFP, she was able to arrange to set up the cubicles in her house.  She now works more calmly. She really likes the business since it is easier to work on it full time, even though many times all she has to do is resolve problems with the computers.\r\n\r\nHappily, she has always known how to get ahead, and she knows that if she wants to keep progressing, she needs to work a lot.  She is also thinking of putting a center for making phone calls on the side of her place. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Prisma.

He has a shop in Wayerma I opposite the Malian Agency for Press and Publicity (AMAP) in Sikasso, not far from the central prison. Mr. K. is much in demand with his clientele for the quality of his products. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to better satisfy his ever growing clientele, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about two years ago. He is on his second individual loan after having reimbursed the first one without difficulty.<P>\r\n\r\nHe intends to buy 15 lengths of \u201cbazin\u201d (damask), 10 sacks of potash, 15 packets of caustic soda, and 10 boxes of dye of various colors. He will buy these goods in Bamako and then re-sell them to a clientele composed generally of women who do dyeing in Sikasso and surrounding areas, retail, for cash, and sometimes on credit. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 150,000 F CFA which will be used essentially to grow his working capital, help support the family, and pay the interest on the loan, investing any remainder back into his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Her husband is not working because he lost his sight as result of health problems.  \r\n<p>\r\nDelia is requesting a loan so that she can invest in her grocery store and diversify her products in time for the Christmas season.

A. is a man of 36 years of age who lives with his wife and son in a community called Cimarron Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the Cartago Province. It is a small rural community of about two thousand people. Its population is engaged in milk production and agriculture. It has an irregular mountainside, and much of the ground is maintained like a moist tropical forest. Cimarron is located approximately 1.5 hours by bus from Turrialba, the nearest trading center. However, several times a year, the road becomes impassable due to rain.\r\n\r\nFor several months, Mr. Adrian wanted to start a business raising chickens for fattening and laying hens for meat and eggs, but at this time he lacks the animals for which his business could grow. He expects to sell his products to neighbors in his community. He says that the project is very interesting.\r\n\r\nMr. Adrian is currently applying for a micro-credit of 500,000 colones for the purchase of chickens and hens, and products for the treatment of diseases, among others. With this loan, he hopes to grow his business and improve the quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\nMr. Adrian is a partner of the New Hope Community Bank for Cimarron, one of 100 community banks of EDESA in Costa Rica.

This business provides a way for her to improve her living conditions.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":433440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T14:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gonzalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753164},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142217},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979604},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010621},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734984},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768441},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085898},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":803.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799762},{"amount":85,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904933}],"funded_date":"2009-11-26T01:29:46Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":160208,"name":"Kibimbiri Group B, Kihihi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

She is 35 years old. Maria Luisa is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Maria Luisa runs a general store, selling both food and daily use products in her local community. Maria Luisa has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nMaria Luisa joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Luisa is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maria Luisa from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to their house. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Northern region of Costa Rica, minutes from the Nicaraguan border. Xinia is a dedicated producer and mother. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers. She works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land she works is her own. In addition to her agricultural activity, Xinia feels it is important to be an active member of her community. As a result, she dedicates a significant portion of her time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Xinia and her family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Xinia is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land as well as her labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Xinia and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Xinia, with the help of her family members in the region of Upala. The productive cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Xinia expects to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, she dedicates the hours from 7AM to 4PM everyday to her agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Xinia and other producers in the Upala community face, is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Xinia, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Xinia wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T19:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":6.65,"local_amount":3325.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3383.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970539},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":8678.3,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-03T08:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8829.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289984},{"amount":375.99,"local_amount":187995.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":191267.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614326}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T22:05:15Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242783,"name":"Jessica Len's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessica Len J. is from the village of San Pablo, Cauayan City, Isabela.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store.  Her husband Edgardo, who is 33 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 8 to 12 years old. Marigold joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marigold has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for their future, for their daily needs & for the education of their children.  Marigold is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is married to a businesswoman and has 4 children aged 18, 13, 11 and 3 years respectively. In 1996, Yusifu S established his jeans, polo shirts, Lacoste clothes, and bags business. He started business at the time his father died when he was in form two (education level) and there was no other financial support. He decided to leave school and went to a mining area. He engaged in mining and acquired some funds which he used to start his business.   Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,510,800 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Yusifu S has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase jeans 70 pieces @ Le35,000, shirts 36 pieces @ Le25,000, lacoste - 24 pieces @ Le22,000. The balance of the loan will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,160. In the future, Yusifu S plans to complete his construction building, educate his children, and he also wants to open another shop. His major challenge is the fluctuation in foreign currency.  Competition is high but he is different from his competitors because he always has what the customers want.  He serves 10 customers each day.  His business is popular because he provides good customer care and he has quality items. Yusifu does not have any employees. His suppliers are located in Conakry, Guinea and he transports his goods by public transport. He buys three times in a month.  He ploughs the profit back into the business.  He plans to expand and this will be accomplished by acquiring more loans.

is a hard-working mother of three. She sells some cloth, but mostly pots and other light-weight metal containers. The most amazing part is that she walks around the city in search of customers while balancing all of her stock on a piece of cloth placed on top of her head. This type of selling strategy is called \u201chawking.\u201d It is common in Ghana, but normally for lighter-weight items. A lot of hawkers complain of neck and head pains from hawking, but Elizabeth, at the age of 55, says the only challenge that she has encountered is not having enough profit to expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nMuch of Elizabeth\u2019s profits went to her children\u2019s education fees, but now 2 have completed school, so she is able to focus more on her business. Her goal is to eventually sell from an indoor store so she is able to carry more stock. With the profits that she will be making, she plans to pay for the education of her youngest child and to finish building a house for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth is a member of the Bisa Ewurade group. The group lending system allows several people to provide collateral or guarantee a loan through a group repayment pledge. Peer pressure and support provide the incentive to repay; if one person in the group defaults, the other group members make up the payment amount.\r\n<p>\r\n(*Photo Note: in the photo a friend helps Elizabeth lift the heavy load onto her head to start her day hawking)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":86340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her inventory by purchasing metal pots and containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2007-11-21T01:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-05T04:13:08Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":100.8,"processed_date":"2008-01-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":109775},{"amount":105,"local_amount":100.8,"processed_date":"2008-02-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129027},{"amount":105,"local_amount":100.8,"processed_date":"2008-03-05T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":150178},{"amount":105,"local_amount":100.8,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174610},{"amount":105,"local_amount":100.8,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201846},{"amount":100,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":97.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229051}],"funded_date":"2007-11-21T04:13:08Z","paid_date":"2008-06-05T09:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28890,"name":"Marciano","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Marciano Z. is 47 years old and has been married for 23 years to Ermelinda who is 45 years old.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

After a long apprenticeship, she decided to become specialized in the commerce of smoked fish.  Today, she is 48 years old and in a polygamous arrangement, living with her husband and four children (one girl and three boys) in her own house in the Hamdallaye district of Koutiala Prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  With eighteen years of experience, she is in great demand and highly valued at the weekly fairs of the surrounding villages.  \r\n\r\nShe has had an association with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso for three years.  After four solidarity loans (group loans) and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is on her second individual loan.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 10 large baskets of smoked fish in the Mopti region from fishermen (Bozos and Somonos) in order to stock up and to make retail sales, in bulk and for cash, at the fish market of the city of Koutiala and at the weekly fairs nearby to customers composed of retailers, homemakers, and restauranteurs.  \r\n\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA, which will be used to cover the loan interest, to provide for the family, and the rest to boost working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

As a part of her business expansion, Bertha has added cooked rice and stew to her product line, and when asked she said most of her customers request the rice, so she saw it as an opportunity. She hopes to raise more income to help her husband take care of the children's educational needs.

She mainly buys and sells tabloids, newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nNieva has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow twelve times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she has borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the continued success of her business, Nieva is applying for a PHP 40,000 loan. This money will be used to buy more magazines, newspapers and tabloids for selling. Nieva dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education, and have a long and comfortable life with her entire family.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community.

They live in Dasmarinas where they raise their only son, who is now in elementary.\r\n\r\nBeing in the direct-selling business, Jo-ane has developed the skill to choose the quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood to turn them into regular customers. She sells shirts, pants, bags, and shoes that suit the tastes of her friends and business connections. That is the reason her business works. Jo-ane also sells frozen foods to household people who take time to cook. Monthly, she earns an average net income of Php 10,800.  \r\n\r\nJo-ane wants to maximize her potential as a multitasking entrepreneur. To help her continue operation of her businesses, she would like to request for a  Php 31,000 loan. She plans to use this to increase the number of products she sells in order to better meet the specific needs of her regular customers. More importantly, she is planning to use a big part of the loan to start another business.\r\n\r\nSure enough, Jo-ane never misses her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays for the ability to collect their payments and use the money in her soon-to-open business. All this multitasking is a means of preparation for the multifaceted future which she wants her only son to have.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Se introduce el ganchillo por la lazada. Se recoge la lana de detr\u00e1s de la lazada con la punta del ganchillo. La pasamos a trav\u00e9s de la parte delantera de la lazada. Con cuidado, tiramos del extremo de la lana para que quede la lazada tirante alrededor del ganchillo.

He\u2019s a bricklayer\u2019s assistant, that is to say, he works building houses.  They had three children together who are 9, 8 and 6 years old.  All of them are attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth cycle Susana has taken a loan out in and she\u2019s satisfied with the results she\u2019s gotten.  On this occasion she\u2019s asking for the loan to invest half of it in the purchase of three sheep to raise and put out to pasture and the other half to buy yarn, needles, hooks, etc. to make tablecloths, vests, mats, sweaters and other knitted items.  This is the first time she\u2019s going to experiment with raising sheep at home.  She\u2019s attracted to this because she knows that if she takes care of them and causes them to fatten up she can sell them later on.  \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to invest your money in something so that when you need to sell your assets you recover your investment,\u201d says Susana.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the textiles, she has two years\u2019 experience.  This is her successful business because she says that she knows how to do it very well and what better thing to do than to put it into practice.  The way she makes these textiles is the following:  With a knitting needle.  \u201cLike any activity, knitting also requires much patience and dedication.  The \u201cganchillo\u201d is a method for knitting with yarn or thread using a hook and a ball of yarn.  One usually holds the hook in the right hand but even left handed people can learn to use the hook by just inverting the instructions.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo begin, make a slipknot.  \u201cPull on the thread of yarn in the center of the ball.  You pull a bow of about 12 to 15 centimeters from the end placing said end in front of the ball of yarn and then we let the rest of the end of the yarn to fall slightly behind the bow.  The hook is introduced through the bow.  The yarn is gathered behind the bow with the tip of the hook.  We pass it through the front of the bow.  Carefully we pull on the end of the yarn so that the bow is taught around the hook.  That\u2019s the first purl,\u201d says Susana.  She shared with us the way to knit because as she mentions to do so requires great patience.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she\u2019d like to continue to grow in her business because she knows how to do it and wants to continue putting it into practice.  \u201cI want to continue to help my children to go to school and to help my husband with expenses,\u201d says Susana.  With profits from her business she\u2019d like to do some home improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":985305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep to raise and to buy embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":993506,"name":"Thy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thy, 60, is married and has three dependent children, one of whom is studying in a university.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

He will use the loan to expand his workshop, which will allow him to receive more vehicles for repair. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":250034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand his auto-repair workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-04T07:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":103.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":109.99},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":115.72},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117.51},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.12,"local_amount":103.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":114.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228281},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":109.99,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423513},{"amount":41.33,"local_amount":115.72,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":127.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116775},{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":117.51,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011706},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":124.42,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":137.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595312},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":128.42,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989531}],"funded_date":"2009-01-04T10:01:03Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Bolton","image":517266}},{"id":86273,"name":"Koem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Koem L., 43, is a widow living in the Kampong Cham province with her two children.

Minavar is a 52-year-old widow. She has a son from her marriage. Minavar works cultivating a small farm, which she has done for more than 20 years. She grows different types of vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers. Every day she gets up very early. At 5 AM, Minavar drives to the produce market in the capital to sell her products, while her son takes care of the daily work on the farm. <P>\r\n\r\nMinavar is very proud of the work they've done together, she and her beloved son, and grateful that they've been able to acquire the comforts they have in their home. They have made good use of the loans since today it's very difficult without the extra help. Minavar is applying for a loan through IMON International for the fourth time. The loan will be used to buy fertilizer, seeds and insecticide that they need for their business.   \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is an enterprising woman who has a strong desire to work and get ahead.  For 7 years she has been raising barnyard animals such as chicken, quail, ducks and rabbits, which she sells to the market traders in her area.

She gets very good earnings, which allow her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nOrtencia likes this work very  much because it is going very well.  In addition, she has many plans in mind to develop, since she wants to provide her children with a good education and a better quality of life.

In addition, she wants to continue taking loans from this institution because she says that from the start they trusted her and helped her to advance.  The money that she requests now will be used to buy a large quantity of feed for her animals, so that she can continue to be successful with them.

Also, she wants to buy a better kitchen that would allow her to more quickly manage the lunch hour for the people who are used to coming to lunch at her small, improvised pension, a place that has been growing little by little though this institution's loans.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group's members work by selling bread, cosmetics, and groceries.

He is single and has no children. He only studied through 10th grade, and didn't continue due to financial difficulties. He lives in a rental house and pays 800 Meticais a month in rent. He helps to support his nephew who lives with him. \r\n\r\nDaniel left Zambezia for the district of Namaacha with his uncle, thinking that he would go to school there. After arriving in Namaacha he did continue with his studies, and finished 10th grade, but his schooling was interrupted when his uncle died. He then started his own business with the money he received after his uncle's death, intended to help him get by on his own. Today Daniel is the owner of two kiosks in the Mercado Central [Central Market] with merchandise valued at approximately 25,000 Meticais, thanks to his loans with Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner].  He works from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and his best selling products are telephone batteries and covers, and movies. He spends 8000 Meticais on average to purchase these items and makes a profit of 2500 Meticais per week. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some in his bank account. His nephew helps out by giving him around 1000 Meticais each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Daniel's 3rd loan, for the amount of 15,000 Meticais. He plans to use this money to buy cell phone batteries, DVDs and CDs, and other items, in order to increase his range of products. His earlier loans, for 5000 and 10,000 Meticais, were used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nDaniel is confident that he will be able to repay the loan ahead of schedule and take out a new loan to cover the legal fees needed for his land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":648521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is involved in providing taxi services for seven years.  This type of business is in high demand, and taxi services require diligent car care.  Constant replacement of auto parts, oil changes, going through auto inspections require significant funds because a taxi driver is responsible for the life of his passengers.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

F. is 20 years old and has just recently opened her own business selling new women's and children's clothing. When Edita first began selling clothing eight months ago, she found it difficult to obtain capital to invest in her business. And so, two weeks ago, she opted to take out her first loan from Kiva and Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nWith this new access to capital and credit, Edita will finally be able to buy larger quantities of merchandise, including women's tops, blouses, and pants and children's clothing. With her new loan, Edita hopes to begin selling women's shoes and sandals as well.\r\n\r\nOnce her loan is fully funded, Edita will travel several hours by bus (called a guagua) to the larger city of Higuey on the eastern coast to buy her merchandise. She will then sell her wares to her neighbors in the Villa Guerrero neighborhood of El Seybo, which lies in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nRevenues from Edita's clothing business will help supplement what her husband earns working for a local construction company, and will also support the family's two children: a 4-year-old son and a 3-month-old daughter.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the family lives in relatively difficult circumstances: they have no electricity in the home, and the 3-month-old girl currently has an untreated skin infection over much of her body. Furthermore, the family, like the majority of their neighbors in Villa Guerrero, is of Haitian descent, which means it is generally more difficult for them to secure economic and political rights as compared to Dominican citizens.\r\n\r\nWith these challenges in mind, Edita recognizes the importance of her clothing business to her family's well-being. She has hopes to keep selling more clothing in the future so that her children may eventually attend school and have better lives.\r\n\r\nHere, Edita is pictured with her fellow borrowers in La Buena Fe (The Good Faith) Bank of Hope, Group 11. She appears second from the left, along with her daughter.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily used products in the local community. Rammynel has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rammynel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rammynel is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP to be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rammynel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She sells various products including books, clothing for children as well as for adults, cleaning products and personal hygiene products. She also has a photocopying machine.\r\n\r\nTeresita plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of inventory that she will sell in her store. She says that her lack of access to working capital (i.e. loans from formal lending institutions) has hindered her ability to expand her business, gain more clients and increase revenues.\r\n\r\nTeresita organizes her day in the following manner: she wakes up early and cleans the house and store. If a client passes by, she opens up (no earlier than 6 a.m.) and the day begins. She stays open all day until 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nTeresita\u2019s main goal is to expand her business, fill her store with a variety of products and increase her revenues. A main obstacle for Teresita is that she lives in a rural area with a small population, which makes clients hard to come
