The business that he created was an all encompassing furniture rental, rent-to-own, and direct sale retail store. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he has four employees, two of whom are members of his family. He says that this is one of the most important aspects of his business. He loves the opportunity the business gives him to employ individuals in his community, especially members of his family. The store has been very successful since its opening and recently Marlon moved locations to a bigger space. However, with this move, there has been a slowing of business because many people do not know the new location.

He has a mill (\"tahoun\") and has been involved in this business for 10 years. He purchases grain then sells the flour to his customers after milling. He was provided for by his father so that he was able to open his business. \r\n\r\nMohammed is an incredibly hard-working man and as a result has a lot of experience. In addition, this is the main source of his income. On the other hand, through lots of effort, he has managed to grind his customer`s grain, i.e., he provides them with a service to put food on their tables. \r\n\r\nRecently, Mohammed took out a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase grain for his business. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to improve his standard of living.

She lives in the southwestern part of the city of Barranquilla.  She has been selling women's shoes for 2 years since she stopped working as a salesperson in a department store.  She received her severance pay and started her own business adventure, investing five hundred thousand pesos COP in the purchase of women's shoes.  She took advantage of the fact that she had friends who were going to a popular festival and needed shoes for that occasion, and that's how she started her business.  Today she has an established customer base, referred to her through her work and the high quality of the products she sells. \r\n\r\nLiz's dream is to expand her business so that she has sufficient income, which she will use to purchase her own home and make it possible for her 2 children to get an education.  Her children are ages 2 and less than one year.  They are the drivers behind her persistent work and that of her husband.  Her greatest challenge right now is that she doesn't have sufficient capital to respond to market demand.  For this reason she has come to credikiva. This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which she will use to purchase women's shoes to fill orders that her best clients have placed to wear on Mother's Day and to give as gifts to the most marvelous person on Earth.  She believes her investment will be successful because it responds to market demand, which ensures that she will sell her product and serve her most profitable customers.  When this happens she will have a profit margin of no less than 32%, so we predict her business will grow.\r\n\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1084118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase women's shoes to fill orders.

Her business is selling products that she promotes through specialist guides or catalogs.  She started this business in 1995 when she stopped working for a company and used her severance pay to start up her own business venture.  She bought merchandise in other cities in Colombia and started selling it on credit in Barranquilla.  Although things went very well, she soon became pregnant and, on her husband's suggestion, stopped working in her business.  However, as her son grew up she started working in the business again with renewed vigor and a lot of life experience.  She sold products through different magazines which she was offered at her door and, as a result of her sales ability, she managed to increase her customer base and also her purchasing power.  Although she sells a small amount of stock, her business does very well because she manages to sell everything she buys, especially during seasons such as the one which is approaching when people celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day.  At these times of year, she does not have enough working capital to fill her orders in a timely manner and thereby strengthen her income.  In her business, Nuris' main customers are neighbors, family members and people who she has been recommended to.  She sells on credit and collects payments every two weeks.  She also buys on credit every 21 days.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Nuris' first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy perfume, cosmetics, clothing and general accessories.  This will enable her to fill the orders of her most faithful customers and she will continue earning a little more.  Her goal for the future is to have display cabinets, in which to display her products, and well-equipped premises that offer her and her customers a comfortable environment.  In this way, she hopes to make enough income that she can offer her children the possibility of studying at university and becoming successful people."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1084140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, cosmetics, clothing and general accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113079},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130690},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133740},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":136860},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140054},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":143322},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146666},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150088},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153590},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":157174},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160841},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183896}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":422754,"name":"Junaline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Junaline is 28 years old and married with one child.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Her purchases are paid for in cash, taking care to cover her accounts, and are made in Barranquilla, some 20 minutes from the municipality where she lives. \r\n\r\nLuz' goal for the future is to acquire her own home, but her biggest challenge is to acquire sufficient resources to attend to her market, to grow as an entrepreneur, and to be able to achieve her dreams. This is why she is seeking a Kiva loan, the 1st financing she has requested through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics and hens.

All\u00ed desarrolla dos actividades productivas que le generan ingresos; por un lado vende cosm\u00e9ticos sobre pedidos de sus clientes y por otro comercializa repuestos el\u00e9ctricos y  electr\u00f3nicos. Su idea de incursionar en esta \u00faltima actividad naci\u00f3 porque vio la oportunidad de vender este tipo de productos, debido a que  su c\u00f3nyuge es t\u00e9cnico de aparatos el\u00e9ctricos, que gradualmente van siendo reemplazado por la electr\u00f3nica.  Posteriormente en el marco de generar mayores ingresos que contribuyeran al bienestar de su hogar, incursion\u00f3 en la venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos mediante gu\u00edas  especializadas, lo que en la actualidad le ha generado m\u00e1s de 40 clientes fijos, que gradualmente refieren a nuevos compradores, haciendo crecer los pedidos. En su negociaci\u00f3n sus clientes al hacer la solicitud del producto entregan una cuota inicial del 50% y la otra parte la pagan a cr\u00e9dito en plazos que oscilan entre 10 y 15 d\u00edas. De esta manera hay clientes que no cuentan con su cuota inicial  de pedido y ella requiere tener un fondo de efectivo para financiar su cartera de cr\u00e9dito y ofrecer unas mejores condiciones al cliente, lo cual se convierte en su principal desafi\u00f3, porque no cuenta con el capital de trabajo para lograr este prop\u00f3sito.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva,  primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 cosm\u00e9ticos que llegaron en su gu\u00eda con buenos descuentos y repuestos electr\u00f3nicos con los que surtir su otro negocio.

Mientras esto ocurre, maneja una rentabilidad sobre las ventas no menores del 35% y una rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 40 d\u00edas, indicadores financieros desde los cuales auguramos su crecimiento empresarial y el inicio de poder tener recursos que produzcan nuevas utilidades para mejorar su vivienda  y con ello  aumentar su calidad de vida familiar. ","en":"Liseth is 25 years old.  She lives with her husband and three children, who are between 2 and 6 years old, in the town of Malambo, twenty minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  There she carries out two business activities which make her income.  She sells cosmetics to order and also sells electrical and electronic parts.  She decided to venture into the latter business because she saw the opportunity to sell this type of products as her husband fixes electrical equipment that is gradually being replaced by electronics.  Later, in order to make more income and contribute towards the well-being of her household, she started selling cosmetics through specialized catalogs.  She has gained more than 40 regular customers for this business and they gradually refer new customers to her which increases her orders.  When her customers request a product, they hand over an initial down payment of 50%.  They pay the rest of the sum on credit, making payments every 10 to 15 days.  There are some customers who do not have the money to make the initial down payment for their order, however, and Liseth needs to have a cash fund available so that she can finance her credit portfolio and offer her customers better terms and conditions.  This has become her main challenge as she doesn't have enough working capital to achieve it.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) which she will use to buy cosmetics from her catalog that are available at good discounts.  She will also buy electronic parts that experience tells her have an easier turnover.  She will also make the most of discounts which will allow her to sell to her customers on a better installment plan.  This will boost her number of customers.  In the meantime, she has a profitability on sales of at least 35% and an accounts receivable turnover period of 40 days.

She is the motivation to work persistently every day to create conditions that will lead to a better wellbeing.\r\n\r\nAdriana works at two activities.  On the one hand she offers beauty services and on the other she sells fried food.  She learned both activities empirically many years ago and it was since 2000 that she started to use them to earn income.\r\n\r\nHer clientele are neighbors, friends, family members and people referred by current customers.  The sale of fried food takes place at her sister\u2019s house in another neighborhood in the city Monday through Friday from 6am to 11:30am and she works as a stylist whenever her clientele requires it.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to become a professional stylist and to expand her profit margin investing to attract more customers but her working capital is her greatest challenge to reach this dream.  This is the reason why she\u2019s calling on her Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy beauty supplies and modern equipment like a hair straightening iron and a hair dryer.  She will also buy fried products to continue strengthening her two income-producing businesses she plans to use to improve her family\u2019s future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1084160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty supplies, a straightening iron and a hair dryer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T19:00:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":52316},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59759},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61153},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62580},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64041},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":65535},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67064},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68629},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":70230},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":71869},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73546},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83278}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.06,"local_amount":52316,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":54545.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141268},{"amount":35.48,"local_amount":59759,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":62306.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338752},{"amount":36.31,"local_amount":61153,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63759.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395308},{"amount":37.16,"local_amount":62580,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":65247.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775114},{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":64041,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":66770.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387098},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":65535,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":68328.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993953},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":67064,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":69922.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130316},{"amount":87.29,"local_amount":147021,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":153287.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706030},{"amount":130.94,"local_amount":220531,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":229931.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968387}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T04:08:32Z","paid_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":419920,"name":"Ricardo Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Su mayor sue\u00f1o en la vida siempre ha sido la superaci\u00f3n personal, salir adelante, alcanzar sus metas y sue\u00f1os y ayudar a las personas.

It took its present form 3 years ago, because she gathered together all the practical knowledge from her parents and learned how to add embellishments. Later she was trained at the National Learning Service (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA), an organization supported by the national government, and there she strengthened her administrative and marketing knowledge. Currently, her business is officially registered, since she recognized the importance of being registered with the local Chamber of Commerce, so she can market to other institutions and negotiate her prices with suppliers. On average, she produces 160 dozen pairs of shoes, and she sells them to stores at wholesale prices, and these in turn pay her within 30 days. In her business, she works with people from her immediate family, generating about 15 part-time jobs, in addition to many people who work from their homes decorating the shoes. Currently, she is applying for this Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization which she got to know when it arrived in her neighborhood in a mobile office with commercial advisors. Her goal is to be able to acquire machinery to strengthen her technical infrastructure and increase the volume of sales, in order to gain discounts, and this is just what she will achieve with the purchase of leather, linings, rhinestones and other supplies to make new shoe designs and to continue on her path toward prosperity as expected.

That is where she has her sewing business.  This business activity is a family tradition that her mother started seven years ago.  For health reasons, her mother transferred the business to Claudia, who has been taking the reins of this small business little by little.\r\n\r\nFour years ago she learned specialized sewing technique for women\u2019s dresses and skirts.  She sells them to Christian clothing stores.  The skirts are elegant, roomy, and long, which conforms to the education that the churches give to the diverse congregations that are in Malambo.\r\n\r\nClaudia got married a year ago.  She has continued to be in charge of her business in order to help her husband establish the family\u2019s well-being now and in the future.  She also wants to fulfill her dream of finishing her college education.  She is studying the career of public accounting.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making clothes, Claudia generates other income through the sale of products by catalog.  She promotes her sales among her neighbors, family members, and study companions, who are her principle market.\r\n\r\nClaudia is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and interfacing in greater volume in order to get discounts.  She will also buy a machine to use to improve her productive times.  \r\n\r\nHer goals are to organize her shop and to even generate jobs, to complete her university education, and to have her own house.  While she works hard to fulfill her dreams, she manages a  30-day accounts receivable turnover rate while her inventories rotate every 5 days.  Her profit margin is no less than 16%. Using these financial indicators we project growth for her business.

Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Abiba was able to grow her business to yield a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  Today her product selection is limited, and this is why Abiba requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

She has a sewing workshop in her home, which is her main business, and she also earns money through selling cold cuts, with which she adds to her family income.  She started her business three years ago with the purchase of a sewing machine, which she purchase with the severance that she obtained from working in the French Zone in Barranquilla city.  This is where she gained her most valued experience which she later turned into her current independent business.\r\n\r\nHer main products that she makes are sheets and bed linens, and she also makes a line of women's clothing.  On the weekends, she works selling cold cuts, which she purchases in order to sell to her neighbors.  This has gone very well for her. \r\n\r\nShe is currently preparing to receive a Kiva loan, which will be her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to purchase raw materials and supplies for sewing, and also will invest it in her other business of cold cuts to position herself with her customers and earn additional income which will help her household even more.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to have infrastructure for her workshop and operators, and to be able to reach a better marketplace.  This would allow her to achieve her dream for her son, which is for him to be able to undertake professional studies.  Her major challenge is that the space in her house is not sufficient to allow for growth and a more comfortable working environment.  With only her own working capital, she cannot achieve her goals for the future, which is why she has come for a Kiva loan.  The lender anticipates a successful investment as Crindy is an expert in the technical side of sewing and in the marketplace in which she operates."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1084193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase raw materials and supplies for sewing. and cold cuts to bolster her other business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crindy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70062},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74807},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76553},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78339},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80167},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82038},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83952},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85911},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87915},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89967},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92066},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98223}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":70062,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":70741.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141269},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":74807,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":75532.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101140},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":76553,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77295.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338754},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":78339,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":79098.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395310},{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":80167,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80944.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775116},{"amount":47.17,"local_amount":82038,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82833.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387100},{"amount":97.67,"local_amount":169863,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":171510.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130318},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":87915,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88767.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519201},{"amount":161.15,"local_amount":280256,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":282974.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071042}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T01:34:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":422801,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita is 65 years old, married with 3 children.

He is married and is a farmer. He works planting tomatoes, corn and beans. He completed studies up until his third year of secondary school. He started this work 10 years ago with his own business by planting tomatoes with the money that he got from selling two oxen that he inherited from his father. He has been working as a farmer since he was 24 years old and since then has been working hard without the need for a loan. Now he needs a loan for working capital because he invested the money he had saved into a cucumber crop. He has his wife's and his father-in-law's support in his business.

Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual Digna comprara mercanc\u00eda para surtir su negocio especialmente detalles para el hogar,  que su clientela compra para esta fecha especial y papeler\u00eda, para que empaquen sus regalos. \u00c9l \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n radica en que ser\u00e1 aplicada a la microempresa en una \u00e9poca de mayor demanda de los productos que se ofrecer\u00e1n en la miscel\u00e1nea y que Digna al comprarlos lo har\u00e1 en mayor volumen que el acostumbrado y ganar\u00e1 descuentos especiales.

She has a \u201cmiscellanea\u201d (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods) where she sells paper goods, cosmetics, perfume, shoes, and household products.  She started her business as a way to contribute to the household income.  She was selling clothes, and she gradually came to sell shoes.  With her profits she bought display cases, and now she sells a little of everything according to the needs, likes, and interests of her clientele.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is that she does not have enough working capital to respond to the demand in a growing market.  This is especially true during times like the approaching Mother\u2019s Day where there is a greater volume of sales.  Digna needs to be prepared for these times by having inventory in her display cases to impact her market and to have good sales.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason that she turns to her Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Digna will use her loan to buy merchandise, especially household items, to stock her business.  She will do this so that her customers will make purchases for this special day, and so that they will buy paper to wrap the presents.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment stems from the fact that it will be used in the small business during a season of great demand for the products that will be offered in her miscellanea.  Digna will buy the merchandise in greater volume than she usually does, and she will qualify for special discounts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1084211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise, especially household items, to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-08T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-07T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Digna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42249},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45957},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47029},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":48127},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49250},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50399},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51575},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52778},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54010},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58626}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.35,"local_amount":42249,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":44513.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101141},{"amount":27.57,"local_amount":45957,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":48420.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338755},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":47029,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":49549.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395311},{"amount":28.88,"local_amount":48127,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50706.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775117},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":49250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":51889.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387101},{"amount":30.24,"local_amount":50399,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53100.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993955},{"amount":30.94,"local_amount":51575,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":54339.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130319},{"amount":99.25,"local_amount":165414,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":174280.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519202}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T06:17:16Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":422429,"name":"Ndanaiya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the Ndanaiya Group from Koidu, a city in eastern Sierra Leone.

She tells us that the standard of living in her community is subsistence level, the majority of the inhabitants work on their own and raise and sell small animals as well as farm.  Rosa\u2019s house is in Pedregal Alto village in Tambogrande district, Piura department.  This village only has basic electrical service and water drawn from a well and all the families in the village live this way.\r\nRosa\u2019s business is raising, fattening and selling small animals such as: poultry and pigs and she keeps them in small corrals outside her house.  She also tells us that she sells them in local markets or to wholesale animal buyers. It's worth noting that Rosa has been in the business for 4 years and this has allowed her to develop an established customer base.\r\nNow Rosa would like to increase her inventory for sale, by fattening and marketing the animals (pigs and poultry) since this is a good business for her area.  Thus she is requesting a new loan of 1800 new sols to buy balanced food for fattening, and to improve the corrals.  These activities will help her raise the standard of living for her

Right now she has her workshop in her house and works with her sister in a line of casual clothing for the whole family. She also has an industrial line because she makes uniforms for businesses and schools. Her goal is to have her workshop totally organized and have her business registry which will allow her to grow her aspirations for new markets. Her biggest challenge is that her working capital isn't enough to make her dream come true. This is the reason she has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy an industrial overlock sewing machine to do better finishings on the clothing she makes and improve her production time. Her reason for success with this investment is that it will facilitate her making another type of clothing, increase her market and improve her time saving process, which will translate into money.

She works as an office assistant and she lives with her husband and her 2 children in their small old house which is in the ger (a Mongolian traditional yurt) district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. She has been doing her job for the last 7 years and her salary does not usually meet her family's necessities. Her husband works as a plumber and also runs a taxi service with his car. The taxi service is very beneficial to increase the family's income for the necessary expenses, such as the school fees and other expenses of their children. The garage is needed to properly house her husband's car. Before, her husband used to rent space from the rental garage and it had been very expensive. Building a garage will allow the family to use their car for the taxi business and family use in the future.

The quality of life in the community is one of subsistence.  The majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who work in the trade and care of small animals and some also work in agriculture.  Maria lives in the farm town Las Adelinas in the Cayalt\u00ec district in the department of Piura.  She only has basic electricity.  It is also worth mentioning that in this farm area, approximately 120 families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nMaria works in the commercial activity of raising and vaccinating livestock, selling milk and raising fowl.  These animals are raised outside of her house in external corrals.  Additionally, Maria has 18 years of experience in this line of work, which has allowed her to maintain an established clientele in her business.  She sells her milk at Cayalti market. Her spouse also works his small farm where he has cultivated 1.5 [has] of corn which is phenologically healthy.  Her domestic partner arduously supports her in the activities he does, and there is a good familial relationship between them.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Maria has set the goal of expanding her inventory in the raising [of livestock] and the selling of milk.  The reason for this is that it is a very profitable activity in this area.  Thus, she is asking for a new loan for a total of S\/.3000 nuevos soles, which will be used to invest in the purchase of a motorcycle-taxi to transport products (milk) and to repair the corrals for her animals.  In time this will allow her to better her quality of life and that of her family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1084259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi for her business and to repair her livestock corrals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-09T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-08T04:00:04Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eca Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":207.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":233.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":247.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":252},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":260.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":270.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":276.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":289.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hannah Katz","image":1962381}},{"id":421090,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisca  es una mujer que tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil conviviente, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge  y sus tres hijos en casa propia.

I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I was born second in a family of four siblings including two brothers and two sisters: an elder sister named Berryl; a younger sister called Tinna, currently in her third form in secondary school; and Gabriel, the last born of the family, who is a standard 8 candidate at primary school.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University because I believe that it is the institution that will offer me the best opportunity for quality education. I draw inspiration from my elder sister, who is an alumnus of the University; her colleagues who went to Strathmore with her, and my former classmates who are currently studying at Strathmore. They motivated me to seek admission to Strathmore University, and I am so grateful to God that I was granted entrance and will therefore commence my first year of study on June 25, 2012.\r\n\r\nI am taking out this Kiva loan to fund my degree course through University. This is because my family is currently unable to pool enough resources to see me through my degree. Even though Strathmore University seems an expensive option given my family\u2019s financial status, I do believe that education is a worthy and noble investment in one\u2019s future, and not just an expense as some may perceive. \r\n\r\nMy father, the family\u2019s sole breadwinner, was rendered jobless along with thousands of others when his factory was shut down three years ago and placed under receivership. He now tries his hand at farming. He has established a small tree seedling nursery. He uses the returns to look after the family\u2019s welfare and contribute to my siblings' school fees. My mother, who has been a hairdresser for almost 15 years now, uses her meager earnings to feed the family. My elder sister Berryl, who is currently juggling school and work, is the one who helped my parents put me through secondary school. She is also financing my younger siblings\u2019 education and paying her own fees for a degree course. Her finances are stretched far too thin to pay for my university fees. This has left me with a Kiva loan as my only option of getting a chance to study at university.\r\n\r\nAt Strathmore, I wish to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications, which will enable me to achieve my dream career in the field of Information Technology. This is something that has kept me motivated and inspired me to put in the effort needed to excel in my secondary school education. I want to pursue a leading career in the ICT sector after I graduate from my course, and I hope to make a positive contribution to the development of Kenya. It is through ICT that Kenya can follow the path toward attaining its visions and goals. I also hope that I will be able to further my education and attain a Master's in the same field. I hope to also assist my younger siblings (and anybody else I can) to get the best education so that they may also have a successful and bright future. Furthermore, I am so grateful to the Kiva program as it seeks to help put needy students through school, ultimately leading the way toward raising a nation with fulfilled dreams \u2013 a nation which is successful, grateful, charitable and unified.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1089696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This area is also known for its food and the warmth of its people. \r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place that one can meet Sra. Edda.  She is 50 years old, separated from her spouse, and has five children.  Three of them are grown and the other two (ages 16 and 14) are high school students.  Three of her children live with her, as well as two grandchildren (ages 7 and 3) who are in elementary school and under her care.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdda intends to earn a living so that she and her children can get ahead.  She is a merchant who sells all types of clothing.  Edda generates her sales by going door-to-door, but she also sells from her home since that is where she has a few display cases.  Her daughters help with her sales and even deliver merchandise to their school.  They often come home saying that their classmates want to buy some article of clothing.  Edda works every day around the clock.  She extends credit to her customers and collects payment every eight days.  Her merchandise is purchased in Guayaquil as needed.  She has been in this business for three years and has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more merchandise such as trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.  Edda has been with her Communal Bank for more than 10 years and enjoys being a member because of the help that the loans have given her.  As a result, she has been able to help her children move forward.  Her dream is to see her children finish their studies and become successful professionals.

She lives in the northwest region of Bamenda in Cameroon (Africa). She lives with her entire family in a two-bedroom house.\r\n\r\nThe passing away of Perpetua's husband was one of the most difficult moments in her life. Thieves broke into her house and pigs were stolen from her. She has had difficulty many times in paying her rent.   \r\n\r\nPerpetua has benefited from loans from GHAPE two times previously. This will be her third loan from GHAPE. She has been in GHAPE since 2009 and has been very successful in her past businesses. \r\n\r\nPerpetua plans to use her loan for the purchase of palm wine, beer and seedlings. She thinks her business will succeed because she has so many customers and her beer store is situated in a good area in her community. Also, she has been doing this business for three years.\r\n\r\nShe intends to use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees, buy some basic necessities for her children and build a house.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multifaceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1088872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

opportunities for paid employment.  For that reason for these women there are no other options than to find a means of self-employment.  In this case, Mrs. Incris made the decision to begin a small commercial activity offering her clients the possibility of giving them a 60 day credit.  She began four years ago with credit from her providers.  However, from one moment to the next the principal provider closed her credit, and for that reason she is asking for a loan in order to reinforce the capital for her work and to be able to continue with her commercial activity.  Her work has helped with her domestic economic situation, since she still has a young child, which makes it impossible for her to work outside of the home since then she would have to use what she earned to pay for childcare for her three year old.  Among her future plans is the goal of making improvements on her home, since where she lives is a public housing unit, and thus comes only with the basics with the idea that the inhabitants will make improvements to the home.

Thirty-five years ago, when she was a little girl, she started learning about farming.  So far, farming has been her main income.  \r\n\r\nTen years ago she noticed the need that people have for wood.  Then she started to sell wood wholesale.  Together she and her husband get the trunks, and they choose to sell them as supports and as firewood.  Her work requires a lot of physical strength in addition to always being ready to buy the wood.  There are a lot of opportunities when there are sales at moderate prices.  \r\n\r\nFlor considers her work to be profitable because she can always sell her products at a good price.  She has plans to expand her sales areas into other cities.  In order to do this, she will put forth great effort to increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Santo Domino communal bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP.  She considers her group to be a supportive team that is very united.  She is very happy about that.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la que lucha con todas sus fuerzas para mantener vivo el negocio que por muchos a\u00f1os le ha proporcionado lo necesario para sobrevivir.  Vale la pena mencionar que en cuanto a competencia, Rosibel no tiene problemas ya que no hay muchos negocios parecidos en la zona. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su negocio, es decir,  poder tener la capacidad de cubrir una mayor demanda que le genere mayores ingresos. Esto la ha llevado a tomar la decisi\u00f3n de solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en la materia prima necesaria (ma\u00edz y harinas) al por mayor para seguir produciendo las deliciosas tortillas.  Espera lograr su objetivo de cubrir una mayor demanda que le genere una mejora en los ingresos percibidos de tal forma que su calidad de vida y la de su familia puedan mejorar.\n","en":"Rosibel is 48 years old and lives in her own home with her family, which consists of her life companion and their five children.  Two of her children are studying.  Family is the most important thing to Rosibel, so she works hard to feed her family each day and provide for their essential needs.  Rosibel sells delicious tortillas.  She has been in this business for many years and has gained plenty of experience.  She has a few customers who are very loyal to the products that she offers.  Her dream is to see her children become professionals so that they will have better conditions than she had.  This is why she invests all of her effort into maintaining the life of her business, which has provided her the means to survive for many years.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is worth mentioning that in terms of the competition, Rosibel does not face this problem because there are not many businesses like hers that are in the area.  Her dream is to expand her business.  In other words, she wants to have the capacity to keep up with the growing demand and be able to generate more income.  Therefore, Rosibel decided to request a loan from Apoyo Integral so that she can invest in supplies (corn and flour) in bulk and continue to produce her delicious tortillas.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosibel hopes to achieve her goal of meeting the growing demand so that she can have more revenue and improve her quality of life and that of her family.
