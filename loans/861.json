Miris\u2019 strength consists in her knowing her business perfectly and that she\u2019s had experience preparing and selling fried products because she used to sell them for four years at stores and at a fixed location before starting this business.\n\nHer business has great growth potential and she\u2019s aware of that because she\u2019s firmly determined to develop it to continue offering her children the opportunity to attain professional, specialized studies.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1084149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy display cases, mobile phones, chargers, room dividers and to sell paper goods an fried snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-09T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-08T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64887},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70601},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72248},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73934},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75659},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77425},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":79231},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86015}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.85,"local_amount":64887,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":66465.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338748},{"amount":41.18,"local_amount":70601,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":72318.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395307},{"amount":119.23,"local_amount":204401,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":209374.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993951},{"amount":151.74,"local_amount":260111,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":266440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364528006}],"funded_date":"2012-05-13T15:39:09Z","paid_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":421034,"name":"Esterlina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esterlina de 29 a\u00f1os de edad vive en el municipio de Malambo, muy cerca a la ciudad de Barranquilla, con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus  4 hijas en las edades de 7,8,9 y 10 a\u00f1os.

She lives with her spouse and two children in a house that they own. Quality of life in the community is at subsistence level and the majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who make their livings breeding and selling smaller animals. Some also make a living through agriculture. Margarita lives in her own house in Tranca Fanupe, a small town in the M\u00f3rrope district of the \"departamento\" of Lambayaque. They have basic services such as electricity and get their water from a handmade well. All the local families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nMargarita makes her living breeding, fattening, trading, and selling smaller animals such as poultry and goats. She raises these animals in corrals outside her house. However, she mentions that the sale of these animals takes place in a local market and that she has wholesale buyers of the animals. It is worth noting that Margarita has twelve years of experience in this business, which has permitted her to maintain an established clientele.

Her job is very unusual, as she has been a midwife for more than 18 years. She says that she learned on her own and little by little perfected her techniques. She is recognized by Mexico's social welfare institute, which has given training to provide a better service in her community. Gilberta says that every year many women come to her for her midwife service and to keep track of their pregnancies. She says that through this work she is proud to bring children into the world. She plans to buy bandages, cotton, gauze, alcohol, pain medicines, surgical soap and other items. She says that this loan will help her out a lot because she will have the necessary materials to provide a good service to her community. Gilberta's goal is to keep helping her community and to have a special birthing room that she would like to equip with ultrasounds so the women can see how their babies are coming along. The other six members of the group are Lidia, Ofelia, Marisol, Fabi\u00e1n, Sandra and Juan Carlos.

She lives in her own home with her children and husband. It is mentioned that the quality of life in her community is that of subsistence. The majority of the inhabitants are independent workers who make a living in agriculture, livestock and raising small animals, and some also are involved in commerce. Roxana lives in the hamlet of Escute, district of Pacora, department of Lamayeque in a home that only has basic electric and water services. Nearly all of the families in the hamlet live under these conditions. Roxana makes a living raising and selling small animals and also sells beverages (soft drinks, beer and chica de jora, a traditional local drink) out of her home, where she tends to faithful customers. She has two years of experience, which has allowed her to maintain a clientele in both businesses. Her husband is a barber and also arduously supports Roxana in her activities as part of a good relationship between them. Currently, Roxana wants to expand the inventory of her small businesses since they are very lucrative ones for her area. It's for this reason she is requesting a new loan from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa, which she plans to use to purchase animals (goats and poultry) and to stock her beverage business a little bit more. In time, this will allow her to improve her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1085782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase animals, feed and beverages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pacora - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-10T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-09T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":148.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":175.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":179.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":185.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":196.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.41,"local_amount":282.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":288.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423762},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":152.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317181},{"amount":57.62,"local_amount":148.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374000},{"amount":62.06,"local_amount":160.15,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":163.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385244},{"amount":63.47,"local_amount":163.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368838},{"amount":64.6,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":170.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977884},{"amount":68,"local_amount":175.5,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-25T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115074},{"amount":69.5,"local_amount":179.35,"processed_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506750},{"amount":71.79,"local_amount":185.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":189.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058703},{"amount":74.67,"local_amount":192.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":196.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804267},{"amount":76.14,"local_amount":196.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T08:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":200.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364512446}],"funded_date":"2012-05-31T19:59:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T08:48:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":423368,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is married with one child who is 3 years old.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She works to help her husband with household expenses and provide a better life for the younger two children who still live with them. They are both currently in high school. Maria Eugenia is requesting the loan to invest in ingredients to increase her sales. She also plans to purchase what she needs to start selling more variety, like tacos and gorditas, and in this way increase her profits. Her long-term goal is to have a well-established restaurant on an avenue near her home and to tend to it alongside her family so they can all stay united.

He says that little by little his activity is prospering because he has purchased much-needed tools for his work, and that will continue when he gets a tool to help him put down flooring or tiles in bathrooms and kitchens. He says that he is going to benefit from this loan because he will purchase the tool he has been lacking to grow his construction business. One of his dreams is to build himself a brick house and to purchase a truck that he could use to more easily commute to Mexico City and not have to pay to freight his tools. The other five members are M\u00e1xima, Mar\u00eda Blanca, Esmeralda, Isabel and Mariana, who plan to invest the loan in the purchase of materials to make crafts, to purchase ingredients to cultivate avocado and to farm trout.

Together they have formed a family with their four children who are in school. Previously, Lourdes was in a large group. This time, she has asked for an individual loan to invest in her business selling chickens. With the loan she will buy more chickens and some candies to sell. She doesn't know how many because she buys little by little.  \r\n\r\nLourdes has had the business for 7 years. She buys the live chickens at a lower price to later sell them at a higher price. She almost always has a lot of orders and sells from her house or in the nearby communities. When we visited her she was very happy since she was able to tell us that thanks to Holy Week she was able to sell a lot. Nonetheless, Lourdes' biggest problem is when there is no event and almost no sales and if worst of all she ordered a lot of chickens, they go unsold. This doesn't discourage her, though, because if she doesn't sell today, tomorrow will be better.   \r\n\r\nOne of Lourdes's goals is to improve her and her family's quality of life. Above all, to improve her children's education. She wants them to finish college so they can have a better life. She is very happy and grateful with the loan since with her earnings she can buy shoes, clothes, and children's clothes. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1084148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens.

The name of their group was chosen after the members had a difficult time deciding whether to name their group after some type of flower or plant.  They ended up choosing the name \"Aroma\" after it was suggested jokingly by a gentleman who is no longer with the group.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Adela is the group representative.  She is 50 years old and a single mother with three dependent children.  Do\u00f1a Adela raises and sells animals such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, pigs, and sheep.  This time she is requesting a loan to buy four pigs and lumber so that she can repair her pig sty that has a roof that leaks when it rains.  She also acquired four heads of sheep and hay for them to feed on, so she will also use her loan to pay for them since they were purchased on credit.  Do\u00f1a Adela is in this business because it is customary for people in her town to raise animals.  This business also gives her a way of helping her children get ahead.  She learned how to take care of animals from her mother.  For Do\u00f1a Adela, the best part is being able to consume the animals she raises because they do not have as much fat as those sold at the markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of Do\u00f1a Adela's greatest challenges is dealing with situations when her animals get sick.  If the animals die, she loses revenue and her investment capital.  In addition, the cost of veterinary care and medicines for her animals is very expensive.  One of Do\u00f1a Adela's goals is to see her children finish their education and find a job in their field of study.  She is very pleased because her son, Jos\u00e9 Luis, recently finished his degree in Education.  Do\u00f1a Adela is extremely grateful for this loan because it will allow her to cover the household expenses and pay for her children's education.  Thanks to her previous loans, she was able to open a small stand where she could sell pork rinds and sweets.  The profits were used to pay for the expenses of her youngest son, Mario Alberto, who is studying in the fourth grade.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Adela and the rest of her group are very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the loan that has been granted.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her husband is a mechanic and she strongly supports him in his business.  The two have a good family relationship.\r\nCurrently, Vitalia has decided to expand the inventory of her commercial establishment (her small store), which is very profitable in her area.  So she is requesting a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 nuevos soles ($575 USD) to be invested in the purchase of merchandise (clothing and groceries).  Vitalia's goal is to purchase a space in the market in the near future, which, in time, will allow her to continue improving her own and her family's quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1085685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-10T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-09T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vitalia Margara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":111.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":122.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":134.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":138.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":423413,"name":"Patience S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is 30 years old.

She is married and lives with her son and her husband in their own house. It is said that the quality of life in the community is subsistence level. The majority of the residents are independent workers who work in selling and raising small animals, and some of them also work in agriculture. Victoria lives in her own house in the village of San Mart\u00edn in the district of Tambogrande in the department of Piura. She has basic electrical service and water is provided by an artesian well. All the families who live in this area also live in these conditions.\r\n\r\nVictoria's work is the business of raising, fattening, and selling small animals such as barnyard fowl and sheep. She raises the animals in pens outside her home. Nevertheless, she sells them in the local market and\/or to wholesale buyers of animals. It should be emphasized that Victoria has 10 years of experience, which has allowed her to maintain her customers since she is already established in this business. In addition, her husband has planted four hectares with mangoes and lemons which he harvests, and he also supports her financially, where they have a good family relationship.\r\n\r\nNow Victoria has proposed increasing her inventory with regard to commercializing, fattening, and selling animals (sheep and barnyard fowl), since this is a very profitable business in this area. It is because of these circumstances that she is applying to Edpyme Alternativa for a new loan in the amount of 1500 PEN, which will be destined for the purchase of balanced feed to fatten her animals and for the purchase of fertilizer for their crops, which in time will allow her to improve the standard of living of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1085736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy balanced feed to fatten her animals and buy fertilizer for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

They've been together for 23 years and have formed a family with three children, two of whom are already in school while the youngest is not. Guadalupe sells down comforters, sheets and curtains. With the loan requested she will buy some of all of those. Lupita, as she's known in her town, has a store in Tula Hidalgo, and has one employee that helps her to tend to the store. She started her business to help her husband with their household expenses. Her biggest challenge is not being able to be there all the time and leaving her family while she works. She also worries when she doesn't make profits because people are looking for better quality and better prices, but she is confident that the loan will help her to stock her store better and increase her earnings. This business has made her a little calmer because she can cover the costs of her home. \r\n\r\nLupita's goal is to make her business bigger, but above all to see all of her children get a degree and succeed professionally. Guadalupe and the other women are very grateful to FRAC and Kiva because now they will be able to buy what they lack in their businesses to increase profits. Angela, Diana, Blanca, Benita and Elizabeth will buy sheep; Victoria will buy clothing for resale; Benita will buy corn to make tortillas; and Julia will start a jewelry business.

pa\u00eds, Do\u00f1a Olga quien es la representante del grupo nos cuenta que tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 34 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Pablo por el momento ya no tienen ning\u00fan dependiente  todas viven en san pablo Tlachichilpa un lugar donde las personas son muy amables y trabajadoras do\u00f1a Olga se dedica  a la crianza y venta de animales esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar borregos, pollos y ma\u00edz las cantidades son las sabe porque necesita ver los precios, en esta actividad lleva ya 30a\u00f1os desde que era peque\u00f1a sus padres se dedicaban a los mismos es por eso que ella tambi\u00e9n se dedica a lo mismos pero comenta que cundo era m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a los animales de sus padres se los llevaban a pastar ala campo pero los tiempos han cambiado ya no en donde pastar a los animales y tenemos que comprar les todos sus alimentos como, pastura, ma\u00edz molido, etc.\nEl reto m\u00e1s grande que presenta do\u00f1a Olga es cuando sus animales enferman y no tienen que tiene que gastar en el veterinario y medicamento, por ejemplo a los pollos cada mes se les debe comprar un polvo que se llama brebaje y a los borregos hay desparasitarlos.\nLa meta de do\u00f1a Olga es llegar a tener un ahorro para cuando lo necesiten urgentemente tengan de donde tomar ya que su esposos y ella son personas mayores de edad y no pueden conseguir trabajo f\u00e1cilmente.\nElla est\u00e1 muy agradecida porque gracias al cr\u00e9dito ha podido comprar varios animales y siempre ha tratado de ahorra y cuando puede darse un gustito n comprar cosas que necesita lo hace como comprarse zapatos nuevos, rebosos, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Olga y las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con FRAC y KIVA ya que podr\u00e1n invertir en sus actividades Trinidad y Carmen compraran borregos, y Beatriz comprar pollos. \n","en":"The group \u201cLibertad\u201d (Freedom) consists of four cheerful and hardworking women who always enjoy succeeding at everything.  They chose the name of the group because they believe their country is free of slavery.  Apparently Do\u00f1a Olga had the idea of what slavery was like in Mexico.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga is the group representative.  She says that she is 58 years old and has been married to Sr. Pablo for 34 years.  At the moment, they do not have any dependent children.  They all live in San Pablo Tlachichilpa, a place where the people are friendly and hardworking.  Do\u00f1a Olga raises and sells animals.  She is requesting a loan in order to buy sheep, chickens, and corn in large quantities because she knows that the prices have increased.  She has already been in business for 30 years.  When she was a young girl, her parents were in the same line of work.  Her parents would take their animals out to pasture, but times have changed since there is no place for her animals to graze.  Therefore, she must buy food for her animals such as grasses, ground corn, and other types of feed.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga\u2019s greatest challenge is when her animals get sick because she does not have the resources to cover veterinary expenses and medicines.  Each month she has to buy a powdered remedy for her chickens and also have her sheep checked for parasites.  Her goal is to have savings set aside for emergencies.  She and her husband are older, so they are not able to continue working as easily as before.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Olga is very grateful because the loans have enabled her to buy several animals.  She always tries to save, but whenever she is able to treat herself, she buys things that she needs such as new shoes, shawls, and other items.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She claims that business has grown little by little, and what was once a soft drink business has now become a small grocery store.  Her house is located on a road that has many travelers who stop for refreshments; so this increases her sales volume.  What Rosal\u00eda enjoys most about her business is that she can work without neglecting her family.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy soft drinks, cookies, toilet tissue, soap, bleach, juices, rice, beans, sweets, eggs, sugar, salt and soups.  She hopes this investment will help her business grow and increase her profits so she can pay for her daughter's university studies.\r\n\r\nThis group is grateful to the foundation for the support through the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1084292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy soft drinks, cookies, juices, rice, beans, eggs, sugar, salt and soups.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ca\u00f1ada san Antonio,  Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, Oa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-10T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-09T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":178,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Caritina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2787.5,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36006.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317605},{"amount":1393.75,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":18003.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418992},{"amount":1393.75,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":18003.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568568}],"funded_date":"2012-05-12T17:06:58Z","paid_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":421646,"name":"Vladimir Ramon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Vladimir Ramon, caballero esforzado y luchador, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero.

It is a very quiet location known for its nopal (prickly cactus) plantations, from which it gets the name \"La Nopalera\".\r\n\r\nElias is the group's representative.  He tells us that he is 43 years old and married to Teresa.  They have been together for 20 years and have five children who are in school.  Therefore, Elias works hard because his concerned about his children's well-being.  He has been growing \"nopals\" for 12 years, although the idea for the business came from his wife Teresa.  This time he is requesting a loan to buy organic fertilizer called manure.  He says he likes to grow \"nopales\" even though one must be careful when planting them so as not to break the rack, and also in protecting them from the red spider plague, which turns the nopal red and keeps it from producing.    Although this may sound a little alarming for us, Elias says that is not the case since he knows what to do to avoid it.  Elias' biggest problem is money, since he does not have as much to invest as he would like in his nopal crop.  He wants to plant more land and put a structure over his plantation.\r\n\r\nElias' goal is to improve his nopal production and quality.  He is grateful for the loan which has allowed him to increase crop volume, so he not only sells normal nopals, but also as a fruit drink, along with tortilla.

She lives in Travelers, Bamenda, Northwest region, Cameroon. She lives with the entire family in a three-bedroom house.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her father and elder sister was one of the most difficult moments in her life, which brought general poverty to the family, causing her to drop out of school, thus making dependence on her too much. She also has faced the difficulty of educating the family members.   \r\n\r\nGlory has benefited from loans from GHAPE four times and this will be the fifth time she is benefiting from a loan from GHAPE. Glory has been in GHAPE since 2005 and has been very successful in past businesses. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use her loan in the purchase and resale of firewood, the production and sale of yogurt, and poultry and piggery farming. She thinks this  business will succeed because she has so many customers and also because of the ever-increasing demand for these products.   \r\n\r\nShe intends to use the proceeds of this business to pay her children's school fees, buy some basic needs for the family, build her house and solve some of her family's problems.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

One of her favorite things to do is to work.\r\n\r\nLourdes is excited about her 13th loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for approximately seven years, starting with the first loan she received from Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her clothing sales by purchasing pants, skirts, shirts, blouses and other pieces. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business. Lourdes thanks all of you for your support.

She is now requesting a third loan and acts as a leader of a loan group of four members, all of whom are female. Savarn plans to use this loan to buy fertilizer and rice seeds and to hire others to plough and cultivate her rice field. She hopes the loan will enable her to earn more income to feed her family better and especially to expand her current business.

Joyce hopes that in the future she will be able to run two businesses of the same kind. \r\n\r\nJoyce is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Joyce who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1090461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Her husband is Nelson, an employee. Dionafe and Nelson have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nDionafe operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PH 500 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDionafe hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
