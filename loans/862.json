He's in a common law marriage and has two children. He lives with his wife and children in a house he owns. Living conditions in the community are at subsistence levels and most of the people who live there are independent workers. They work in retail, raise small animals and in addition some of them also work in farming. Benito lives in the settlement of Somate Alto, district of Tambogrande, department of Piura. They only get basic electricity services, and water consumption is made through an artesian well. All the families who live there are under these conditions.\r\nBenito's business is raising and selling pigs, sheep and corral poultry. He raises these animals in corrals outside of his home. Benito has 5 years of experience in this business, which has allowed him to maintain his already well-established clientele. He sells his animals to local wholesalers. He also works on his farm, where he has a 1.0-hectare lemon crop, which is in a good phenological state and provides him with more profits.\r\nBenito currently intends to stock up his animal raising and sales business, because it's a very profitable activity in the area. For those reasons he requests a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1.800 nuevos soles. He will use the loan to purchase animal feed and fertilizer for his lemon crop. In time, this will allow him to improve his living conditions."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1086451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for fattening animals and fertilizer for his crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":122.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":131.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":134.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":142.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":147.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":151.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":157.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":159.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":173.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":176.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":422053,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee plants to renew his crops.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to members of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by acquiring supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 9,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSofia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

They live in a city about two hours drive from Jakarta. Their kiosk name is Yuli Cell. The kiosk is named after his wife, because most of the time Yuli is the one that runs the business and waits for customers. Yuli Cell is not the only income they generate for the family, because Sumaryadi himself is an employee. Although Yuli is the one who runs the business, the working capital comes from Sumaryadi. And for Loket Ruma, Sumaryadi will be the one that runs the business with a little help from Yuli. Sumaryadi's family has two children,  aged 10 and 4. \r\n\r\nThe reason why Sumaryadi decided to become a Loket Ruma agent is because he really wants to expand his business. Currently, most of the items Sumaryadi and his wife sell are airtime from all mobile phone providers in Indonesia and starter packs for mobile phone sim cards. They have also started to sell funny stickers (stickers with jokes, funny icons, proverbs, etc.) and cheap perfumes. \r\n\r\nBeing an agent for Loket Ruma means that Sumaryadi will grow his business and become a payment point for bill payment. This loan will serve as a damage deposit for the electronic data capture (EDC) device that as an agent, Sumaryadi will use to enter payments and print receipts for his customers. He is expecting people will use the service to pay monthly installments for things such as cars, motorcycles, and housing. Also, he believes people will come to his kiosk to pay their water and electricity bills, both for prepaid and postpaid electricity bills. \r\n\r\nBasically, he sees this new business program from Ruma as an opportunity that he can take to generate more income. He wants Yuli Cell to be profitable and to be a success in the near future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1084322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to pay for a deposit on an electronic data capture (EDC) terminal for a bill payment business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T02:00:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumaryadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3213679.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172420}],"funded_date":"2012-05-11T18:17:23Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T15:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":423819,"name":"Ligaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Ligaya, 39, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

She mainly offers rugs, from round, palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

Luz Maria.  She is 30 years old and known as a cheerful, friendly, and respectful woman.  Do\u00f1a Luz is best known among her fellow group members for selling seafood, which she has done for four years.  The seafood she sells includes tilapia, sea bass, snapper, and mussels.  She also sells fillets and shrimp upon request.  Luz is happily married to Sr. Jes\u00fas, a hardworking and friendly gentleman who grows corn and works as a bricklayer.  They have a son named Jose Antonio, who she says is her motivation to work every day and get stronger.  What she enjoys most about her business is being able to sell fish in neighboring towns and talking with the residents.  This loan will enable her to buy more fish and shellfish so that she can sell in bulk and in smaller amounts.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGlory Jane hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work from her business.

He lives in his own home with his wife and children.  He says that in his community people live at a subsistence standard of living.  Most of the residents are self-employed and work in retail trade and raising small animals. Also, some of them are farmers.  Anibal lives in the Sinchi Roca settlement in the Tambogrande district, in the department of Piura.  Here the only utility is electricity; he gets his water from a communal tank.  In this place, all of the families live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nAnibal has a business raising and selling pigs, sheep and poultry (10 sheep, 10 pigs and 20 chickens).  He raises these animals in corrals that are outside his home.  It should be noted that Anibal has 2 years of experience in this line of work, and this has enabled him to maintain a well-established customer base.  He sells his animals to the wholesale traders in the area.  Also, his wife has a farm where she has half a hectare planted with lemons.  These are growing well and so will generate some extra income.\r\n\r\nNow Anibal has proposed to expand his inventory of animals, because this is a very profitable business in this area.  For this reason he is requesting a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa for a sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles, which will allow him to invest in the purchase of balanced animal feed and fertilizers for his lemon crop.  Over time, this will allow him to improve his standard of living. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1086471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animal feed and fertilizers for his crops\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anibal Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":109.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":122.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":133.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":139.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":144.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":147.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":211.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":213.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423769},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":111.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":113.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317188},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":112.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":114.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374007},{"amount":45.62,"local_amount":119,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":120.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385251},{"amount":47.09,"local_amount":122.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":124.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368845},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":125.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977891},{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":130.9,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":132.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115080},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":133.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506756},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":139.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":141.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058709},{"amount":112.01,"local_amount":292.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":295.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804272}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T12:44:13Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":423836,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 45 years old and lives in Bardnersville.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nI am Lydia, the second born in a family of three. I have one parent, my mother, and two siblings. My father died nine years ago. My mother is a housewife and also takes care of a few goats and sheep. None of my siblings got a chance to go to school.\r\n\r\nI am from Lodwar in Turkana County. Turkana, in the northern part of Kenya, is a famine-ravaged region and most girls never get to see the inside of a classroom. Most parents prefer to send a boy to school over a girl, because they believe the female will be married off. Some girls are married off by their relatives even at the age of 12 years. I am one of the few lucky girls who went to school.\r\n\r\nI completed my primary school education in the year 2007 and proceeded to high school in Turkana. My school fees for high school were paid by my local Catholic parish in Lodwar. I managed to attain a mean grade of B+ in my final high school examination. In my family and village, I am the only one who is educated to secondary school level and this motivates me to put more effort into my studies in order to uplift my family and community at large.\r\n\r\nI am happy to apply for this loan to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Strathmore University. Strathmore is my top choice because of its high quality education and facilities. Given this chance by Kiva, my higher education will be easily achieved. Thanks to God for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of challenges that I have faced, but normally I encourage myself by saying, \"What matters in life is not really where I am now, but rather the direction I am heading.\" I will never allow my past experiences to compromise the quality of my future. It is my dream to be a role model to many girls in Turkana County."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1089775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

They have four children, all of whom attend school.  Do\u00f1a Carmen, as she is commonly known by everyone in her community, has a grocery store that she started two years ago so that she could help her husband cover the household expenses.  At the moment, her store does not have a name.  She is requesting a loan to buy canned goods, bread, milk, eggs, fried snacks, and detergents.  \"More than ever, my store is lacking inventory,\" she says.  Do\u00f1a Carmen's greatest challenge is the lack of customers because there are few homes where her store is located.  However, she is hopeful that some day more people will settle here and that her earnings will increase.  Carmen also has problems with the high prices charged by her suppliers, so her profits are not at the level she would like.  During the time she has worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, Carmen started out working with a large group, but now she has completed two loan cycles by herself.  \"The loans have been a great benefit.  As a result, I have been able to restock my store.  Using the profits that were generated, my husband was able to buy a compressor for automobiles,\" says Carmen.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen and her husband Carlos have plans to open a car wash.  This will allow her to spend more time at home with the family so that she does not have to leave the house in order to earn a living.  Do\u00f1a Carmen comments, \"I believe Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad is very serious and committed to its clients.  I am extremely grateful to FRAC and to Kiva.  My family's quality of life has improved considerably and we hope to have a car wash business.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1084151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, and canned goods.

He is the light of her life and, most of all, he is the motivating force which propels her onwards each day. Her home is located in the city of Pisco, a city which is characterised by its warm climate and tourist attractions, such as the Ballesta Islands and the Candelabra Geoglyph. In her free time, Carina enjoys walking with her son and taking the opportunity to savour her favourite local food, the incredibly tasty \"Cau Cau\" (a stew made from beef, tripe and potatoes). She has completed her secondary school studies but she would have liked to continue to study Tourism and Hospitality.\r\n\r\nEach day Carina works with great enthusiasm at her market stall, which is a type of shop selling a diverse range of products such as gifts, personal hygiene products and wigs, among other items. She dedicates herself to her business for around 10 hours each day and she sees up to 30 clients on a daily basis. She believes that the reason her business is going well is because she is pleasant to her customers and she is located in a central spot.\r\n\r\nCarina is very grateful to the Kiva lenders as, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business such as wigs, beauty products and toys among other items, which will enable her to have more stock to offer to her customers and to improve her income. Consequently, she will be able to continue working towards realising her greatest dream: To provide her son with a good education and to study for a university degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1085953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She has had her business for approximately two years, starting with her first loan from Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing more clothes.

Likewise, her partner also supports her in this work.\r\n\r\nNow, Mar\u00eda is asking for a new loan from Edpyme Alternativa for an amount of 2000 nuevos soles that will be used for working capital (to buy vegetables) and to arrange her pens. This is because it is a very profitable activity in the area, and which in time will allow her to go on improving her standard of living with her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1086582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables to stock up her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T16:00:09Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eca Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":157.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":161.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":170.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":174.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":178.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":192.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":282.25,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":288.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423773},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":149.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":152.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317192},{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374011},{"amount":60.93,"local_amount":157.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":160.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385254},{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":161.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368848},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":170.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":174.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977894},{"amount":67.66,"local_amount":174.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":178.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115083},{"amount":69.2,"local_amount":178.6,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":182.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506759},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":185.95,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":190.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058712},{"amount":150.64,"local_amount":388.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":397.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804275}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T14:56:45Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":424106,"name":"Sophors","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophors is 36 years old, married, and has three children who attend school.

They live together in her relatives' house which is located in San Ram\u00f3n district, Chanchamayo.\r\n\r\nCamila is a brave woman with a strong character.  Her business is selling cosmetics, perfume and clothing through catalogs.  \"I have been in this business for almost three years and I can't complain.  It is profitable\", she says.  This business opened many doors to Camila because she had contact with people who, over time, became friends and offered to work with her in other potential businesses such as selling cell phones.  However, she says that her cosmetics business does much better.  She is now a sales promoter for several brands and receives gifts each time she gains customers.  One of her goals is to build her own home and provide her children with a little privacy.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Camila has requested a loan from MFP and she pledges to be responsible in making her monthly repayments.  She is a member of 'Las Triunfadoras' community bank and feels happy with her fellow group members because they are supportive and hard working people.\r\n\r\nCamila will use the money that she has requested to buy merchandise for the period leading up to Mothers Day.  This will allow her to fill orders that people have made with her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1086607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Camila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":88.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":90.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":106.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":113.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":119.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":125.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":159.08,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":167.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098800},{"amount":35.39,"local_amount":88.46,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":93.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401649},{"amount":36.13,"local_amount":90.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":95.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455931},{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":94.82,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451587},{"amount":0.26,"local_amount":0.64,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":0.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446767},{"amount":40.79,"local_amount":101.97,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052712},{"amount":88.05,"local_amount":220.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":232.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187817},{"amount":47.68,"local_amount":119.22,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571882},{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":125.34,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":132.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121656}],"funded_date":"2012-06-05T17:27:19Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":424114,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Corazon works hard to support her family.

She is 45 and a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines.  She is married to Danilo, a fish vendor, and a mother to her child.  Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nSylvia operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to residents of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by acquiring supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 50,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory.  She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSylvia hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells cooked viands for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She is 45 years old and a resident of Manila, Philippines.  She is married to Rosendo, her business partner, and a mother to her two children.  Together with her husband, she manages the household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMerlinda operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small quantities to residents of the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns money by acquiring supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 16,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerlinda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMargarita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is a place to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a living by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMargarita dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work from her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1091370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T18:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T18:20:16Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5964,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359354},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303169},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3313.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355893},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114027},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1325.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350119}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T04:58:09Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:18:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":422152,"name":"Daniela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Daniela es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora quien tiene una tienda de ropa usada.

She is married to Felipe, her business partner, and a mother of three children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZita operates a handicrafts business. What she basically does is buy raw materials used in handicrafts-making from suppliers, manufactures them into different products, and sells them per-piece for a profit. Products range from lanterns, lampshades, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are the local community.  She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw materials and supplies needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nZita dreams to expand her business and help her children finish their studies through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1091404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":" To pay for raw materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2827.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095743},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2826.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359356},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2827.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303171},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2120.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355895}],"funded_date":"2012-05-12T08:54:35Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":424173,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie is 45 years old and married with 2 children.\r\n\r\nTessie is in the agricultural business raising livestock in the Philippines.

She is 48 years old, married, and the mother of five children in her care.  She sells dyed fabric called \"thioub\", which she buys in the area, and incense known as \"thiouraye\".  She sells her products in an investment cycle no longer than two months.  Very experienced in this area, she knows her business well after having run it for more than ten years.  This new loan will allow her to buy a sufficient amount of fabric and incense to re-sell.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from her business, she plans to support her husband in paying for their children's education, and to put away a considerable sum for future investments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1091525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and incense to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diallo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1400,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":709157.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959308}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T08:15:44Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:45:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":422147,"name":"Unidad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Unidad lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ella es Rosa Argentina quien se dedica a la venta de chiver\u00edas y frutas desde hace 5 a\u00f1os en un colegio.

The members of the group decided upon this name because they are extremely devoted to the Virgin of Juquila.  For this reason, they selected this name.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe story being presented is that of Sra. Jazm\u00edn Gisela, who is the group representative.  She is 33 years old and married to Sr. Jorge who works as a merchant.  They have two children, Daniel and Armando, who are in the first and second grades.  Jazm\u00edn has been managing a grocery store for four years.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Jazm\u00edn decided to start this small business because she needed to improve her quality of life and that of her children.  She also wanted to help her children get ahead, but she did not have sufficient financial resources to provide them with a better education.  The loan she will receive will be invested in the purchase of more merchandise such as oil, milk, soft drinks, cookies, soups, sugar, beans, eggs, and other items.  Jazm\u00edn wants to continue investing in her business so that it can grow even more.  She plans to expand the facilities of her grocery store so that she can increase and improve her sales and her income.  In addition, she would like to continue supporting her children with their studies so that they can pursue a good profession and have a better quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nJazm\u00edn is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.

His community is considered one of subsistence living, as the majority of the residents are independent workers that breed and sell livestock, while others are involved in agriculture. Manuel lives in the district of Cayalti in the department of Lambayeque where his home has only basic electricity, water and plumbing. Over 850 families live in this area in similarly poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nManuel is well-known in his region because of his business of selling boxes of tuna.  He runs his small business from his home where he attends to his customers.  At the same time, his spouse also works from home by raising poultry in pens in the yard.  It is important to note that Manuel has over 4 years of experience in this activity as well, which has helped him to maintain his customer base and establish himself in his business.\r\n\r\nManuel has proposed to expand his inventory in both his business and in the breeding of small animals, because this is a very profitable activity in his region.  To accomplish this, he is seeking a loan of 2,000 Nuevos Soles which will be used to invest in merchandise (boxes of tuna), which in time will enable him to improve his family's standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1086794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-11T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-10T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":139.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":142.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":145.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":155.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":157.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":162.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":169.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":174.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":185.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":192.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":196.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Connelly","image":1230042}},{"id":422184,"name":"Chiltoma Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Chiltoma est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Mar\u00eda Elena quien vende derivados del ma\u00edz como nacatamales, tamales, yoitamal\u2026etc. El cr\u00e9dito lo invertir\u00e1 en ingredientes ma\u00edz, cerdo, especies, le\u00f1a\u2026etc.\nLas otras integrantes son Consuelo quien vende cerdo y almid\u00f3n e invertir\u00e1 en yuca, agua, aceite, mano de obra; y Veronica vende nacatamales, comida t\u00edpica a base de ma\u00edz y cerdo. \n","en":"The Chiltoma group is made up of three hardworking and entrepreneurial people.

He lives in a small village of Abasha District, West Georgia. He is married and lives with his wife, Maya. Two milk cows owned by the family are their source of the income. Part of the dairy products produced by the family is consumed by them and the surplus is sold on the local open market. Milk gathered from two milk cows isn\u2019t enough to use economy of scales in the business. Because of this the cost of production is too high and the profit is consequently low. Also the family has 100 nut trees in their yard and on season Kote sells harvested nuts. Total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. According to Credo's estimations the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKote requested credit for purchasing a milk cow. He plans to purchase an expensive breed of the cow, the milking capacity of which is double in comparison to the regular breeds. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Kote will purchase a milk cow, which will allow him to double the production and sales of his dairy products. With the same fixed costs and increased volume of production the costs of the product will decrease and the profit of the family will grow. Kote plans to reinvest the gained profit in the same business to expand it. In the long term the living conditions of the family will improve and in addition they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of

Mimoza produces cheese and sells it on the local open market, where she also sells nuts harvested from family-owned nut trees. Total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMimoza requested credit for the start-up of a small trade business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Mimoza will start a trade with second-hand clothes. She will purchase second hand clothes from wholesalers and sell them in her village. According to Mimoza\u2019s estimations, she will sell the whole stock in two weeks and reinvest the whole profit in the same business to increase the turnover. As a result of the new business initiative, the income of the family will increase and their living conditions will improve.

He lives in Tskaltubo District with his family; his wife, Sophio, a 3-year-old daughter and his parents. Shalva and his father lead the agricultural business of the family. They grow greens on a family owned plot of land and in a small greenhouse. Shalva sells harvested products in the Kutaisi (nearby town) open market. The family also owns a tractor, which is out of order and doesn\u2019t work. Shalva\u2019s mother has chronic health problems and receives a relevant pension from the government. Total average monthly income of the family is 250 lari. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nShalva requested credit for repairing the tractor. After it is fixed, Shalva will perform various agricultural services, including tilling the plots. He will get orders from neighborhood farms and will be paid for providing services. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. The tractor will become a new source of  income for the family. They will earn on average 200 lari per month. It will mean an 80% increase in the family\u2019s monthly income. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve and in addition to the above mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1091632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to pay for a tractor repairing service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kvitiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-05-12T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-11T05:00:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shalva","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":65.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358368},{"amount":35.16,"local_amount":56.26,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":57.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394563},{"amount":35.65,"local_amount":57.04,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":57.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449403},{"amount":36.74,"local_amount":58.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":59.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209609},{"amount":38.36,"local_amount":61.38,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440376},{"amount":450.96,"local_amount":721.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":733.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045438}],"funded_date":"2012-06-11T02:43:04Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":424314,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a 40-year-old married woman.

The members of the group decided upon this name because it includes the name of their community.  In addition, the group representative has three almond trees at home.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe story being presented is that of Sra. Aurora, the group representative.  She is 64 years old and married to Sr. Luis, who is a field laborer.  They have four children, but only her son Daniel is a student since he is in his first year of high school.  The other three children are already married.  She has been producing and selling utensils made of clay for more than 10 years.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurora says that she decided to start this business because she was looking for a way to help her husband with the household expenses and pay for their son's studies.  At the same time, she wanted to have an improved financial situation and an excellent quality of life.  With respect to her business, Aurora says that when she was a little girl, her mother taught her how to make utensils.  For this reason, she decided to start this venture.  The loan she is receiving will be invested in the purchase of more materials such as firewood and clay, as well as additional utensils so that she can continue her sales.   \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Aurora says that her goal as an entrepreneur is to make her business grow.  She wants to build a small shop since her greatest wish is to open a store where she can sell earthenware and make people in her community aware of what she does.  The loan will also help her to be well-stocked with a greater variety of products so that she can earn more income.  She would like to thank FRAC and the Kiva lenders for giving her this opportunity and trusting her.  Most of all, she is grateful that people believe in her.  With this assistance, she will be able to invest in her business and have a better quality of life and a better future along with her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe members who make up the group \"El Almendro de la Guadalupe\" are Adelina, Hernestina, Mar\u00eda, Guadalupe, Aurora, and Roc\u00edo.  They engage in businesses such as pottery making, making baked goods, and selling soft drinks.

Blanquillos del Charco.  The members selected this name because the community where they live is called El Charco. Several of the members sell fish and eggs.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Francisco because he is the group representative.  He is 40 years old, married to Rosalba, and has three children.  One is in the second year of high school, one is in the second year of middle school, and Adolfo is in fourth grade.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco has been buying and selling livestock for 15 years.  He decided to start this business activity because he wanted to look for the way to get his children ahead.  He also wanted to give them a better education, to give them a better quality of life, and to enjoy good financial solvency.  He will use the loan he was given to buy cows, calves, and corn.\r\n\r\nThe goals that Francisco has set are to make his business grow a lot more, to constantly invest in order to increase the number of animals he has, and to have better sales and production.
