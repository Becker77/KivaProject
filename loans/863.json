He lives in a substance-level community where the majority of residents are independent workers who work in commerce or raising small animals and some also work in agriculture. Giancarlo lives in the village of Pe\u00f1a Viva in the district of Tambogrande and the department of Piura. Here he has only basic electrical supply and they get their water from an artesian well. All the families from here live under these conditions. \r\nGiancarlo works raising and selling sheep, goats, and poultry. He raises his animals in corrals outside his house. It is noteworthy that Giancarlo has 2 years of experience in this work and, as a result, he has loyal customers. He sells his animals to the wholesalers in the area.\r\nCurrently, Giancarlo is proposing to grow his inventory, or, in other words, to raise and sell more animals.

He harvests his crops weekly and then sells them in the area's local market. He has been developing his farming activities for 15 years which has granted him experience. Likewise his spouse devotes herself to raising small animals (sheep and poultry) and supports him in his farming activities. Thus there are good family relations. \r\n\r\nCurrently Lazaro has determined to expand his inventory with respect to the sale of his harvested products, since it is a very profitable activity in the area.

is Rebecca, 58, resident of Taguig City, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother to her four children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRebecca maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 28,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRebecca dreams to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1092369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk- and meat-selling brings 150 AZN in income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan.

Milk products are considered as very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is only one financial income. Zergile applied for a loan of 1500 AZN to purchase one milk cow, one additional cow and five sheep.  This will be her third loan from AqroInvest, and Zergile has a good client history.

Meat-selling brings 200 AZN income per month. Beef and mutton are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Also, she sells sheep fur, which is useful for clothes and blankets.  \r\n \r\nThis is only one financial income. Merziya applied for 1,200 AZN to purchase two cows and two sheep.

Fresh fruits are also popular to have on the table and are used to make fresh punch. Her monthly income is 80 AZN, but raising crops takes a lot of strength and means lots of time spent working out of doors. That is why Purza relies on help from her son.

Cristina tells us that she has been a seamstress for many years.  Currently, she makes vests which she sells to companies.  She doesn't do the work alone since she counts on the help of her husband who also knows the business.  She doesn't have a fixed schedule because she increases or decreases her production according the orders (she receives).

She was widowed some years ago.  This was a great sorrow because her husband was her right hand, and, above all, she loved him very much.  She has a son who is an adult and is married.  However, he is always looking out for her, and he loves her very much. \r\n\r\nHer house is in a city that is known for having a warm climate year round.  There is a lot of agriculture in this city, especially cotton, asparagus, and paprika, among others.

She could only attend school until the fifth year of high school, but she would have liked to have continued with a university education.\r\n\r\nEsther devotes herself very enthusiastically to her work as a seamstress.  She mends garments and makes dresses and pants, among other garments.  She devotes around five hours a day to her business.  She is able to take care of up to ten customers a day.  She believes that it is going well for her in her business because she is well-known.  This is because she has been working for 20 years, and her place is located in a central area of the city.\r\n\r\nEsther is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.

Vive en La Man\u00e1. Para que conozcan un poquito esta hermosa cuidad les comentamos que el vocablo La Man\u00e1, proviene de \u201cLANG MANA ATTI\u201d, que significa mina del Gran Rey, por existir en el subsuelo abundancia de oro y otros minerales, teor\u00eda que se fortalece con el hallazgo de objetos arqueol\u00f3gicos en especial en el sector de Estero Hondo. Seg\u00fan el vocablo colorado MANA significa \u201cHERMOSO, GRANDE\u201d, que se atribuye a la fertilidad y a la generosidad de su suelo, ya que es apto para todo tipo de cultivo. \nRetomando a nuestra entrevistada Ubaldina nos cuenta que anteriormente trabajaba en una empresa en la cual al dejar de laborar le dieron liquidaci\u00f3n. Con ese dinero inicio sus cabinas telef\u00f3nicas ya que por su sector no hab\u00eda. Fue un gran acierto porque al ser lugar tur\u00edstico le va muy bien, su horario inicia a las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana y cierra a las 9 de la noche. Tambi\u00e9n vende tarjetas, recargas telef\u00f3nicas, snack, ropa, tiene mucho surtido y eso hace que tenga mucha clientela. Con el cr\u00e9dito piensa comprar m\u00e1s inventario e incluir a su venta sabanas, toallas y edredones. En un futuro desea adquirir una vitrina y copiadora para agrandar su negocio.","en":"Ubaldina is 46 years old, she is separated and has 3 adult children. She lives in La Man\u00e1. In order to know a little bit about this beautiful city, we will comment that the word La Man\u00e1 comes from \u201cLANG MANA ATTI,\u201d which means Mine of the Great King, because there exists an underground abundance of gold and other minerals, a theory which is strengthened by the discovery of archaeological objects, especially in the area of Estero Hondo. Accordingly, the colorful term \u201cMANA\u201d means \"beautiful, large\" and refers to the generosity of the ground as it is suitable for all types of crops.\r\n\r\nGoing back to our interviewee, Ubaldina tells us that previously she worked at a company but stopped working there as it went into liquidation. With that money she began her telephone booths since there were none in the area. It was a big hit because it is a tourist area and it is going very well. She begins at 7:00 in the morning and closes at 9:00 in the evening. She also sells telephone cards, telephone card recharges, snacks, clothing, and many supplies, and that means she has many clients. With the money from the loan she will buy more inventory including sheets to sell, towels and comforters. In the future she hopes to buy a display case and a copier in order to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1087463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use

their businesses. They are natives of a town called Patria Nueva where citizens are dedicated to cattle, agriculture and mining. Their dances are Chilean and they celebrate the festival of San Mart\u00edn on the 21st of January. This is an area rich in fauna and flora.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Sra. Josefa, 71, who is known for her friendliness. She is happily married to Sr. Isa\u00edas, a kind, hardworking man, who is a farmer.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Josefa has been selling clothing for five years, chickens for three years and perfumes and cosmetics for five years. She says she sells her perfumes in neighboring towns such as Nueva Esperanza, El Santo, El Guayabo and El Platanillo. She decided to start her businesses because she enjoys working and being an independent woman. One of her dreams is to grow her business.

indigenous people who want to improve their life conditions. The members of this group are natives of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca where machetes are made with etchings related to the culture of the region. Another of their handicrafts is the making of traditional clothing. The area is rich in fauna such as the prickly pear, \u201caguacatillo\u201d, \u201cpalmaguapinol\u201d, \u201ccaida\u201d and \u201c\u00e1mate\u201d. Most of the citizens speak the Mixtec language.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sra. Ana Luisa, 20, who is happily married to Sr. Fredi, with whom she has two daughters, Sonia and Analiz. Ana, as she is better known, has been selling footwear by catalog for four years. She has also been selling groceries for one month. She tells us that her store still does not have much merchandise because, as soon as she opened the business, the little merchandise she has she bought from the profits of her shoe sales. \r\n\r\nAna says that loans were how she began her shoe selling business. First she bought the catalogs, then she went door to door among her neighbors to offer her merchandise and then she bought the footwear to fill their orders. She realized that she was making a good profit and was selling so many shoes that she decided to buy extra pairs and sell them from her home but she still continued selling to her neighbors and in districts in her community. She is very happy because her earnings help her husband with household expenses and her daughters with their school expenses.\r\n\r\nAna says they bought a plot of land in installments so that they could provide an inheritance for their daughters because, with her husband\u2019s earnings they are paying off the land, and her earnings help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to purchase more grocery merchandise such as cookies, cereal, detergent, coffee, sugar, milk, vegetables, soft drinks, juices, candy, toilet paper, soap, cooking oil, beans and rice.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Felipa Nery, who sells dough and ground corn, Marbelia, who sells Mexican snacks, Juvenal Adauto, who sells household articles and Berenice Janeth, who also sells dough and ground corn. They thank the Fundaci\u00f3n for helping them improve their businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1084416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase groceries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-13T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-12T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa Nery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marbella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juvenal Adauto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana  Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Berenice Janeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7570.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8050.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8381.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8782.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9215.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":585.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":713.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":585.82,"local_amount":7570.59,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7607.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419009},{"amount":622.92,"local_amount":8050.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8088.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568585},{"amount":1189.67,"local_amount":15374.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15448.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399875},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":1789.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407569},{"amount":713.13,"local_amount":9215.77,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9260.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120135}],"funded_date":"2012-06-07T10:31:09Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":424744,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 29-year-old single mother of four children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.\r\nShe has been in healthcare services for twelve years working as a nurse.

Regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income, the country's rural poor lack access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Elene will purchase all the needed equipment to start a dentist's office for her son.

Markus plants vegetables such as tomatoes and basil. He learned the farming skills from his father. Every day he goes to the farm on foot. The farm is located approximately 500 meters from his house. His mother and brothers accompany and help him when working at the farm. He often harvests the vegetables every month and his mother sells them at a traditional market. The income from selling vegetables helps him meet his family needs. \r\n\r\nMarkus plans to plant more vegetables but he needs more money to buy more seedlings and fertilizer. This situation led him to request a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,000,000. Markus is hoping that he can improve the business as well as better meet his family's living costs.

She makes this kind of foodstuff herself. She distributes the products in a school canteen and kiosk near her residence. Sometimes the profit generated from the business is not sufficient in meeting her family's needs as well as the educational needs of Sonya and Lian. \r\n\r\nNaomi met with a TLM loan officer who offered a loan product. She then requested a loan of IDR 12,000,000 from TLM. She would like to spend the loan on Sonya\u2019s university costs and for purchasing more ingredients, i.e. wheat flour, frying oil, bananas, etc. for her business; also she would like to help her husband in enlarging his catfish business. She is expecting that the loan will bring more good impact for the business and family life.

Wangechi would like to use the loan to build a \"kibanda\" that would protect her business from this year's rainy season. She would also like to construct shelves to create more space for stock. Wangechi's goals for the future are to keep expanding this business and eventually to start a new one.

She lives in her own house together with her spouse.  It is noted that in the community where she lives, the community's quality of life is subsistence level, the majority are day laborers and some are independent business people who practice trade and raise domestic animals and some also involve themselves in agriculture. Mary lives in the neighborhood of Los Bances of the district of T\u00facume and department of Lambayeque, where there is only basic electrical service and the community water comes from an artesian well; here all the families around live under these same conditions.\r\n\r\nThe commercial activity practiced by Mary is the sales of traditional corn liquor (chicha de jora) and snacks, which she does from her home.  She is also involved in the growth and sales of pigs and poultry, and the raising of these animals happens in outdoor corrals on her land; it's worth emphasizing that Mary has 2 years of experience, which has allowed her to hold a steady customer base already established with her business.

They live in a rented house located in the district of San Ram\u00f3n - Chanchamayo. She sells clothes for a living, which she offers and sells house to house. She has been doing this for 3 years and considers it a profitable activity. \"Twice a month I travel to Lima (capital city) to purchase my merchandise\", she says. The products she sells the most are children clothes and polo shirts. Thanks to the direct contact with customers she has been able to span another type of business, which is the sale beauty products through catalogs, and she also does well in this activity; in addition to making a profit, she received awards because of the amount of sales she makes. She has been doing the latter activity for 7 months. One of her main problems is the lack of capital to purchase her products. \"That's why we are taking it slow, because I'd like to open a clothing store but there's no budget to do it\", she mentions as one of the goals she yearns for the most.

She lives with her family in a rented house located in the district of San Ram\u00f3n - Chanchamayo. She sells fruits and vegetables for a living. She has had this business for about half a year, thanks to the advice her parents gave her to get it up and running. \"I was a little wary, but it is profitable, it depends on the price at which I get the fruits at wholesale\", she says. Viviana is constantly traveling to the farmers' orchards to buy merchandise at a lower price. \"This is the season of citrus fruits and it is a good one\", she adds. She has a stand at the local market, but since she is doing well she is considering taking her merchandise to other cities, reason why she will have to invest more and contact other customers, this is one of her short-term goals.

He sells for cash and occasionally extends credit, but only to his most well-known and trustworthy customers.  His merchandise is purchased in Guayaquil every 15 days or on a monthly basis according to what he needs.  Jimmy already has 12 years of experience in this business and has done very well.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more merchandise such as trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.  His dream is to have a successful shop in a safe location.
