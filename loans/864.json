She is a personal image professional who offers her beauty services to women, men and children at the beauty salon where she lives.  She is an entrepreneur who started her own business 20 years ago because of the passion she feels for the work she does every day.  Her customers put themselves in her hands so they can walk out beautiful and relaxed, not only because of the quality service she offers but also because of her warmth as a person.  \r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to renovate her beauty shop to offer other beauty services, since her shop has enough space; and she also plans to hire a beautician.  Her greatest challenge is diversifying her product offer correctly with this new service, and having enough working capital to meet her expansion goals.  She is currently applying for a CrediKiva loan which is her first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  It will be used to buy beauty supplies such as hair color, straightener, shampoo, creams and colognes.  With the loan she will be able to increase her working capital somewhat and be able to buy more volume and obtain greater discounts from her suppliers.

She lives in the south of the city with her spouse and two children, aged 6 and 16. There she dedicates herself to improving the personal and professional image of her customers, because she is a beauty stylist, and she also sells a variety of merchandise. Her business began when she was a student, and she dedicated herself to commercial activity, selling Golfi gold jewelry and t-shirts to her fellow students, who paid her in installments. Upon finishing her technical degree as a beautician, since she did not find work, she added personal services to her sale of merchandise, offering haircuts, pedicures, manicures, etc., in customers' homes. Also, on weekends she sells cold drinks. Her goal for the future is to have a shop where she can set up her beauty salon as well as a display area for her products, including beverages and cosmetics, among other merchandise. Her greatest challenge is to have enough working capital to achieve her goal little by little. This is the reason for her application for a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

For the past seven years, she has used her home as a beauty salon where she uses beauty techniques to improve the personal and professional image of ladies, gentlemen, and children. Her idea for a business was born after she finished her State certification at SENA (National Service for Learning a Trade). That is how she decided to start her own business, using as seed capital a sum of money gifted to her by her spouse. Sibeliz's goal is to buy commercial premises where she would be able to attend to her customers in a more comfortable fashion. Her biggest challenge is to secure enough capital to attain smooth growth, and this why she asks for a Kiva loan. It is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the funds to buy more beauty products: hair products, shampoo, conditioner, lotions. Buying greater quantities of these products, which she uses daily in her line of work, will help her obtain a discount for buying in bulk. This is, along with her great experience in this trade and her willingness to make her business grow, why she is confident that her loan will be put to good use."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1088905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy more beauty products such as hair products, shampoo, conditioner, lotions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T09:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T09:40:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sibeliz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":32309},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":37340},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38211},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39103},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40015},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40949},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41905},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":42882},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43883},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44907},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45955},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52541}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.39,"local_amount":32309,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34021.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101148},{"amount":22.4,"local_amount":37340,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39319.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338761},{"amount":22.93,"local_amount":38211,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40236.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395317},{"amount":19.86,"local_amount":33107,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34861.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130323},{"amount":104.73,"local_amount":174558,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":183809.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497279},{"amount":110.69,"local_amount":184475,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":194252.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927914}],"funded_date":"2012-05-21T02:53:25Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":425374,"name":"Dominic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominic is a businessman who runs a grocery store.

","en":"Edgardo is 45 years old and lives with his spouse and his two children in the town of Soledad, where he makes washbasins out of granite in a space near his home. He sells them to neighbours, family members, and through referrals. They constitute they main customer base, but he also sells his products to a construction company of the area, which places orders in greater quantities than usual. Edgardo's goal is to make his business grow; he would like to hire people as well as to generate more capital to have at his disposal. This is his great challenge and what motivates him to ask for a Kiva loan, which is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Her elder son is employed and gets a low salary. Her other son Ra'fat has been a taxi driver for four years, which has been a profitable project, but also needs more support to cover costs.\n\nSameeha is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her son Ra'fat cover the costs of purchasing a new taxi. Taking out this loan will enable Sameeha to help her son get a new taxi, which will allow him to work extra hours and contribute to increasing the family's income.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the loan principal and the servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.\n

He trades in produce and fish, which he buys in the town of San Jacinto in the district of Bol\u00edvar, where he comes from. He sells them to shops, retailers and grocery stores of the area and he distributes them in a cart to neighbourhoods in the area. His goal is to make his business grow by buying whole harvests at a time, in order to become one of the major distributors in his district. The main challenges he faces are the seasonal nature of his trade and the fact that his working capital is not enough to meet growing demand. This is why he asks for a Kiva loan, which is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use the funds to buy avocadoes, pig meat, yam, fish, whey, cheese, and sapodilla plum. He is confident he will succeed because this investment will enable him to offer a wider range of products and thus be less dependent on the seasonal nature of his trade. He will have an important working capital and will be able to take advantage of harvesting time to buy for better prices and sell in greater quantities."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1088910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy avocadoes, pig meat, yam, fish, whey, cheese, and sapodilla plum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83721},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91897},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94041},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96236},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":98481},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100779},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103131},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105537},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":108000},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":118177}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":425541,"name":"Otgonbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otgonbat is a 31-year-old woman who lives with her husband and daughter in Uvurhangai province in Central Mongolia.

She started her business with a borrowed cooler and credit on a deposit and gradually strengthened it with nine loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo an organization with which she gave her business still more structure because she permanently increased her stock inventory and bought her own cooler.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge was when she started to extend credit in order to win over customers and she lost her money because some of them didn\u2019t pay her back which affected her liquidity.  But this experience was useful because it led her to be more careful with her management of credit accounts.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, her 10th FMSD loan, she will buy snacks, groceries, foodstuffs and beverages in larger amounts.  She will be successful with this investment because she will attain discounts for buying in volume and for paying cash and will thus be able to offer customers more competitive prices.\r\n\r\nWith help from FMSD she\u2019s managed to build up her credit history which is her best letter of introduction, to formalize her business in the city\u2019s Chamber of Commerce as well as attaining a good education for her children which makes her very happy.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1088989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy larger amounts of stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elcida Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81806},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84594},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86568},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88588},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90655},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92770},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94935},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97150},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99417},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101737},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104110},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":107670}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":425533,"name":"Soyolmaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soyolmaa is 49 and lives with her husband and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

","en":"Fulton, 56 years old,lives in the city center with his wife and their 3 children, aged 13 to 22. Here they have a business making sandals, and they also sell their customers merchandise that varies by season. They offer their most faithful customers small-scale financing.  \r\n\r\nInitially, Fulton was an iron monger, a skill he learned from family tradition. But the business began to deteriorate and he had to alter his activity and use this trade only occasionally, when a customer needed iron bars for doors or windows.  Now these bars are more a matter of decoration.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, his wife took a course through the 'National Learning Service' (SENA) and began making womens' sandals. Little by little, she gained a position among her neighbors and relatives to whom she was referred. Since she lacked sufficient working capital to respond to customer demand or to grow the business, she proposed to Fulton that he join her and invest his capital; she saw that this business would be more profitable than iron mongering. They began together the adventure of capturing the small merchant market in the cities of Barranquilla and, also, Cartagena, which today they have done. Things have gone very well and they have added a display location to their business, attended by their eldest son as administrator, while he pursues his professional studies in Business Administration. \r\n\r\nAt present, Fulton is requesting a Kiva loan, his 1st through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase, in greater volume, soles, capped heels, leather, and synthetic materials, as well as glue and paint, to give an elegant finish to the new designs they have prepared, especially for the celebration of Mothers Day. This is a season when families increase their purchases of these products, and this will be precisely the reason for the success of their Kiva loan, that plus the family's experience in this business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1088982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy, in larger volume, soles, capped heels, leather, and synthetic materials, as well as glue and paint for their sandal making business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T18:01:43Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T18:01:43Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fulton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":425578,"name":"Abbas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abbas is a 41-year-old Lebanese single man.

The idea for her business arose when she took a barber course at night at the age of 16 while working days because her teacher hired her when she saw her enthusiasm and ability to apply what she learned.  She acquired vast experience this way which in time she capitalized into her business like she has to this day.\r\n\r\nShe started out buying work tools with her own income and continued updating in beauty topics so was able to gradually expand her growth possibility buying furnishings to equip her salon. Her drive to make progress led to her opening an academy and she taught courses becoming well-known later on.  She then got a job that required her to travel frequently so she swapped her business for a good job but five years after that she returned to her original idea of having her own business.  She\u2019s done very well with this one and she also generates income selling merchandise, especially beauty-associated goods.

She will buy the necessary materials and supplies like concrete blocks, cement, sand, lumber, wire, gravel, purlines, metal sheeting, screws and solder, among others thus obtaining the infrastructure to give her family privacy, more comfort and a better standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1089081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to add a room to her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.26,"local_amount":1040.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286782793},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":1032.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1044,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294510166},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":882.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":892.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301834156},{"amount":43.69,"local_amount":1004.83,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308339310},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":778.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":787.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315308193},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":1012.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322916588},{"amount":87.97,"local_amount":2023.32,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339438596},{"amount":82.78,"local_amount":1903.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1925.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356436378},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1821.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364439158}],"funded_date":"2012-05-28T11:14:49Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T08:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":425827,"name":"Failautusi Eni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Failautusi Eni is 42 years old and married with one child.

Khazhu plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of farm animals. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1092513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase heifers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Pokrovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-05-14T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-13T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khazhu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1287.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-21T09:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":60409.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329832},{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30204.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459531},{"amount":643.75,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":30204.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743549}],"funded_date":"2012-06-11T15:06:00Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:31:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":425839,"name":"Faaaoao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faaaoao is a 40-year-old married woman with one kid.

Her house is hers and it\u2019s located in the Bellavista settlement in Tarma.\r\n\r\nRaising nine children is no easy task.  Most of them attend higher level schools in the city of Lima so every month she sends a certain amount of money for them.  Thanks to her various activities she\u2019s able to get sufficient capital to also invest in her crops and in her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a store selling groceries and basic staple items to local residents.  She also grows potatoes, peas, corn and vegetables on her own land located half an hour from her house.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this activity nearly 20 years and feels that she\u2019s successful selling to wholesale merchants in the market.  She also raises livestock like calves, cows and bulls that she sells to obtain extra money.  She gets the most use from her cattle because she uses them as tools to plow the land.\r\n\r\nHer objectives are centered on her children\u2019s education and she will work hard to continue helping them with whatever she can.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d communal bank and this would be her loan #7 with MFP.  She\u2019s very grateful for the support provided to date and this is why she commits to be punctual with her installment payments.\r\n\r\nCarmen will use the money she\u2019s requesting to buy three calves whose price varies between 400 and 500 soles that she plans to fatten up for subsequent sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1089137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571888}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T03:44:54Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":425851,"name":"Lealoaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lealoaina is 22 years old and single.

They live in their own house located in the village of Bellavista Huaracayo, Tarma.\r\n\r\nLuzmila\u2019s principal source of income is agriculture. She\u2019s been growing peas, beans, potatoes, maize and vegetables for about ten years. \u201cMy fields are far away; it takes me half an hour to get there,\u201d she says. However, with the determination that characterizes her, Luzmila leaves the house every morning quite contentedly to tend her land. Her husband and some labourers help her at harvest time. When this takes place, she transports the produce to the wholesale market to sell.\r\n\r\nNow she is preparing to sow peas. She is sure that the harvest will be profitable as it is a good time of year to sell the crops to buyers from Lima. \r\n\r\nLuzmila belongs to the Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay Community Bank, and this is her fifth loan with MFP.

He is the owner of a carpentry shop located in the city of Cartagena, where he lives with his wife and seven children who are between the ages of 25 and 51. He began learning his trade when he was 14 years old, from a carpenter who he helped at that time. From there, he took all of his experience, dreamed of having his own workshop, and kept working until he achieved that in 1989. From that moment on he dedicated himself to making and selling furniture. He is simultaneously employed by companies because they know the quality of his work. Cayetano's goal is to expand his carpentry service to include metal working, and to have a larger workshop. He is currently planning on his first \"credikiva,\" which will be the first financing that he has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to buy materials and supplies for furniture-making and he will also make some small adjustments to his workspace.

","en":"Alexander, 41 years of age, is a married man with three children between the ages of 8 and 13 years old. He lives in the city of Cartagena de Indias in the sustainable housing project administered by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. There he has made a living manufacturing doors and iron windows and grilles for twenty years. He worked for the Colombian Oil Company (Empresa Colombiana de Petr\u00f3leo) and when he didn't get contracts two years ago he devoted himself to his own business in order to settle his household expenses. With this things have gone well for him. His goal and great challenge is to have a strong business outside of his home as it's not comfortable for the family environment to have his business there.

He works around 10 hours a day and can have up to 42 customers in one day. He also has a video game business which is located in his home. He believes that things are going well with his business because he is responsible and above all because there's a great need for mobility in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOswaldo is very thankful for the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help, they will have enabled him to buy a television and a video game console for his business with which he will be able to offer a better service. Thus his earnings will improve and he will continue working to make his great dream- \"to have a bigger business\"- a reality.
