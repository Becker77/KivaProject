These purchases will improve the family's home living conditions and offer Huda's children comfortable beds to sleep in.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

His business is located in a slum area where there is a shortage of water and his primary customers are slum dwellers. He describes his biggest business challenge as a lack of better transportation to water facilities since he uses his own hands to carry water and distribute to customers. He will use the KES 20,000 loan to buy a new cart. Previously, Henry requested a loan of KES 20,000 from SMEP DTM which he managed to pay. He aspires to run a retail shop business within 5 years. He hopes that in the future, he will raise a happy family and will be able to meet their financial needs with ease.

This canton is known as \u201cthe Sultana of Coffee\u201d because the coffee that is cultivated there has a unique flavor.  The canton is also known for its cuisine and for the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nThe canton is also the home of Elena.  She is 40 years old, married, and has three children, ages 22, 19, and 15.  Her two oldest children are in university, while her youngest is in high school.  Elena\u2019s husband drives a public transport bus for a living.\r\n\r\nElena is a homemaker who also has her own income so she can help pay for her children\u2019s studies.  She earns money selling clothing from a catalogue, along with Esika products; these include beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories.  Elena sells her products going door to door and works three days a week, two to three hours per day.  She sells the items on credit and then collects payments every eight days.

She sells clothing in the communities in the area where she lives. She is very hardworking and enterprising. \r\n\r\nA few years ago Sandra decided to start a business selling clothing. Some days she also sells meat to her customers. She has lots of self-confidence and is always seeking new opportunities to supplement her husband\u2019s income which isn\u2019t sufficient to cover household costs. So she gets up early every day to do chores, take care of her family, and then begin her job in the communities nearest to where she lives. Many people prefer to shop with her as she is a friendly, responsible woman--but the most important thing is that they always find what they need at good prices.\r\n\r\nSandra\u2019s dream is to increase her inventory so that she is able make more sales and earn more money.

She lives in her parents\u2019 house located in Huasahuasi-Tarma.\r\n\r\nShe has nine years\u2019 experience in agriculture, plenty of time to give faith of her success because with profits obtained she covers her main costs (clothes, food and her child\u2019s schooling).  But what\u2019s most important for her is to make progress and to get ahead.  With help from her communal bank she was able to increase her potato crops and now she sells at wholesale in the city\u2019s central market.  This is how she obtains better profits from each harvest, the fruits of the constant chats and training they receive and of her own effort.\r\n\r\nShe proudly states: \u201cThrough agriculture I\u2019ve been able to save money. Now I have my own plots of land because I used to work my parents\u2019 fields.\u201d  Because of this, for later on, with savings she has, she\u2019s thinking of acquiring more farmland to increase production.\r\n\r\nThis would be MFP loan #2 so she mentions that she will make her monthly payments problem free.  She also says she\u2019s happy to belong to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Huanch\u00e1n\u201d communal bank because of the supportive, responsible work of her fellow members.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she\u2019s requesting to buy two bags of pea seeds (1200 soles).  She will use the remaining 800 soles to buy fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1089337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121662}],"funded_date":"2012-05-15T19:34:32Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":424274,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is taking out another loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to expand her existing business.

Her business is located near a Colombian professional football stadium, which is the home stadium of Junior, the team of the city of Barranquilla. She sells ordinary meals from 6 am to 3 pm. From Monday to Friday, her customers are mainly people from the neighbourhood, passersby and construction workers, who buy with ready cash or have a tab.

They know her by now and they frequent her establishment more and more. This growing demand in her market is proving to be to much for Denis's resources: she cannot match the needs of her customers and thus asks for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the funds to buy ingredients to prepare food, beverages and fresh drinks in order to be ready for the coming festivities, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Secretary's Day. With the loan, she will be able to buy more supplies, make larger stocks of the products that are the most in demand, and increase her working capital. This is what Denis needs to slowly see her dream of advancing in life come true, since she owns a house, a car and a small business with which to continue improving her life.

She is a retailer: she sells discounted products from catalogues or specialised guides and she also buys small articles and small house appliances that she sells on credit to a customer base that was built over the years and that is now growing. She started her business 13 years ago on the suggestion of her sister-in-law. Shirly started by selling perfumes, make-up and accessories from two catalogues, which were the fundation of her business. Gradually, she managed to work with discount sales that she organises every season, for instance this month on the occasion of Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Secretary's Day. Shirly also sells steel jewellery, of which she buys a new stock once a week. Her goal for the future is to buy a house of her own. She and her husband are very determined to attain this goal in order to give their daughters a better quality of life and help them become successful. Shirly is asking for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy discounted merchandise, particularly articles that sell very well this time of year: cosmetics, perfumes, plushies, small appliances, etc. She is confident that this investment will pay off because of her experience, of the orders placed by her customers and of the coming season, which usually sees an increase in her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1088948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Her house is located in the city of Imperial.  This is a city that is known for its mild and pleasant weather and also for its agriculture.  Betty is a tenacious woman, who most of all has always given 100% to provide for her children.  This has been a great accomplishment of hers, and  to do it she has always been very optimistic.  She put in a lot of effort to start up her business selling handicrafts.  Gradually, she started to get ahead, and later she added a business selling cakes and corn pudding.  Then, after saving up some money, she bought a food cart and started selling salchipollos (a dish with fried chicken and fried potatoes) and hamburgers.  At first, Betty was afraid to go out into the streets to sell her products, because she was a little shy.  But she gradually got used to it and lost this fear.  After that, when she started selling her hamburgers in the market in her city, it was a bit difficult for her because as she was selling outside, they would not allow her to be there.  But she eventually managed to rent a small spot in the market and kept improving her business.  She believes that her business is succeeding because she is very hardworking and because she treats her customers in a very friendly way.\r\n\r\nBetty is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help that they have provided her with, she will be able to buy handicrafts to sell for Mother's Day.  She will also purchase a rice cooker to cook her chicken and hamburgers.  This way she will improve her income and will be able to continue working toward realizing her biggest dream: to have her own restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1089355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is his story:\n\nI have been working in Tanzania with my wife for two years now, and we have been using our previous experiences to help in the development of education and business. We have left two grown-up children to their own careers in the UK. One of the first things that struck me was the limited use of solar power for a country with such a huge amount of sunshine. This was particularly noticeable coming from the UK! When we saw that people were using homemade kerosene lamps at night we felt there had to be an opportunity to make solar lights more widely available. A large part of my work for the Anglican Church was starting a wholesale business to import and distribute solar lights to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses who want to sell them in villages. Over 80% of Tanzanians have no access to mains electricity and they use dangerous, unhealthy and costly kerosene lamps as their main source of lighting, so there is a huge market for affordable, quality micro-solar kits. Watu na Nuru, which means \u201cLight for the People\u201d in Swahili, is the name of a growing collection of businesses established with the support of the Anglican Church of Tanzania, with the aim of making high-quality, affordable solar lighting kits available to rural communities.\n\nWatu na Nuru needs to have sufficient quantities of the right products at the best time of year (when farmers bring in their harvest). We need funds to ensure product is available when people are ready to buy it. When we are not selling product we provide training and technical support to retailers. We have developed a partnership with Barefoot Power Australia, who make what we believe are the best micro-solar systems on the market. My greatest challenge in this role is to get the right quantity of stock and spares to support the growing business. Your loan will support our stock so that more village entrepreneurs can sell these lighting solutions. My favourite part of this job is seeing a first order of product heading off for a distant part of the country to one of our small retailers just starting a new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":49525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49525,"image":{"id":1090033,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2586,"youtubeId":"RHd0RgEtvUY","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Martin from  Tanzania","thumbnailImageId":1090033},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy stock of micro-solar lighting kits from Barefoot Power.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dodoma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.183333 35.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":49525,"lender_count":1034,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":78000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":49525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":23400000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":54600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14857.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34667.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14857.5,"local_amount":23400000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-25T08:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":23400562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347014530},{"amount":7216.05,"local_amount":11365000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T08:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":11365273.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381633358},{"amount":10000,"local_amount":15749621,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15749999.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439646698},{"amount":17451.45,"local_amount":27485379,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T08:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":27486039.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467832451}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T02:13:19Z","paid_date":"2014-04-18T08:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":423550,"name":"Hebert Johnny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hebert es un hombre que  tiene  26 a\u00f1os de edad es de  estado civil soltero, y vive en la casa de sus padres junto con ellos, \u00e9l  domicilia en  el caser\u00edo Los Bances, distrito de  T\u00facume del departamento de Lambayeque; as\u00ed mismo se indica que este sector solo cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y el consumo de agua lo hacen a trav\u00e9s de norias artesanales, la mayor\u00eda de familias viven bajo estas condiciones.\n\nLa actividad comercial a la que se dedica Hebert  es la compra\/  venta de animales como ovejas, chivos, cerdos  patos, pavos, y cuenta con experiencia de  03  a\u00f1os.

With this, he plans to increase his total inventory and improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1089865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals, feed to fatten them, and to repair corrals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"T\u00facume - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hebert Johnny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":74.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":74.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":98.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.96,"local_amount":69.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":73.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332978},{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317214},{"amount":49.6,"local_amount":124,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374033},{"amount":64.76,"local_amount":161.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T09:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":171.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368869},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977912},{"amount":34.88,"local_amount":87.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":92.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115097},{"amount":36.02,"local_amount":90.05,"processed_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":95.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506773},{"amount":37.04,"local_amount":92.6,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":97.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058727},{"amount":38.54,"local_amount":96.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T08:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364512458},{"amount":39.46,"local_amount":98.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373128269}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T03:28:39Z","paid_date":"2013-06-21T09:01:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":426160,"name":"Shadrack","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shadrack is 30 years old.

Dejando un poco de lado el cultivo de caf\u00e9, una de las necesidades que \u00e9l tiene actualmente es reparar el acceso para entrar a su casa, pues se encuentra en mal estado y esto ocasiona que se golpee su autom\u00f3vil.","en":"Rogelio has worked with coffee plants since he was 15 years old.  His father taught him everything to do with the business, and once he turned 18 years old, Rogelio went out on his own to work his own lands.  Even though he has employees that help him carry out the daily activities, Rogelio himself works his plots of land.  Rogelio also works for the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d (Huatusco Regional Union) as a coffee taster.  He invests a lot of time in his coffee tasting, as he has to select the finest quality coffee for export.  During the last harvest, Rogelio had a total production of 9 tons of coffee.  He plans, in the course of 3 years, to have his farm producing a total of 12 tons of coffee.  He has the necessary expanse of land to make it possible.  Rogelio needs a loan to purchase fertilizers, which will allow him to meet the goal he has set for himself.  Leaving the coffee crop to one side, another of Rogelio's current needs is to repair the access to his house.  It's in bad conditions and is damaging his car.

Every morning she heads out to the settlement where the farmland is located where she\u2019s growing potatoes, corn, peas and greens.  \u201cThe work is tiring even more so when planting or harvest seasons arrive which is why my husband and I hire personnel,\u201d she affirms.\r\n\r\nOne of the inconveniences she has to deal with every planting season is the infestations that attack the fruit but Alina is persistent and intelligent and knows how to counteract these problems.  She has several parcels of land and when harvest time comes she has to invest much money to pay staff and that\u2019s why she plants each month.  For example, planting her spinach crop will be paid for by profits from cauliflower sales.  To do so, Alina has to work in a coordinated fashion with her husband.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d communal bank and this is her 4th loan with MFP.

She belongs to the \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay-Bellavista\u201d communal bank one of the oldest in her location and she feels happy to be part of such a solid group which is why she didn\u2019t hesitate to accept the post of president.\r\n\r\nWith the money she\u2019s asking for now she will be able to buy six bags of pea seeds to start the big planting season powerfully.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1089965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-15T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-14T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1450,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3829.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571897}],"funded_date":"2012-05-22T13:12:06Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":426113,"name":"Jeanne D`arc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne d`Arc is 51 years old and a widow with four children between 10 and 26 years old.

She lives in a West Georgian village, in Senaki District. Gulnazi is married and lives with her family: husband Seriozha, two sons, a daughter-in-law, two grandsons and mother-in-law. Gulnazi, Seriozha and their sons are involved in a family agricultural business. They have three milk cows and three milk buffaloes on their farm. Each evening, Gulnazi milks the cows and buffaloes. In the mornings, she makes traditional West Georgian cheese and sells, on average, 90 kg of this product per month on the Senaki open market. Along with the above-mentioned, the family has two hectares of land, where maize is grown. The family is busy with the farm all day, especially during the spring and summer seasons. The family's total average monthly income is 700 Laris, including the pension of Gulnazi\u2019s mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nGulnazi requested credit for renting a tractor for tilling the land.

Dreams and Goals ) 1 & 2 group. This group is comprised of ten women with small businesses who sell different products. Amanda is a single mother with three children. They live in the city of Santo Domingo. She has always worked hard to give her children what she was not able to have in her childhood. \r\n\r\nAmanda\u2019s business is a butcher shop. She sells different types of meat like chicken, pork, and beef. She has been working in this business for about five years. This is her 8th loan with Esperanza Internancional.
