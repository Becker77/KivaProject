She lives in her own home with her partner and she has three children under her care.  She mentions that the quality of life in the community is at the subsistence level.  Most of the inhabitants are independent workers dedicated to trade and breeding small animals.  Some of them also work in agriculture.  Maria lives in the village of Esperanza, district of Tambogrande, department of Piura.  The village has electricity services and water is consumed by means of an artesian well.  All of the families here live under these conditions.\r\n\r\nMaria is in the business of breeding and selling sheep and poultry.  The breeding of these animals takes place in corals outside of her home.  It is worth noting that Maria\u2019s six years of experience in this business has allowed her to keep her already existing customers.  She sells her animals to wholesalers in the area.  In addition, she owns 1.0 hectares of farm land where she has planted lemon trees.

This is the first time he\u2019s worked with IMPRO and with KIVA.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1090714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy tires for his minibus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":48,"posted_date":"2012-05-16T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-15T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.16,"local_amount":72.16,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":72.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287089911},{"amount":38.93,"local_amount":38.93,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":38.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294376888},{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":39.42,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":39.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301431471},{"amount":40.17,"local_amount":40.17,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308192066},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":41.13,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":41.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315423202},{"amount":39.04,"local_amount":39.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":39.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331164301},{"amount":88.68,"local_amount":88.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":88.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339546865},{"amount":44.16,"local_amount":44.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":44.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347096925},{"amount":45.19,"local_amount":45.19,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":45.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355842055},{"amount":51.12,"local_amount":51.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364550414}],"funded_date":"2012-06-01T22:03:43Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:02:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":426526,"name":"Lucita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucita is married with 3 children.

","en":"Dewis, 34, lives in the city of Cartagena.  He has a small cobbler shop run for all the members of his family, a business that he started so he could develop his free and entrepreneurial work spirit.  He arrived in Cartagena five years ago from Santa Ana Magdalena with a great desire to work.\r\n\r\nHe started his work life as an employee in a neighborhood store.  When he got together his money little by little to be independent and he had learned how to deal with customers, he decided to apply his knowledge of shoe repair to a business that would generate his own means of support.  He does this with great happiness, just as the photo shows.\r\n\r\nHe is located in an informal stall, a strategic place where he is well recognized by the residents of the area.  Not only does Dewis repair shoes for women, men, and children, very early in the day he also sells coffee and tobacco products on the terrace of a store.  For this he has 18 thermoses that he acquired little by little, the result of his work as a cobbler.\r\n\r\nHis long-term goal is to improve the conditions of his cobbler business and to grow with machinery and equipment.  He also will adapt his infrastructure so that when he organizes his family everything is ready to give them well-being and to be even happier.\r\n\r\nCurrently he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan he has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it he will buy work materials such as adhesive, molds, soles, etc.  He also will buy more thermoses and will make the most of this investment to have a new and elegant cart with which he will impress his market.\r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan will be successful because today it is a big challenge to get enough alternative working capital to invest.  With his Kiva loan he will respond to his rising growth, improve his service, better present the quality and security of his image, and cultivate new customers, converting them into devoted buyers of his products and services.  These are his main goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1090111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy adhesive, molds, soles, etc., as well as thermoses and a new cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-16T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-15T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dewis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76270},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80383},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82259},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84178},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86142},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90768}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.76,"local_amount":76270,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80769.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101166},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":80383,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":85125.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338779},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":82259,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":87112.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395332},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":84178,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89144.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775136},{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":174958,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185280.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387122},{"amount":1.18,"local_amount":1952,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2067.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993972}],"funded_date":"2012-05-17T03:43:46Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":423951,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"John tiene 35 a\u00f1os, es padre de una hermosa ni\u00f1a de nombre Katerin, de 11 a\u00f1os.

Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology at Strathmore University. This is his story:\r\n\r\nI am Victor, age 19, and I am an orphan from Laikipia, a rural and semi-arid district in Kenya. I succeeded in my final secondary school exams and was admitted to Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, for a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology. However, due to financial challenges in my family, I\u2019m unable to start university.\r\n \r\nUntil April this year, I have been teaching at a local primary school earning $38 US per month. Currently I am undertaking private studies to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with the hope that this will complement my university education. After paying for my basic needs and the CPA exams, the money I earned from teaching was not enough to allow me make any savings for my university education. My elder sister is in college pursuing a Business Administration course, and it has been difficult for our aging grandmother to pay her fees due to her dwindling income from farming.\r\n \r\nMy desire has been to pursue a degree course specifically at Strathmore University because of its reputation for offering high quality and competitive courses. Strathmore\u2019s top graduates are assured of getting jobs with well paying organizations within three months after graduation. At Strathmore University, I will work as hard as I did in high school to excel in my studies and in extracurricular activities. \r\n\r\nI selected my program because it prepares well for current and future career demands in areas of business and information technology. This will give me good prospects for either getting a job or being self employed offering consultancy services in diverse sectors of the economy. My goal for the future is not only to grow in my career, but to contribute to society by motivating and offering help to other needy students like me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":952.94,"image":{"id":1092620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

They have 2 children together aged 13 and 2 years, for whom he works very hard, above all because he loves them very much and wants them to be better than he is.  \r\n\r\nHis house is located in the district of Santiago, Ica, Peru.  The district of Santiago is characterized by development in agriculture, escpecially the cultivation of asparagus, grapes, cotton, and paprika, among other crops.  It contains many agro-export businesses which offer sources of work to the inhabitants of the zone.  When he has free time he likes to go for walks, and also enjoy one of his favorite dishes which is the delicious \"ceviche\".  He only attended secondary school, but would have liked to study electrical enginerring.\r\n\r\nDay by day Juan works at his business as a taxi driver, dedicating about 12 hours a day to the business. Especially on weekends, he often doen't go home for lunch because he uses these days to earn extra money.  He believes that he does well in his business because he has a great desire to do it well, and because he has a lot of charisma with his clients.\r\n\r\nJuan is very grateful to Kiva lenders because the help that they are providing him  will allow him to achieve some improvements in his house.  He will  install windows, lay a floor, decorate the walls,and finish builfding his garage.  This will allow his family to have more security, as the winter season is approaching and the cold will not enter his house as much.In this way will be able to continue fighting every day to realize his greatest dream:  to own his own piece of land for farming."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1090982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Para mejoramiento de vivienda (colocar ventanas, pisos, tarrajeo de paredes, entre otros).\r\nTo improve his house by installing windows, floors, wall treatments, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-17T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-16T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":211.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":215.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":224.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":235.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":242.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":253.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":261.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":271.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":285.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":293.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":305.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":426669,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James, 60, is married with five children and lives in Kasese,Uganda.

Four of them are still attending school with one of them studying in university; another one is in high school and the other two still in elementary school. She and her family were challenged at first in the new location, however, thanks to VisionFund Albania loans and their hard work, their living condition improved. \r\n\r\nDavide's business of over four years has included raising and selling piglets on the local market.

Her greatest challenge is having a sufficient amount of operating capital so that she can grow her business.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy thread in bulk, repair her sewing machine, and purchase supplies for strengthening her manicure and pedicure business.

Because transportation is a big problem for this family, Teang is requesting a loan for $1,300 to buy a motorbike to use when commuting. This will allow her to save the money she and her family currently spend on transportation, and use it instead to improve the family's living conditions.

Their salaries do not usually suffice for the family's necessities. \r\n\r\nRecently she bought a small plot of land in the boundary area of Kherlen. Her family is planning to build a ger and fence it in. A ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt and it is comfortable to live in for small families. But it is quite cold in winter without the additional cover which is the same as wall insulation, and it costs a lot of money for the smoky coal which is used to warm the ger inside. Using the additional ger cover cuts the smoky coal usage notably and it contributes to reducing air pollution in the city. Air pollution and air quality is one of biggest issues in most Mongolian households and big cities. Mrs. Narantuya believes that her plan is environmentally friendly. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buy the new ger cover and building materials to build the fence around her plot of land.

She is single and manages her own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. Dwighta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also retails mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Dwighta hopes to be able to expand soon. \r\n\r\nDwighta faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

From this marriage, she has three children, two adults and one 11-year-old who is in school. Two of their children still live at home. Elba's husband is a shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nTo be able to help her husband with household expenses and take advantage of her culinary talents, Elba opened a restaurant in her house. There, she prepares delicious dishes that are the delight of her customers. She works every day and prepares breakfasts and lunches. She doesn't serve dinners because, she says, she gets very tired given that she gets up at 5 a.m. to prepare the meals. Plus, she works alone, so she takes the afternoons off. She has had her business for three years, and it's going very well.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to purchase rice, meat, fish, and other ingredients for the preparation of the meals. She has been in the Communal Bank for three years and she likes it because the first loan helped her set up her restaurant.\r\n \r\nHer dream is to improve her restaurant.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1090196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, meat, fish, and other provisions.

She earns a living through planting rice as her primary business. She has been in this business for almost thirty-three years now. As a rural farmer, she has challenged with the lack of working capital for her business. \r\n\r\nNhoem's group consists of two members who are all female. She and her group member have been with Kiva's field partner, VisionFund, for six loan cycles and they successfully paid back the loans with VisionFund. The past loans have helped her make her living better. Currently, she can earn her daily income of up to 19,000 Cambodian Riel and manage to save around KHR9,000 per day. She is leading her group to apply for a loan. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland.
