She earns a living through planting rice as her primary business. She has been in this business for almost thirty-three years now. As a rural farmer, she has challenged with the lack of working capital for her business. \r\n\r\nNhoem's group consists of two members who are all female. She and her group member have been with Kiva's field partner, VisionFund, for six loan cycles and they successfully paid back the loans with VisionFund. The past loans have helped her make her living better. Currently, she can earn her daily income of up to 19,000 Cambodian Riel and manage to save around KHR9,000 per day. She is leading her group to apply for a loan. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland.

She is a hard-working, 36-year-old mother of 5 dependent children. Of the children, only 2 go to school, as the family doesn\u2019t have enough money for all of them to attend school. This family of very modest means, works in agriculture. They have a small farm where they grow plantain; the challenges they face include having to sell their product to middlemen at a lower price, because they themselves don\u2019t have the possibility to transport their product to other areas where they could sell for a fair price. She has received 4 loans and each was invested in the production of plantain, allowing her to buy supplies for the caretaking of the crop, and that way, continue production. The whole family works on the farm as it\u2019s their only source of income.\r\nTogether with Elvira, there are 6 more members who will be investing in agricultural or commercial activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1091338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

The main challenge for the family business is the lack of working capital to run the business well. \r\n\r\nReth's group consists of two female members. She has been with Kiva partner VisionFund Cambodia (VFC) for three loan cycles while the other group member has been with VFC for one cycle. Reth successfully paid back the previous loans, which helped her family run their business well. Reth, who is the leader of the group, will use her portion of this new loan to buy construction materials for the family house building business. She hopes to increase the business activity and earn more income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1097231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction materials for the family house building business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-05-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-16T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sareang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":300750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118477},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":501250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046182}],"funded_date":"2012-05-18T00:55:52Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:47:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katherine Gifford","image":null}},{"id":426993,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne is married with two children.

His wife, aside from running the business with her husband, also cares for their son and tends to the house. \r\n\r\nRen\u00e9 has a store where he sells basic supplies such as sugar, salt, corn, milk, pastries, and candy, among many other items. He also has a business selling pies, hamburgers and tacos made of pork, chicken or a variety of fillings, which are deliciously prepared by his wife. The couple runs both businesses from their home and shares a common desire: to provide a better future for their son, who will soon be taking his first steps as a student.\r\n\r\nAs they have invested in setting up their meat pie selling business in recent days, they have had to stop stocking their general store with products their customers request every day. Consequently Ren\u00e9, like a good administrator, has decided to apply to INTEGRAL for a loan so that he can buy dairy goods, meat, sausages, sodas, eggs, medicine, Pampers and other perishables their customers request. He hopes he can rely on this funding and thus not lose his customers, which have taken so many years to attract, because they cannot find the variety of products they need. In this way, Ren\u00e9 hopes to continue providing his family with their daily bread and carrying out his duties as a responsible father.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1091367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase dairy products, meat, sausages, sodas, eggs, medicine, Pampers and other perishable articles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-17T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-16T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rene Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.01,"local_amount":106.01,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":106.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049664},{"amount":59.1,"local_amount":59.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":59.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521301},{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":61.06,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":61.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329920},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":93.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":93.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321102},{"amount":82.75,"local_amount":82.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":82.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929678},{"amount":98.24,"local_amount":98.24,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":98.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331924838},{"amount":71.99,"local_amount":71.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339845979},{"amount":78.64,"local_amount":78.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":78.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347003900},{"amount":149.06,"local_amount":149.06,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":149.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450531}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T20:43:23Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":427112,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti is a single mother of seven children, five of whom are in school.

e infantil; sus principales productos son blusas, pantalones, y vestidos. Esta actividad la inici\u00f3 desde sus 18 a\u00f1os, cuando aprendi\u00f3 por tradici\u00f3n, pues su madre tambi\u00e9n se dedic\u00f3 a ella y Odilia creci\u00f3 ayud\u00e1ndola. Sus deseos de superaci\u00f3n la llevaron a estudiar en el Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje \u201cSENA\u201d y terminar la carrera de Direcci\u00f3n Comercial; para poner en pr\u00e1ctica lo aprendido  con su prima dio apertura un taller de confecciones  en casa de su t\u00eda, con ello afianz\u00f3 sus conocimientos y adquiri\u00f3 mucha mas experiencia y una gran clientela,  hasta el punto que debi\u00f3 mudarse para ubicarse mas c\u00f3moda y estrat\u00e9gicamente.   Durante dos a\u00f1os trabaj\u00f3 con su prima en este taller, pero finalmente ella emprendi\u00f3 su viaje a otra ciudad y Odilia debi\u00f3 nuevamente re direccionar su propuesta sola,  como lo hizo durante 5 a\u00f1os en los que su microempresa creci\u00f3, se tecnific\u00f3 y se perfeccion\u00f3. Al organizar su familia y con el nacimiento de su hija, se concentr\u00f3 en ella durante 5 a\u00f1os y cuando estuvo todo listo para trabajar nuevamente, retom\u00f3 su arte, trabajando en diversos talleres como empleada, all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 la confecci\u00f3n de ropa de fiestas, vestidos de bodas y en general de alta costura. As\u00ed fue como al estar  preparada para emprender su propia aventura de negocios, su cu\u00f1ada fue quien la ayud\u00f3, pues a su nombre obtuvo el cr\u00e9dito de las primeras maquinarias y con ello el ejercicio de lograr clientes sostenibles, para poder pagar esta adquisici\u00f3n, con sus utilidades como efectivamente lo hizo. En la actualidad su estructura est\u00e1 conformada por 2 m\u00e1quinas planas, 1 fileteadora 1 maquina familiar, tiene aproximadamente 150 clientes y vende a cr\u00e9dito y de contado; ella para realizar la transacci\u00f3n pide un anticipo del 50% y el saldo, una vez entrega la prenda. Sus compras las realiza de contado en almacenes cercanos. As\u00ed mismo como vive con su hija de 15 a\u00f1os, esta la ayuda mucho en el negocio, porque tiene una fuente de creatividad inagotable,  que Odilia aprovecha,  pues es genial en el dise\u00f1o de las prendas, oficio que le apasiona. De su hija Odilia se siente muy orgullosa y todos los d\u00edas trabaja, para ofrecerle muchas oportunidades de que sea exitosa, en lo que a ella le guste, que es precisamente  la l\u00ednea de dise\u00f1os. Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario santo Domingo, mediante l cual comprar\u00e1 una m\u00e1quina industrial recubridora, para dar un mejor acabado a la prenda, una plancha a vapor y rollos de telas para elaborar vestidos femeninos y tener un stock que mostrar para el d\u00eda de las madres, una de las temporadas de mas movimiento comercial, en la que usualmente se incrementan las utilidades de Odilia, que la ayudan al cumplimento de sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Odilia, 51, makes clothes for women, men and children.  Her main products are blouses, pants and dresses.  She started this work at the age of 18 when she learned it by tradition because her mother was also in this occupation and Odilia grew up helping her.  Her desire for self-improvement led her to study at SENA, the National Learning Service and to complete a course in Commercial Direction.  To put everything she\u2019d learned into practice, she opened her first sewing shop with her cousin at her aunt\u2019s house and strengthened her skills there and gained much experience and a good clientele to such an extent that she was able to relocate to a more comfortable, strategic place.  \r\n\r\nShe worked in this shop with her cousin for two years but eventually moved to a different city and Odilia started anew to run her business by herself.  She did this for five years and her micro business grew, she became more technologically adept and she perfected her skills.\r\n\r\nWhen she formed her own family and had her daughter, she concentrated on her for the next five years and when she was ready to return to work again she retook her art working in various workshops as an employee.  There she learned how to make party dresses, wedding gowns and haute couture in general. This was how when she was ready again to start a business of her own, her sister-in-law helped her because she took out a loan in her name to buy her first machines and with that she was able to acquire regular customers to be able to pay for this purchase and with profits is exactly what she did.\r\n\r\nHer shop currently has two plain machines, one overlock machine and one family machine.  She has approximately 150 customers and she sells on credit and for cash.  To accept a contract she asks for a 50% down payment and the remainder is paid upon delivery.  She pays cash for her supplies in nearby stores.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her 15 year old daughter who helps her very much in the business because her creativity is bottomless and Odilia takes advantage of it because she is genius when it comes to clothing design, something that she\u2019s passionate about.  Odilia is very proud of her daughter and she works every day to provide her with more opportunities to be successful at whatever she likes which is precisely designing the clothing line.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy an industrial blind stitch machine to better finish the articles of clothing, a steam iron and bolts of fabric to make women\u2019s dresses and have stock available to display for Mother\u2019s Day, one of the seasons of highest commercial movement when Odilia\u2019s profits usually increase helping her to reach her

Her son goes to school. Temur works as a night watchman at a local private company. Elene leads the family's agricultural business. They have a small vineyard, and Temur sells grapes in the village. The family's total average monthly income is 200 Georgian laris (GEL). According to Credo estimates, the family falls in the subsistence-poor category.\r\n\r\nElene requested credit to start up a new agricultural business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing credit to start-ups and re-startups with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. Elene will use her loan to purchase and raise 15-17 calves, who will be placed in an old cattle shed in her yard. After half a year, she will sell the grown calves for a higher price and get the profit. For the first 2 cycles of her new business, Elene will reinvest most of the profit to increase her turnover. This will enable the family to increase their income and thereby combat poverty. In addition, in the future, the family will have enough income to access the regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market in case of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1097595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Napareuli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":580}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358390},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394585},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449423},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209629},{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440396},{"amount":1980,"local_amount":1980,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045458}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T22:11:43Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Supryia Ray","image":null}},{"id":427184,"name":"Malan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malan is a 24-year-old single man in the business of selling spare car parts.

So she gradually started up and was able to get connected with two organizations that sell products providing a specialized guide. Her main product lines are cosmetics and costume jewelry in general. Since Violy is an enterprising woman she knows business opportunities well when they present themselves, and takes advantage of them. Therefore she also sells drinks and refreshments in general to her neighbors and passerbys who visit her. \r\n\r\nHer goal down the road is to buy her home and expand her client base. Her great challenge for this latter goal is having sufficient working capital to achieve it. Thus she turns to her Kiva loan, her first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domestico. With it she will purchase toiletries and personal grooming products, cosmetics, colognes and other merchandise, given that Mothers' Day is coming up, a time in which businesses get a breath of fresh air if they have enough inventory to be able to impact their clients. So that's what she plans on doing with her Kiva loan: increase her sales and inject that additional working capital. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1091866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase toiletries and personal grooming products, cosmetics, colognes and other merchandise. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T11:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T11:00:07Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162701},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181439},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":185672},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":190005},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":194438},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":215745}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.59,"local_amount":162701,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":165652.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101174},{"amount":104.37,"local_amount":181439,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":184730.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338787},{"amount":106.8,"local_amount":185672,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":189040.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395339},{"amount":109.29,"local_amount":190005,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":193452,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775142},{"amount":111.85,"local_amount":194438,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":197965.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387128},{"amount":124.1,"local_amount":215745,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":219658.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993978}],"funded_date":"2012-05-29T16:35:39Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":426532,"name":"El Chadai Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe EL CHADAI est form\u00e9 de trois personnes qui sont des amies.

","en":"Zaida is 59 years old, and makes a living as a seamstress. She began working in the trade as soon as she completed her primary education at age 17, and her first job was operating machines in a sewing workshop. After a few years, she decided to create her own business and become more independent, since she had to take care of her father. When her children were born, she worked even harder to make her business successful so that she could provide for them. She primarily sews clothing and undergarments for women, though she does make other products. She serves a customer base located mostly in her region, and she is well known for her designing talent. \r\n\r\nShe conducts her sales on credit, and also offers services to clients where they can pay cash up front. The biggest challenge she currently faces to steady business growth is the fact that she lacks the necessary capital to invest in infrastructural improvements. With her challenges and goals in mind, she is requesting this loan, which will be her first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and Kiva.

She lives in her own house with her two small children, Dar\u00edo (7 years old) and Aldair (3 years old). For her, her children are the most important thing in her life. \r\n\r\nThe activity which she carries out is the sale of soft drinks from a stall which she set up in her home. She has been working in this way for 5 years and she says that the most difficult days are during periods of rain when people don't often come to her stall. This work is worthwhile as she always has an income which helps her with her needs and her children's education.

His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Nugzar will purchase a better car and will restart the business. He will purchase fruits and vegetables from farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns.

Su capacidad de trabajo, actitud de crecimiento y su experiencia, convertir\u00e1n esta inversi\u00f3n en exitosa, para el buen desempe\u00f1o del negocio de Maria y esto es lo que justamente hace Kiva con sus financiaciones.","en":"Mar\u00eda is a woman who defines herself as Christian-Catholic, home-loving and a merchant by birth.  She\u2019s from Santander Department but considers herself to be an adopted daughter of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her two children who are 30 and 34 years old and she is involved in commercial activities like selling varied merchandise via catalogue.  The main kinds of merchandise se sells are women\u2019s clothing and underwear as well as accessories for women and for the home.\r\n\r\nBecause Mar\u00eda is an enterprising, restless woman \u2013 characteristics she gets from the culture of Santander- she also sells dairy products like yoghurt by the liter, mozzarella cheese and coastal whey among her customers.  She has noticed that her clientele is growing every day so her hopes of growth grow too and her working capital turns out to be insufficient to attain them.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason for turning to a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo by means of which she will buy mainly women\u2019s underwear and clothes for Mother\u2019s Day to take advantage of the celebrations that take place in families on account of this day, a season when her sales and her income increase.\r\n\r\nShe also needs to buy dairy products in larger amounts because she can only get these items paying cash for them and Mar\u00eda must have cash available to pay her invoices that are about to come due and getting her accounts receivable pain in due time is sometimes slower than she\u2019d like.\r\n\r\nHer capacity for work, her growth attitude and her experience will make this investment successful for the good development of Mar\u00eda\u2019s business which is precisely what Kiva intends with its loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1090101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She has told us she has always had to work, first to help her husband paying for their family expenses, and then nowadays, as she has to provide for their family since her husband is now disabled. Adela has told us that she started selling pig meat and meat with chili to her friends and to the neighbors of her community; however, she had always wanted to run a small grocery store, and thanks to her job, one year ago she had a small locale built next to her house where she opened her grocery store. She says that she likes keeping her store always stocked up so that her customers can always find what they are looking for. Even though she already has her own grocery store, she keeps on selling meat, and her husband helps her running the shop.\r\nShe will invest her loan in the purchase of cooking oil, canned food, beans, rice, soft drinks, sweets, chips, sweet bread, biscuits, salt, sugar and mayonnaise, in order to stock up her shop.\r\nShe hopes that this loan will help her activity grow, as she wishes to have a better standard of living; she will invest her earnings in stocking up her shop.\r\nThis group is thankful for the support and the trust shown in granting this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6050,"image":{"id":1084373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Her main challenge is working capital which is insufficient to meet her goals.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason for calling on her Kiva loan, the first financing she gets from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy t-shirts in larger amounts; she will also invest in merchandise appropriate for Mother\u2019s Day gifts since it\u2019s approaching and sales as well as income generally increase with it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1092069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy t-shirts in larger amounts and also to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eimy Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74501},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82229},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84147},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86111},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88120},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90176},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92280},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94433},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96637},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98892},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101199},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":74501,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":74924.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338792},{"amount":94.53,"local_amount":166376,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":167321.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395345},{"amount":488.14,"local_amount":859123,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":864004.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497298}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T22:22:07Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":424547,"name":"Flor Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

","en":"Iris, 48 years old, lives with her partner and her two children, aged 17 and 22, in a neighborhood south of the city, where she has a business selling cold drinks and fried food. She also sells merchandise through specialized catalogues. Her business experience dates back 16 years, when she started selling beer, ice, and corn chicha (a fermented drink) with a small amount of capital her partner gave her. Later, with her own earnings, she acquired a fryer and bought more bottles, and also began to sell very cold and pleasant drinks, adjusted to Colombia's hot Caribbean climate. Gradually she has made very good use of her captive customer base in order to diversify what she offers and thus be able to offer her customers credit for the items they need, especially cosmetics. Currently she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

the leader of the \"Aynuska\" group.  She is 62 years old and a widow.  Sharikan is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business in 1990 with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).

married and raised five children.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business selling food products at a market in 2005.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Manzuura was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 30,000 som (KGS).

According to Credo\u2019s estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMichael requested credit for building a greenhouse. He already has metal construction for the greenhouse. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Michael will purchase a polyethylene cover and construct the greenhouse. Also, a small part of the credit will be used for purchasing fertilizers. Michael will grow cucumbers and tomatoes during the summer and fall months and greens during winter and spring. He will sell harvested products at the Kutaisi market. The income of the family will significantly increase and Michael will be able to create better living conditions for his wife and mother. Along with the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of

She has been doing this for one year with the help of her husband.  She spends the majority of her time in her store and taking care of her small children.  Thus, she needs to hire help someone to help her in the fields.  She says that the her business has recently begun to stabilize and allow her to sustain her family, but she is confident that with the support of these loans and her effort she will be able to achieve a better quality of life for her children.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Ruth is seeking from MFP.

She used some money she had to start the business. She plans to use this loan to buy more gallons of gasoline. She will reinvest the profits in her business so she can expand her sales and supply more clients. This is her 10th loan with Esperanza International, and she is very excited about it. She has been investing all her loans in her business, which has made it possible to respond to the need for gasoline in her community.

","en":"Joaqu\u00edn is 44 years old and lives with Sandra, whom he has been with for a little while. They want to have children, but they want to acquire some comforts for their home first before welcoming new members of the family. They live in a house they built in the native community of Chanchamayo, Peru. Joaqu\u00edn has lived in the area for 23 years, and since then has made a living growing citrus fruit, coffee and annatto distinctly distributed over eight plots of land. \"It suits me to plant more coffee and annatto. It's harvested once a year, but it sells immediately,\" he says. Currently he is harvesting oranges and mandarins, which he sells within his community since the buyers already know the quality of his fruit and visit him to acquire the products. With the support of hired day laborers he can cover the eight areas of crops he has. The work is far from easy, so Sandra does her part by bringing food and cold drinks, and when the meals are finished she picks up field-working tools to help out. Joaqu\u00edn's plans for the near future are to increase his coffee and annatto production by buying new seedlings to put in the empty spaces and also changing out the coffee plants that aren't producing for new ones. This is his eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP. He belongs to the \"Las Rositas de Ubiriki\" community bank, where he feels satisfied with the work carried out over all these loan cycles as a responsible member. With the money he is requesting, he plans to hire day laborers to clean his crops and use the rest to purchase sacks of fertilizer for his citrus and coffee plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1092229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers and purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-19T01:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-18T01:00:11Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joaqu\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2050.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121676}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T00:53:14Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":427559,"name":"Restituta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Restituta is a married woman from Trinidad, Bohol.
