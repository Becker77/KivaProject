Despite her age, Victoria has worked in the fields with the same vigor for the past 20 years, dedicating herself to agriculture. She is a native of the city of Huancayo and came to the central jungle to start a family, and since that time she learned how to grow citrus fruits, yucca and pineapple. She has a parcel of citrus fruit and seven of pineapple. \"Growing pineapple suits me. The price is good and so is the demand, although its in season for only two months.

His son works as a policeman and his daughter is a nurse in a local hospital. Alex runs the dairy farm owned by the family. He takes care of two milk cows and produces on average 40 kg of cheese per month, which is sold from the family home to local dairy product retailers. The total average monthly income of the family is 1000 laris. \r\n\r\nAlex has requested a loan for purchasing calves.

She undertook this business through her husband\u2019s initiative. He worked at running a store.  \r\n\r\nThis experience paved their way to develop their own business adventure.

She makes her sales for cash, and her main customers are housewives who buy retail stapes they need for their households.  \r\n\r\nHer goals for the growth of her business are faced with the challenge of not having enough working capital to expand her business.  That is the reason she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy a display case and varied merchandise to stock it.  She will do this because May is one of the times that her sales increase.  The increase is due to the family festivities and religious holidays that the families celebrate.  These festivities and holidays generate a good volume of customers, and that is exactly what increases her income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1092776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a display case and varied merchandise to stock it.

Since then, Phyllis has been in photography for 15 years. \u201cI decided to take that hobby and turn it into a career,\u201d she says. Phyllis, age 45, with a Bachelor in Marketing, returned to school to complete her degree in Computers and Graphic Design. While in college, Phyllis obtained two internships: one in marketing and another working on computers. The marketing internship was not for her. \u201cI would get off work and take time to photograph,\u201d she says. Soon after, Phyllis received compliments. \u201cMaybe someone is willing to pay me for this,\u201d she thought. \u201cI\u2019m going to slowly build the program.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn January, Phyllis opened \"PJE Multimedia\" in Shreveport. Phyllis plans to assist other local businesses with creating and assembling their websites. Another aspect of Phyllis\u2019 work is her ability to manipulate a photo to please clients. For example, she photographed an elementary class and, for one parent, Phyllis swapped her child, who was standing on the end, with the child who was standing front and center. However, Phyllis says she wants to focus more on web design and graphics until she can fully develop her photography business plan. When she photographs, Phyllis tries to capture the essence of her subject. \u201cThe purpose is to portray the photos as art,\u201d she says. Phyllis advises her customers: \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind, and if I can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter attending a lecture on small business administration at Louisiana State University, Phyllis inquired about a loan from ACCION Texas Inc. instead of a traditional bank. Recently approved, she will use the loan to purchase a lighting kit which includes lights, a green screen background and a small black background for torso and head shots. The loan will also fund product research. Phyllis plans to work with another company to print her photos on shirts but she needs to know the shirts won\u2019t wither after a couple of washes. \u201cIf a company is not up to par, I\u2019ll switch companies,\u201d she says. At the moment, Phyllis does not employ anyone else but she plans to contract a model to be on-call and pose in the shirts with her photos on them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I have to make a quarter,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to make a picture and approach a client \u2026. The money is nice, but the emotional reaction from clients is better.\u201d For more information about PJE Multimedia, visit her website at: <a

women\u2019s clothing store, on April 28. The shop is located on a main street, 30 blocks outside downtown Laredo, Texas. At <i>It\u2019s New to Me<\/i>, Mirella sells dresses, jewelry, purses, some shoes, candles and other accessories. Though she currently sells women\u2019s apparel, Mirella plans to expand and sell new and gently-used furniture. She also plans to open a small snack shop within her store to enhance the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nMirella wanted to be her own boss, which influenced her to become an entrepreneur. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for someone else all my life,\u201d she says. Her cousin owns a furniture resale shop in Corpus Christi, Texas and inspired Mirella to do the same. As she moves out of her current location (which requires all vendors to sell new items), Mirella plans to obtain furniture to sell. Mirella\u2019s cousin was also the person who informed her about Accion Texas Inc., which saved a trip to a traditional bank. \r\n\r\nUpon approval of the loan, Mirella purchased inventory for the store. The combination of the loan and her savings paid for business cards, a 13-week ad in Laredo\u2019s <i>Bargain Book<\/i>, a new sign, rent, fire department and other necessary permits, and part of the deposit.  She says the loan will also help her buy the initial merchandise she needs.\r\n\r\nMirella currently employs her daughter-in-law and does not plan to hire more employees until her business flourishes. She plans to re-invest her earnings into the growth of <i>It\u2019s New to Me<\/i> and have a Grand Opening party in the near future to notify the community of her store.

Since then he has brought this business ahead with his own capital. Before, he also sold fried food but decided to stop because it didn't generate many profits to support his family. The business of renting rooms is another source of income.\r\n\r\nHe requests the loan to buy sacks of potatoes and onions, the products that he lacks in his sales booth. He values that the loan will help him, since he will invest it in his business to improve and supply the products that are in demand with his clients.

They live in a rented house in the district of San Pedro de Cajas \u2013 Tarma.\r\n\r\nShe has been through some difficult times. One of them was the separation from her husband. Now she is feeling better and with more motivation to work for her children. She makes weavings by hand on looms. She has been doing this work for more than 10 years. During this time she learned better strategies to sell her products more quickly. One of them is the uniqueness of her designs and the variety of the items that she makes, such as pullover sweaters, ponchos, gloves, hats, and shawls. She makes them with different qualities of wool. She also makes blankets, which is what earns her the greatest income. \u201cI make 5 blankets per month and I sell them for use in Cerro de Pasco (a city with a very cold climate),\u201d she explains. But to do this, she has to invest $35.00 per kilo of alpaca wool. \r\n\r\nThanks to her characteristic optimism, she can sell her products for use in cities like Lima, Huancayo, and Ayacucho. In this way she is able to provide her children with a decent quality of life. And, since she isn\u2019t a woman who just conforms to her situation, she also works in agriculture. She plants potatoes and high-quality maca [a traditional food and medicinal plant], since the soil in her area is rich in minerals.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she says she will be punctual with her monthly repayments. She likes the other members of her communal bank, \u201cMujeres al Futuro,\u201d because they are responsible and support one another.\r\n\r\nElvia will use the requested money to buy several kilograms of alpaca wool to make pullover sweaters, shawls, and blankets.

She lives with Raul, who works in forestry and is the father of her two daughters:  Greysi, age 17, and Andrea, age 15.  They own the home in which they live.\r\n\r\nHer job is selling a variety of merchandise such as jewellery, clothing and beauty products, all of good quality and in a variety of fashionable styles.  Her merchandise is acquired through her trips to the capital, and she sells it from her home to her neighbors and friends. She treats them in a friendly and cordial way, and they recommend her to other people.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start this business because she needed more income to meet her needs, as she was unable to pay for certain necessities.  She was able to do this more than 2 years ago with the help of a loan from MFP.  Until now she has been doing it alone, although her partner helps her sometimes in seeking new clients.  She considers her business to be profitable, because her earnings from it help to pay bills and to educate her daughters.  Now, seeing the income that she has earned, she wants to invest in opening a store in her home, where she can sell her products.  This is her second loan with MFP.

They have four children who are in school.  They live in their own home in the indigenous community of Santa Rosa de Ubiriki in Chanchamayo.\r\n<p>\r\nAt a young age, Pablo worked on his parents' farmland and learned the trade in this manner.  He now utilizes his experience to support his family.  Pablo has a plot of land on which he grows cassava, citrus fruits, bananas, and annatto.  \"All of these products are profitable, but only if you know how to negotiate,\" says Pablo.  Last year he harvested 8,000 kilos of annatto, each kilo selling for 5 PEN.  He generated good earnings, which enabled him to continue planting.  Pablo earns extra income for his daily expenses by working as a laborer on other farms.  A large portion of his production is sold at the fruit markets in neighboring cities.  When the buyers from different cities arrive, he gets paid a fair price for his harvest.  One of his future goals is to acquire more land so that he can expand his annatto and cassava crops.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his eighth loan with MFP and Pablo gives his word that he will be punctual with his loan payments.  In addition, he is pleased that the members of his Communal Bank,  \"Las Rositas de Ubiriki\" (The Little Roses of Ubiriki), are responsible.

Through this loan and hard work, they hope to increase their stock of rabbits so that they can begin to work with distributors. Mohammad and his wife are working to increase their family income and improve their standard of living. The purpose of this loan is to buy an incubator and rabbit enclosures.\r\n\r\nRyada's Startup Loan is exclusively for borrowers who are beginning new enterprises, not for existing projects. To qualify, a borrower must show a clear business plan and realistic potential for success. The borrower must also invest their own money and resources into at least 50 percent of the startup enterprise. Ryada believes strongly in the potential of these borrowers and grants them a three month grace period to help them get their business off the ground."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1099347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Arab

She feels supported by the united and responsible members, and so promises to make her repayments punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the money that she is currently requesting, she will be able to purchase fertilizers for her plantain crops, and will be able to pay the personnel she hires to remove the weeds from her plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1092224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers and hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juaquina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1058.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121674}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T13:08:25Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":428249,"name":"Mwarandu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwarandu is a resident of Mariakani, Kenya.
