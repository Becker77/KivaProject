She has full confidence that with her work and with help from God and this institution she will reach her dream of giving her family better living conditions that are different from the ones they have now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1092605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":65.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98,"local_amount":98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049668},{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":50.87,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":50.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521305},{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":57.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":57.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349738},{"amount":107.25,"local_amount":107.25,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321106},{"amount":59.74,"local_amount":59.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":59.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929682},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":132.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":132.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339845983},{"amount":58.77,"local_amount":58.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":58.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347003904},{"amount":64.99,"local_amount":64.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":64.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447276},{"amount":70.23,"local_amount":70.23,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":70.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450533}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T16:08:41Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":428276,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisa is a farmer from San Miguel, Bohol.

Ana es una mujer ejemplar la cual cada d\u00eda se levanta muy temprano para poder cumplir con sus tareas del hogar y luego salir a hacer su recorrido en las diferentes \u00e1reas de la zona donde habita para ofrecer sus productos. Trabaja muy duro ya que siempre est\u00e1 pensando en la forma de colaborar con la econom\u00eda del hogar ya que los ingresos de su esposo no son suficientes para cubrir todas las necesidades del hogar que cada vez son mayores.

Ana is an exemplary woman who rises very early every day to do her household chores and then go out to various areas around where she lives offering her products.  She works very hard and is always thinking of ways to help with the family economy since her husband\u2019s income is insufficient to cover all household expenses which are higher every day.  It\u2019s worth stressing that her husband works as a bricklayer and often is out of work because he has to wait for projects to happen that he can offer his services to so he does not have steady income.\r\n\r\nFor Ana, the most important thing is that her family we well and able to enjoy better conditions than she\u2019s had.  All of this compels her to work very hard and to find ways to make her business grow.  Based on the above, she\u2019s made the decision to ask INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in the business buying a variety of clothes like blouses, skirts, dresses, pants and other items to attract more customers and meet their needs.  She trusts that based on this decision she will succeed in increasing profits and be able to improve her and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1092625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.18,"local_amount":79.18,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319369},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":82.51,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049672},{"amount":82.16,"local_amount":82.16,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":82.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521309},{"amount":84.76,"local_amount":84.76,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329927},{"amount":171.39,"local_amount":171.39,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":171.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349741}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T02:00:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":428281,"name":"Gabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabina is a widow from San Miguel, Bohol.

She plans to use the profit earned through this loan to further expand her livestock herd. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1097135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Semenovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T22:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T22:00:48Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-21T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50057.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329847},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50057.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458680}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T12:31:51Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":425201,"name":"Elsi De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsi de Jes\u00fas de treinta y siete a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida en casa propia.

He lives with his life partner, their children, and his granddaughter.  He works in agriculture, growing corn and beans in a very rural area.  He has many years of experience in this field and he always tries to have the best crops in order to satisfy his customers.  People prefer him because his products are top quality and he sells them at low prices. He also provides the best service in the area.  This work provides good earnings and for this reason he wants to invest more in order to improve his liquidity.  Miguel is an entrepreneurial man, a fighter, and very humble.  He thinks that the secret to his work is consistency and responsibility, which are requirements for great success.

She and her husband get up very early to go to the small farm where they produce cocoa, which is the product that generates the most income to support her family. \r\n\r\nHer favourite thing about working is really dedicating herself to what she is doing, since in this way she can increase her harvests. The thing she finds most difficult about her work is carrying the sacks from harvest from the farm to the town. \r\n\r\nHer future plans are to have a grocery store, but at the moment she hopes to maintain her crops fertile. This is her third loan with MFP. In her communal bank she feels happy working with people who support her and share their experiences.

She also aspires to purchase an ox plow from the additional profits from this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1099584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Likoni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loise  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":757}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6.35,"local_amount":451.09,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":535.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287632798},{"amount":4.58,"local_amount":325.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":386.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294404869},{"amount":2.62,"local_amount":186.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":221.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301459304},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":3397.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4033.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308454320},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":3384.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315658977},{"amount":40.93,"local_amount":2905.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3449.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323055735}],"funded_date":"2012-05-21T00:05:01Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:31:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":428337,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is a resident of Likoni, Kenya.

Her husband and one of her sons make a living through brick laying.  Her other children are in school.  They want to better themselves and become professionals.  Her oldest son helps Ana with her bakery business that is located in her home.  This is how she manages to provide the daily bread for her home given that apart from her husband's income and the income she makes from her business, she doesn't have another source of income.  This is why she works hard to be able to give her family economic stability and to help with what is possible with her children's education.  She is very well-known in the area as a hard-working, responsible, and honorable person.  Thanks to her charisma and good service, she has been able to establish some fixed customers who prefer her more every day.  Her wish is to be able to maintain her business for a long time to continue contributing to her family's income.  This is why she is requesting this loan since she wants to invest in basic supplies like: flour, sugar, yeast, oil, food coloring, and other necessary items to make her delicious bread.  With this decision, she hopes to be able to accomplish her goal of having a larger supply, which will let her strengthen her bakery and support her home.

Los deseos de lograr superarse econ\u00f3micamente para obtener mejores condiciones de vida, hicieron que Ruth iniciara vendiendo productos de limpieza e higiene, granos b\u00e1sicos, golosinas y otros alimentos de bajo costo que son adquiridos por sus vecinos y personas con acceso cercano a la tienda.

Debido al carisma y motivaci\u00f3n, de Ruth y su hermano, la tienda se mantiene funcionando pero necesitan acceder a un pr\u00e9stamo que les permita adquirir productos para la venta como: frijoles, az\u00facar, huevos, arroz, detergentes y otros bienes de primera necesidad para la tienda y as\u00ed ser un negocio que ofrezca mayor atractivos para los clientes, por contar con m\u00e1s variedad de productos para la venta.

Driven by the desire to get ahead economically to achieve a better quality of life, Ruth began selling cleaning and hygiene products, basic grains, candies, and other low-cost foods. These products are purchased by their neighbors and others who have close access to the store.\r\n\r\nRuth is the primary attendant in the store but her brother also helps the customers each afternoon when he returns from work. The store is a family effort to maintain a source of income that is so important for the two of them. \r\n\r\nThe store continues to run thanks to the charisma and motivation of Ruth and her brother, but they need a loan that will allow them to acquire more products to sell, such as beans, sugar, eggs, rice, detergents, and other essential goods. The business will offer more attractions to the customers and will have a greater variety of products for sale. In this way, Ruth hopes to give more stability to the business and increase their income, which will allow the two of them to improve their quality of life.

She is a single parent, brining up three children on her own. For 15 years, Jiparkul has been raising livestock, having launched this business with a starting capital of 20,000 KGS. Thanks to Jiparkul's hard work, her farm at present includes one cow, one horse, eight goats and eight sheep. Sales of milk and dairy products bring about 18,000 KGS monthly. In order to develop her business further, Jiparkul has turned to \"Bai Tushum& Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS in order to buy additional farm animals for fattening.

He makes a living growing basic grains like corn and sorghum. It is worth mentioning that not only does he grow the basic grains, but he also sells the products after the harvest at the main markets in his area. He has 10 years of experience in this activity, so he has gained a lot of knowledge about the trade. He is requesting the loan because the harvest season has begun but he does not have the means to invest in his crops on his own. He plans to use the loan to purchase agricultural supplies like seeds, manure and fertilizers, which are necessary in order to have a good harvest. He has a lot of confidence in the support of this institution, with which he will be able to start sowing his land and obtain a good harvest, and in this way he can continue bringing home the daily bread for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1093560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds, manure, fertilizers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-21T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-20T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082964}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T05:40:32Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:08:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":428409,"name":"Leonora's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonora is married and has two children.

She is a fifth grade teacher, but she has also been working as a moneylender for the past year. Greta gives small loans to other people in her community, such as friends and neighbors who need emergency funds or who are investing in machinery. Greta makes a profit by charging interest on the loans. \r\n\r\nA loan will help Greta continue her business of loaning capital to those who may not otherwise have access to financial services.

She lives in her own home with her family in the western part of the country in a rural area. She works in agriculture, mainly growing corn and millet. She has been doing this activity for many years and it has permitted her to meet the daily expenses of the home. This is her main source of income as she knows no other way of earning an honest wage. She sells part of her harvest in the major markets of the area where she lives and she saves a part for consumption by her family as you can see in the photo.

She is a dealer of beauty products. She looks for potential dealers where if she succeeds to recruit these potential dealers, she would have a commission for it. Another way is that she sells the beauty products which she gets from the distributor at a much cheaper price. She wishes to help her grandchildren in their financial needs for schooling.\r\n\r\nIn order to help her continue her work, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy more products from the distributor. She earns around 1,500 PHP weekly out of recruitment and selling products.\r\n\r\nConchita dreams to someday have enough money to renovate their house and then have land investments. She also dreams that she will have her own established outlet for her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

The residents raise livestock, farm, and work in businesses; many of them work in the city at various activities. Our members are kind, charming, and hardworking people, who are always seeking more household income to support their families, while maintaining their culture and traditions.\r\n\r\nCarmita, one of the group members, lives in Punta Corral on the outskirts of Cuenca.  She is 41 years old, married, and has 8 children from her marriage.  Two of the children are married; two work and help her financially; and the youngest four children attend school in the city. Her husband is a security guard. They do not have their own home, so they live with other family members. \r\n\r\nCarmita takes care of the house, since her children are still young and need her care. She raises guinea pigs at home. She has been a member of the communal bank for two years. She will use this loan to buy pigs to get started raising and selling these animals. Her goal is to grow this business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1094001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-05-21T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-20T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":4850,"lender_count":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alcira Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Trancito De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Eliuzabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana Dejes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmita Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":404.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":404.17,"local_amount":404.17,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":404.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321600},{"amount":808.34,"local_amount":808.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":808.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209204},{"amount":808.34,"local_amount":808.34,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":808.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335522},{"amount":808.34,"local_amount":808.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":808.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391301},{"amount":808.34,"local_amount":808.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":808.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150207},{"amount":1212.47,"local_amount":1212.47,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383354}],"funded_date":"2012-05-30T02:29:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":428551,"name":"Elshan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elshan is a 29-year-old, single man.

45, runs a taxi business in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. He has been running his business for 2 years and his daily earnings are about 30,000 MNT total. He lives with his wife and his 3 children in a ger, a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt which is on his plot of land. His wife is unemployed and 2 sons attend secondary school. Living in a ger is quite cold in the wintertime and it costs a lot for the heating by smoky coal. So he decided to build a new small house which will use a panel-heating system without any smoky coal usage. He thinks it is a very environmental and natural-oriented thing to decrease the air pollution around the city. Now he needs about 2,700,000 MNT to buy the necessary building materials to build his new family

He sells 8 tons of melons, 4 tons of maize and 450 kg of nuts on average per year. Paata sells the harvested products locally to greengrocery retailers. Total average monthly income of the family is 900 Laris.\r\n\r\nPaata requested a loan for purchasing fertilizers and for renting a tractor to till the land. After tilling and fertilizing the plot, Paata will work hard during the spring and summer seasons. He hopes that the weather conditions are favorable as well, and that he will get a good harvest in late summer, which can be sold for a fair price through the known channels.

She lives together with her husband and her two children who are 14 and 3 years old.  She loves her children dearly and works hard so that she is able to provide them with a decent life and a better future.  Ysaura's home is located in the city of Pisco.  This city is noted for its hot climate, its beautiful beaches, and its tourist spots which include 'el Candelabro' (a prehistoric geoglyph) and the Ballestas Islands.  These places receive a large number of tourists throughout the year.  Whenever she has any time free, Ysaura enjoys going out for walks with her little ones in order to have fun and spend time together.  She also enjoys eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious 'chilcano' (a soup made from tuna and seaweed) and duck with rice.  Ysaura only managed to study at high school but she would have liked to have gone on to study accountancy.\r\n\r\nYsaura works, with a lot of enthusiasm, in her business buying and selling recycled materials.  She works around 11 hours a day and can serve up to ten customers.  She works alongside her husband who is a great support and her right-hand man.

She lives in the Soledad municipality, which is where she sells cold drinks. She also sells merchandise on credit and by order. \r\n\r\nShe started her business in 2002, when she found her niche in the market so that she could generate income.  She discovered that the businesses close to her home did not have beer on the week-ends because the distributers only came two times a week.  She decided to have what these businesses needed.\r\n\r\nShe initially started with two baskets of beer in order to test the market.  As she was very well-received, she was interested in investing in this business.  Now, it is one of the most important income generators that she has.  She couples this with her retail distribution of merchandise, an alternative income through which she takes advantage of her captive clientele.\r\n\r\nShe currently does not have enough working capital to respond to her growing clientele.  That is exactly the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy cases of beer in order to increase her potential sales.  She will also be prepared with varied merchandise in order to respond to the seasons when there is the greatest commercial movement like family and religious holidays. She will buy clothes and lingerie to give her customers on credit, which is to be paid in a time period of no greater than 60 days.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to expand her business in order to get greater income.

Yasmith has done very well in her business and she has regular customers who order items from her.  She also sells blouses and has an existing market for her products.  Her dream is to have her own commercial premises where she can display her merchandise and to become an important wholesaler, providing products to retailers.  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this year, when the owner of some business premises offered to rent them to her at a good price because she was moving away from the city, Yasmith became interested in the offer and took advantage of it.  This is where her general store is now located and she would like to grow her business.  However, she does not have enough working capital.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (the first loan she has taken out from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the loan to buy school supplies, decorations, gifts and clothing.  Her investment will be successful because her business is located in a commercial area that is very busy with passersby.

","en":"Alirio is 54 years old and lives in the southwestern portion of the city, where he performs many productive activities. On one hand, he distributes bakery products, sells hens and pigs, and he also sells candy. His cultural traditions are those of the Cauca Valley where he comes from. And from there, he arrived in the city of Barranquilla 15 years ago. Alirio graduated from secondary school and began studying aviation, but only for 1 year, since his family's income would not permit more. For that reason, he has dedicated the greater part of his life to raising small farm animals and cultivating the earth.\r\n\r\nIn Barranquilla at present, he has succeeded in establishing himself in commerce and food distribution, including baked goods and candy. He distributes these, store to store, on his own motorcycle everyday -- cookies, Swiss rolls, and other products derived from wheat flour -- while on weekends, he sells pigs and 'criolla' hens, and has lately added fish.\r\n\r\nAlirio's distant goal is to have a fish-raising enterprise and then, to acquire his own house.
