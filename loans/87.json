Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

Now, Carmen wishes to apply for a loan from ASHI amounting to Php 7,000 to be used in the same kind of business. Given a chance to receive the bigger loan, the volume of commodities she will sell will be increased and she can help many people from their village have access to commodities with less effort and time consumed.\r\n\r\nDespite her age, Carmen wants to maximize her remaining strength and capacity in her business so as to have savings. In this way, she can obtain the security of tenure she wishes for herself when she grows very old. As a single, old woman, she believes that there will be nobody to take care of her nor shelter her when she becomes very old unless she has money. \r\n\r\nCarmen, though, is very positive that she

She lives in the Ciudadela 20 de Julio neighborhood in the city of Baranquilla. She works in general merchandise and she has three children: 30, 28 and 19 years old. She has been a client of the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for 20 years and she has received 29 credits during that time. They have really changed her lifestyle, including the education goals of her children. This one that she is asking for now is to pay for her younger daughter's 5th semester.  \r\n\r\nShe grew up with her parents and her twelve siblings in the Nueva Esperanza neighborhood. Since she was twelve, she has been working selling childrens' dresses and other merchandise. She would pay her monthly tuition and help support her family with the profits she obtained. Suffering from domestic trauma, she had to leave her high school studies halfway through and begin to work as a store employee. Gradually, she gained the confidence of her bosses and without any schooling in it became the manager of this business. She left this ten years later. With her severance package she bought the home she still lives in with her three children. They are her reason for being and it is they who drive her to work and make an effort every day to get them ahead.   \r\n\r\nLuz Marina, with the motto \"I never look back, only ahead\", is a fighter who has been separated for the last 17 years. Her business card is an independent, honest and responsible job with which she has been able to give her three children professional educations. She has been supported with education loans for her family. These are only given to good clients at the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. This organization has given her financing to strengthen her business of merchandise sales, which she distributes throughout Baranquilla. She states that her business is the sale of shoes, clothing, appliances, gold and silver jewelry, miscelaneous and paper products. It has been going for 30 years and its smooth operation is the product of her experience acquired as a store employee and from entering the loan program at the Fundacion, which has lent her money to increase her working capital. This has meant prosperity for her and has allowed her to finish many of her projects and goals. One of these is to watch her youngest daughter become a professional. This is why she is aplying for a loan in the amount of $1.575.532. Another goal is to have her own locale in the center of town. All of her life she has been in the business of various merchandise and she wants to continue growing. \r\n\r\nWith her years of experience as a business person, she says that \"It's not all profit.\" Her clients buy her merchandise on credit and at times she has had to lose with some clients. This is why she takes references into account and she wants her clients to be employed. Her dream is for her daughter to finish college and her goal is to have a locale in downtown Baranquilla.        \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":475756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Her daughter's college education ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1575532,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":254484},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":256100},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":260368},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":264707},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":269119},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":270754}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":254484,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":257300.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913413},{"amount":130.04,"local_amount":256100,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":258934.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949027},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":260368,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":263249.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677817},{"amount":134.41,"local_amount":264707,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":267636.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712191},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":269119,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":272097.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895697},{"amount":137.48,"local_amount":270754,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":273750.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636021}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T16:32:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":177315,"name":"Merilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merilyn is a rice farmer from Banga, South Cotabato.

Married to Rodolph Ahouassa, S\u00e9raphine is the mother of three children, all in school, of whom two are currently in her care. The couple provide for the family together. S\u00e9raphine never attended school. For 35 years, she has run a business selling cereals (beans, rice, maize, etc.) at her store located in Agla. As a secondary activity, S\u00e9raphine also sells charcoal. Her business provides her with an income that she uses to meet her various needs and those of her family. S\u00e9raphine gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin.

By working hard in her vegetables vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,500. Lourdes is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more vegetables to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lourdes aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He produces rice and corn on land given to him by his father, who, he still helps and work with. He lives with his girlfriend, who he hopes to marry and start a family with in the near future. He will invest the loan so he can plant for the next cycle by preparing the land, and buying fertilizer and seeds. He does not have children but is still very family oriented, as he is close to his mother, father and brothers. He hopes he can fix the lands so they can be productive for years to come.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. <\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by big large companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans, as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming <\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plough the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are no drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of products including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many of the loans will also go towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":30427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice and Corn Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T23:41:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-03T21:28:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21439},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:39:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31816},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:32:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51902},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107783}],"funded_date":"2007-04-19T21:28:36Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12941,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs N. is 47 years and has 4 sons and one daughter ages 27-18.

To buy her merchandise, she used to go to AZOVE in the Mono but wasn't able to create a large enough inventory due to her limited means.  She then came to obtain an initial loan of 50,000 francs CFA to grow her capital.  From there, she added to her business the sale of condiments, since after the initial loan, her operating capital increased.  With the experience she acquired with regards to commerce, and because of growing demands from customers, she is presently requesting a third loan of 100,000 francs.  With these funds, she is thinking of again diversifying her business by buying, in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, children's clothing for distribution, which is also going to enable her to find other types of customers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nA.

She is 64 years old and has been a member of the Yoff credit union since March 2001. She already benefited from three previous loans. She is married without children but keeps busy selling French fries, fruit juice and custard. She also has a sewing activity. She counts a little over two years of experience. Untimely power cuts are the main reason for her discontinuing her sewing activity and redirecting all her efforts towards selling juice and fries. Therefore she is requesting a 200,000 francs loan to build up a stock of the ingredients she uses to make her products (potatoes, powdered milk, sugar). Her objective is to maximize profits to fulfill her personal needs and also to initiate future projects; this is all in order to improve her family's living conditions.\n\nMadame Malmouna is pictured

She has made a living for the past four years selling groceries out of a small convenience store installed in her home. The business started out of the necessity to find an activity to generate income to solve personal expenses and support her family, whose finances depend on agriculture, which isn't permanent income. At her small business, she offers all kinds of snacks and drinks to her customer. This is very useful to her neighbors since the area is located a little ways outside of the city. She prefers to buy products in small quantities and always travels to the city of Chiclayo to stock her business with fresh products. The business has been well-received, and she wishes to expand it by purchasing a wider variety of groceries. For this, she has requested for the first time from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa a loan of 1500 soles to achieve her objective.

Many years ago, he lived in the city of Urubamba, where he had a hardware store. He had to close it because there was a lot of competition and he did not have many customers. \r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, Oscar moved to Ollantaytambo, where he had some friends and distant family members who encouraged him to open a store. He used the money from the liquidation of his hardware store to open a new store in the city of Ollantaytambo, where he sells paint, cement, nails, metal sheets, sandpaper, and much more. He has operated this business for ten years, and it is going very well for him, thanks to the dedication he puts into the business. With the benefits he obtains from his work, he has helped his three children get ahead. \r\n\r\nOscar is a responsible and hard-working father who presents an image of experience and professionalism. A regular flow of customers visits his store, but his sales are low in the month of March, due to the rains that fall in the city.

She and her husband, a pensioner, have a small dairy business. They have had to work hard their entire lives, mostly in low-skilled, physically exhausting jobs. They dreamed of having a dairy farm of their own and living peacefully, watching after the livestock and drinking fresh milk. \r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago, the couple's dream showed the first signs of becoming a reality. They saved sizable funds and bought their first dairy cow. This purchase was very overwhelming and meaningful for Bermet\u2019s belief and motivation. Now the business has several heads of cattle and generates a profit of 2,000 KGS monthly and up to 3-4 liters of milk daily, which is further sold for 11 KGS per liter. It\u2019s been ten years since the start of the business, and the couple helped organize a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Bermet's short term goals include purchasing 2 sheep in order to diversify the household. Bermet believes in Kiva lenders\u2019 assistance to reach this goal. Bermet's long-term goal and big wish is to build a big shed for her cattle. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Six of her eight children are in school, and she and her husband have to work where there are opportunities to make some money. She gets up very early to make breakfast for her kids and also makes lunch before she heads off to her farmland with her husband. She doesn't work exclusively on her own land, but also also works as a day laborer on other people's crops. She cultivates passion fruit and coffee, but this time she also wants to include caigua, a regional plant that will take only four months to produce with high margins, especially in the summer. Lola is very pleased with her business. When she isn't in the fields, she takes her products to the local markets. Meanwhile her husband (holding the box of beer in the photo) stays at home selling soft drinks, sandwiches and beer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<\/em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

O. is a married woman who lives in Purok Cosmos, Brgy. Doldol, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  livestock and farming. Her husband Eliseo, who is 46 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 15 and 26 years old.\r\n\r\nCecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,200, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use for additional capital for her livestock business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Cecilia O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The group gave itself this name in honour of the locality where the members live. La Cruz de Itacuan is located 15 minutes from Pinotepa and the majority of its inhabitants speak the Mixteca language and work in the countryside raising goats. Their representative is named Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, all the members of the group dedicate their time to personal work and the sale of some regionally consumed products. \r\n\r\nWe will make space to talk a little about the life of one member of this group. Mrs. Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, who is 39 years old, is the representative of the group and is married to Aron, 40 years old, who is a public transport taxi driver. She has 4 children: Mirna, 18; Natali, 11; Rafael 9; and Dalila, 8 years old. They are all currently studying. \r\n\r\nFrancisca has sold pork for more than 6 years. She likes her work, even though for some there is nothing pleasant in sacrificing animals, this is a way to contribute to the family expenses and school expenses of her children. She has her own pig farm, which she aquires when they are young and looks after them and feeds them until they are adults to be sold, either by gross weight or cut up. This activity is not very common in her community but she saw the need to enter into this area. With this activity she can boost the internal personal consumption of the production and raising of pigs within the community. Her husband is very proud of her and he helps her to cut the meat and with the production of pork chicharr\u00f3n. For those who don't know what chicharr\u00f3n is, it's the skin of the pig, which is cooked in boiling fat until becoming golden. It's a traditional food of the Mexican people.     \r\n\r\nFrancisca formed a loan group primarily for her need of a loan and the need of her fellow group members. She used this resource for the purchase of pigs, the maintenance of their pen and to feed the pigs which she herself is raising. She was able to acquire more firewood to cook chicharr\u00f3n, chili peppers to make chorizo and meat seasoned with chili. One of Francisca's biggest dreams is to have a big pig farm, to increase the number of animals, and by this way she will be able to give work to the people who live in this town so that they develop and are able to progress, since government resources are poorly invested. She wants to promote the raising of animals for personal consumption within the zone, but for this it's necessary to have more support investment from everyone and the effort and commitment of more people who want to get ahead. She also aspires to have her own commercial premises for the sale of meat as well as the necessary equipment to further facilitate her work. She also wants her children to prepare themselves professionally, to earn a living with better opportunities, and for them to be able to achieve their dreams and those of those who surround them.    \r\n\r\nAll the people who make up this group are very hard-working women, full of motivation. They are very happy, and despite the situation in which some of them live, they believe in the fulfillment of their dreams and in the goodness of other people who serve others. They are very fulfilled with their commitments, with their families and with their people. This is a characteristic of the indigenous people who live in this part of Oaxaca.  \r\n\r\nFrancisca is extremely thankful for the nobility of those who support different groups throughout the world, in this way making possible the dreams of many and improving the lives of those most needy. On behalf of the members of this group, she sends fraternal greetings to whoever sees this story as well as a big hug to those who support her project.\r\n\r\nBelow are given the names of the members of the \"Itacuan\" group as well as their production activities: \r\n\r\nHeriberta Rafaela R.

Kholburi is 25 years old. He is married with 3 kids. Kholburi is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming. Now, he has acquired a fair amount of experience in agriculture. Currently, Kholburi is very happy, because of his kids who are the motivation for his desire to grow his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more inputs: seeds and fertilizer to sow for a good harvest so he can take care of his children and his home.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Following her father's death, she moved to the Ak-Suu village together with her family, so that they could be closer to relatives.  After completing school, Aida was accepted to the Financial College, but, unfortunately, did not finish it because she got married.  She had a son while she was married, then got divorced, and moved in with her mother.  Today, Aida is the sole provider for her nine-year-old son and paralyzed mother.  In order to provide for her small family, Aida got involved in sales of food products.  Using an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), she decided to open a small store on the property of her own house.  Currently, she has 30,000 som (KGS) in her turnover, and she plans to expand her business.  Aida requested a loan in the sum of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company specifically to achieve this goal by expanding her merchandise selection.  Hardworking and goal-oriented Aida dreams of helping her mother get back on her feet and providing all of the conditions for a happy life for her son.

Feliciana and her husband have owned and operated a thriving business in carpentry and wood sales for more than 15 years. While her husband hand crafts beautiful pieces of furniture, Feliciana takes care of the logistical side of the business taking out loans and managing all financial aspects. Chairs, tables, armoires, and many other exquisite pieces of work are produced within the walls of their workshop which is set up next door to their small home. Once each week, a large bus is rented to take them just outside the city limits of Ayacucho, Peru, where they purchase huge supplies of wood to bring home and craft. As well, they also take a portion of the wood supply to a Sunday market, where it is sold to other carpenters in the area. They also bring their hand-crafted furniture and sell it at the market. <P>\r\n\r\nFeliciana has accomplished a great deal in the past 15 years, much of which she attributes to the great help provided her through her village bank. After her first three years of taking out loans and saving money, she and her husband were able to buy a car. Three years after that, they bought a large truck for wood shipments. Today, they continue to save with the goal of funding the university education of her 2 sons. As well, Feliciana would very much like to open a small grocery store from their home, and they are currently in the process of adding a second floor to their house. These are ambitious goals that Feliciana has set for herself, however, she has proven several times over that when she sets a goal, she accomplishes it. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough her hard work, Feliciana has been able to provide amazing opportunities to her family, and because of this they all appreciate her participation in her village bank.

They are sweetened with sugar and enhanced with spices like cinnamon and cloves for a more distinctive flavor. Hector's hopes are to make his business into a candy factory where he can hire staff to make the candy and move forward to a more administrative position. He hopes to become a lead candy distributor in the San Pedro province. \r\n\r\nJackelin, on the other hand, has a colmado: a small convenience store where she sells the daily meal items. She will use this loan to buy canned goods like beans and sardines. The Dominican Republic suffers serious power outages and a lot of people do not own a refrigerator, so canned goods are a more convenient option, being less perishable. Her hopes are that the profits of her colmado will allow her one day to build a house with firmer materials.\r\n \r\nThese entrepreneurs have shown outstanding credit behavior and great will to work.

She is 50 years old. Angelita is married and has seven adult children. To make a living, Angelita owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling pre-packed snack foods, dairy products and daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Angelita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Angelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Angelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Munavvar is 43-year old loving mother of three children. For more than 17 years, Munavvar has sold fish in the central fish market of the city. \r\n\r\nWhen she started she had only $100 United States dollars (USD) in turnover. With time, her business expanded and today it is a quite stable business. Munavvar has requested a loan in the amount of $1,500 USD. She wants to purchase a quantity of fish at wholesale prices in order to have stock to sell during the New Year's celebration when fishing is prohibited. Munavvar has shown herself to be a reliable client and has been already provided with the loan by IMON. She would like to thank everyone for their support.  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She buys entrails from local butchers and cleans them, then resells to food vendors.

Both are fried dishes; the latter is fried over red-hot coals and the former is prepared in a normal pot.\r\n\r\nRossi wishes to expand her business selling offals to distribute to larger restaurants.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his parents\u2019 house with his life parter, 24 year old Erica, and their small one year old daughter, G\u00e9nesis.\r\n\r\nUsing what his parents taught him about farming, he now devotes himself to growing peas.  His fields are located on the Peruvian mountain range.  He also plants potatoes on large tracts of rented land on the coast.  His siblings help him with the crops.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes best is harvesting the produce.  He likes it because when he sells the produce he sees his earnings as the recompense for all of his sacrifice.  He has been farming for five yeas.  He has managed to get a farm with a wide expanse of land.  He has also been able to cover the household expenses.  Above all, he has been saving for the future.\r\n\r\nHe has a lot of plans.  Among those plans is planting in greater quantity.  He also plans to set up a business selling fuel and a vehicle maintenance shop.  He knows about automobile mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.  He really likes working together with the rest of the group\u2019s members in his communal bank.  Carlos plans to use the requested money to buy various sacks of fertilizer to spread on his developed pea crops.  He will also get pea and potato seeds.  That way he hopes to get better income with the new production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":568140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and seeds to improve the productivity of his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-16T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1553.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886542}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T01:36:22Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":218677,"name":"Divina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Divina D. lives in the town of Surallah.

She lives in Sitio Tata-an, Brgy. Bato, Toledo City, Cebu. Merlin has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. Merlin now earns an average monthly income of PHP 2500. Merlin wants to borrow PHP 11000 so that she can  purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Merlin aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has been working in the noble field of agriculture for 15 years now. In all this time, she has accumulated much knowledge and she is happy for it. Her principal crops are coffee and plantains, which she sells in the same place, where after each harvest she boxes up and sells to the wholesale customers who come on Tuesdays and Thursdays. <P>\r\n\r\nFelicita is very pleased with the results she has obtained. Because of it, she wants to tackle planting more products like avocados and citrus fruits. This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is very grateful. She says that thanks to the support of her community bank, she was able to advance. She plans to use the funds from the loan to purchase 10 sacks of fertilizer, the value of which oscillates around 90 soles. With this fertilizer, she can maintain her coffee production levels, keeping high quality. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":649388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 10 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oxapampa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10.333333 -75.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.29},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.29,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":222.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725415},{"amount":79.29,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":222.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463513},{"amount":79.29,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":222.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886896},{"amount":79.28,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":222.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327249},{"amount":79.29,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":222.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195819},{"amount":78.56,"local_amount":215,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":220.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269482}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T14:29:01Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Harrison","image":180524}},{"id":255561,"name":"Savat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Savat C.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Benson will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Khasiro group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":935143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-05T06:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":22400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":22400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24612.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681243}],"funded_date":"2011-12-11T18:10:53Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":370331,"name":"Withiakh Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 09 JUILLET 2002.

Currently, her capital is at $150, and her business brings in a profit of $60 per week.  Her ambition is to open a beverages outlet.  She has become a loyal member of a HOPE group since December 2008.\r\n\r\nEvelyne is married and the mother of seven children, ranging in age from 7 to 23 years, who are all students.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":325573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy nine cases of sweet drinks to resell in order to grow her revenues ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Milagros group.  It is comprised of 11 members, 5 men and 6 women.  They are friends who have known each other for a long time because they all live in the same neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is a member who stands out in the group.  He is a bricklayer, and he is a very hard-working man.  During the day he works on big jobs with contractors, and in the evenings he works on small jobs in private houses.  His wife helps him in order to be able to get greater income and give their children a better quality of life.  He lives in a rental until he is able to get together the money to buy a lot and have his own house.  To do this he needs to keep working to fulfill his dream.  Andr\u00e9s will use the loan to buy tools to put down tiles and be able to do more jobs in less time.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group work at different commercial activities like selling chicken, selling yogurt, selling meat and vegetables, a store, carpentry, and one member is a mechanic.  Competition exists, but the members are well known because they have lived in the area for over 25 years, and they have established customers.\r\n\r\nThe loan is for operating capital and investment in their businesses.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 30 years old and single. To make a living, Gilbert owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a fishing boat to catch and sell assorted fish to the market.
