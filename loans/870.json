is 49-year-old Fatmata. She is a widow and has one 15-year-old child. She has three additional dependents who live with her because they serve as sales assistants. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Fatmata established her textiles business. She began her business to empower her to care for her child. Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about 1,900,000 SLL every month. \r\n\r\nFatmata would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan to buy materials like poplin, siphon, and cheek.

With this great experience and an understanding for the diversity of products that can be made from plastic and what goes into manufacturing them, Ricardo decide to start a business in this field. He decided to start a wholesale business that purchased and sold machines that were used for specialized plastic manufacturing. He saw no limits to his company and began selling domestically in the United States and internationally. He mainly sells to large companies and focuses most of his marketing to this kind of buyer. His business has seen significant growth since its founding and now employs three employees in addition to Ricardo.

She and her husband work as farmers in order to feed their three children, two daughters and one son, who are still in school. For ten years, Sinuon has been planting cassava as a primary source of income for her family. She supplements this income by planting rubber trees. With the current business, she can earn around 21,600 KHR per day and can save around 9,000 KHR each day for the future. Falling cassava prices are the main challenge she faces in her business.

She engages in various activities.  Soledad starts very early by selling wool, but her inventory sells quickly because she has been doing this for 30 years and knows how her business should operate.  She also looks after her parcels of land where she grows vegetables such as spinach, peas, lettuce, carrots, and other crops.  Soledad is a woman who is known for her charisma and cheerfulness, which are qualities that help her to hold on to customers.  In addition to her crops, she also sells firewood.  \"I have worked alone for many years since everything I do is for my son so that he lacks nothing and can finish his university studies,\" she says proudly.  One of her goals is to see her son develop as a person.  Later on she would like to strengthen her firewood business so that she can live peacefully.

Esta familia vive en su casa propia ubicada en una comunidad nativa en Chanchamayo.\n\nElla se dedica a la agricultura desde que era ni\u00f1a. Cuenta con dos parcelas de terreno donde siembra pl\u00e1tanos de tres variedades: isla, bellaco y largo.  As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, produce cacao en media parcela, \u201cCacao siembro hace a\u00f1os y s\u00ed me conviene porque cada kilo est\u00e1 ahora a 6 soles con 50 c\u00e9ntimos, pero hay meses en que llega a costar 11 soles\u201d, menciona. A pesar de la baja de precios, considera que \u00e9ste fruto es el que m\u00e1s satisfacciones le da. Su cosecha es una vez al a\u00f1o, mientras tanto se solventa con la venta de pl\u00e1tanos que recoge cada 20 d\u00edas.\nEl principal problema que encontr\u00f3 en todos estos a\u00f1os que lleva como mujer del campo es la falta de capital, por eso agradece el apoyo brindado.  Gracias al trabajo coordinado entre ella y su esposo, pueden cubrir las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de sus hijos.

Four of the children live with them and they are 15, 13, 10 and 8 years old. They live in the own home located in the native community of Chanchamayo.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in agriculture since she was a young girl. She has two parcels of land where she grows three varieties of bananas: Isla, Bellaco and lLargo. She also cultivates cacao on half a parcel. Susana says \"I have been growing cacao for years and it benefits me because each kilogram is being sold now for 6.50 soles but there are months that it increases to 11 soles\". Even though prices are lower, she considers this fruit to be the one that gives her the most satisfaction. Her harvest occurs once a year and meanwhile she makes money harvesting bananas every twenty days. \r\n\r\nThe main problem that she found in all these years, being a woman from the countryside, is the lack of capital. She is grateful for the support from MFP. Thanks to the coordinated efforts of her husband and herself, they can cover the basic necessities of their children. Susana is not a conformist and therefore wants to increase her cacao harvest and continue with agriculture because she has a good command of it and it gives her pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth credit with MFP. She is committed to making her payments on time, as she has done in the past. She belongs to the communal bank \"Los Pomporitos de San Crist\u00f3bal\" and she feels comfortable working with these responsible people. With the loan, she will be able to buy banana plants and plant them in the empty spaces of her parcels.

She sells the majority of her produce in the city, though once in a while buyers come to her own community.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to improve her produce, especially coffee - one of the best crops - and to thereby improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina's fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she mentions that she will be punctual with her repayments. She belongs to the \u201cLos Pomporitos de San Crist\u00f3bal\u201d Communal Bank and she identifies with the group to the point that she took on the responsibility of being the treasurer.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the requested money in the purchase of bags of fertilizer and to pay the people she hires to clean and fertilize her coffee crops, which are now in full harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1094748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and to pay laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-22T05:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-21T05:50:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":210.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":268.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":273.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":289.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":309.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":323.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":343.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":361.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":381.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":172.5,"local_amount":450.01,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":457.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098836},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":268.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":272.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401686},{"amount":104.95,"local_amount":273.79,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":278.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455969},{"amount":110.92,"local_amount":289.37,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":294.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451621},{"amount":118.47,"local_amount":309.05,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":314.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446804},{"amount":123.97,"local_amount":323.4,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":328.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187847},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":343.84,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":349.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571906},{"amount":284.6,"local_amount":742.44,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":754.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121687}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T22:23:13Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":428951,"name":"Jovita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovita is 62 years old and lives in Tinacla-an, Clarin.

There she has a general store where she sells various products that the neighborhood families need for their homes.  She also engages in the traditional trade of making clothes of all types.  Her business started when she was a teenager upon finishing her high school studies.  She enrolled with the National Learning Service (SENA), a technical education institution that is supported by the national government.  Elsida studied sewing and interned at various family-owned workshops.  From that point, she began promoting her products at a local market and started to gain many customers.  As a result of having all of these customers, she was able to earn income to support her family.  She continued on to successfully build her own workshop, which she still operates to this day.  Elsida also takes advantage of her usual customers by providing them additional services, such as extending credit to people who she trusts.  She gradually organized her general store to the point that she is able to sell a little bit of everything.  Her sewing business enables her to participate in trade events such as fairs, traveling craft exhibits, and other promotions.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe growth of Elsida's business is expected to continue, so she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy an industrial upright sewing machine so that she can continue improving her technique, make productive use of her time, and become more effective in her work each day.  At the same time, she will invest in fabrics in bulk so that she can obtain better prices.  Her goal is to upgrade her equipment since it is very old and has restricted her on several occasions.  Her greatest challenge is dealing with competitors who offer better prices, so she must respond by offering quality service in order to survive in the marketplace.

He is the father of a nineteen year old daughter and he lives in the southern part of the city, where he has own drink store. The store is part of a family tradition. His parents had a store where they sold basic retail goods and cold drinks. Later, his brother took over the business, which he eventually sold. This is how William took advantage of this strategic spot to start his own drink store. It is located in a high-traffic pedestrian area, which provides his business with a chance to grow. A year ago, William took out his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Mario Santo Domingo Foundation], which he used to make improvements to his business by cleaning up damp areas so that today he has a more comfortable environment for his customers. Among his next goals is fortifying his marketing strategy by opening a new sales point. He wants to take advantage of his experience to generate more sales and continue growing his business. Currently, he is requesting this Kiva loan, which will be his second loan with the Foundation, to purchase cases of beer, alcohol, and snacks so that he can prepare for one of his busiest times of the year, the month of May. May brings family and religious celebrations, which place a demand on his products. These demands, together with his experience, will make this investment very successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1092806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cases of beer, alcohol, and snacks.

She sells to all categories of people on a retail basis and works seven days a week from her home. Her major business challenges include stiff competition and ever increasing prices of bananas due to too much rain in the villages of Masaka. She is hoping to see her business grow so that she can start going to villages for bananas and also so she can build her own house.

It also has beautiful beaches and its residents are very kind.\r\n\r\nJulio works as a taxi driver and has been so doing for about 10 years.  His father taught him to drive and encouraged him to go into this type of business since he had a car and gave it to him so that he could work.  Julio gradually fixed the car with the fruits of his labor and he also supports his parents.  He believes that he does well in his business because he\u2019s very kind and because he very much wants to get ahead.\r\n\r\nJulio is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given him he will be able to service his vehicle, especially check out the engine, so that he\u2019ll have a car in good condition to work and provide security for his customers so that he can continue working toward making his greatest dream a reality: to give his children a good education and to buy a new car.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1094917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to service his vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-22T18:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-21T18:10:08Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Frankly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":211.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":215.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":224.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":235.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":242.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":253.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":261.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":271.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":285.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":293.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":305.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.74},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":428430,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The borrower has worked as a kindergarten teacher for many years.

She specializes in school uniforms and has gradually built up a clientele of educational institutions.  As a a result, she has earned recognition.  The idea for her business was conceived in 2010 when a friend convinced her to start her own business since had already acquired 20 years of experience working in various sewing factories.  Her main product lines include dresses, uniforms, school clothes, sportswear, and daily wear.  Her goal moving forward is to be well-structured so that she can generate better earnings and jobs for her children.  Her greatest challenge is not having sufficient operating capital to expand her business by purchasing tools and equipment since these items are becoming more sophisticated all the time.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to resolve this problem, Cleofelina is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy a sewing machine that will improve her production process and result in better-quality work, especially with dresses and uniforms.  This will make an impact on her market of existing customers and will help her to acquire new ones.  Her potential for success will rise as she gains more knowledge of the market, refines her technique, and improves her production times.  Higher quality in her finished products represents more money.

She has three children, one of whom is still in school. She and her husband earn a living by planting cassava on three hectares of farmland and selling Khmer noodles in the village. In addition, she supplements her income by working for others for pay. She has been in the Khmer noodle business for 10 years and the cassava business for 2 years. \r\n\r\nTouch's group comprises two female members who live in the same village and they both have been with VisionFund for two loan cycles already.

He is married and has six children who are all in school. He runs a mobile money transfer business in his hometown of Mongu, where he is fondly known as The Pioneer. He has been running this business since 2009 and It is his only source of income.\r\n\r\nHaving attended his primary, secondary and college education in three different provinces, he can speak five local languages. This, he says, will be invaluable as he goes about his expansion plan. Before he started running his mobile money transfers business, Mundia served his community as a police officer and worked with a local bank as a team sales leader.  He describes himself as persistent and hardworking. These qualities have helped him keep running his business.\r\n\r\nBeing one of the first people to start running a mobile money transfer business through Mobile Transactions Zambia (MTZ), Mundia has grown his business from scratch. He recalls that when he first started, he would only have five customers a day, which is a far cry from the 100+ who now transact with him on a daily basis.  He has since managed to employ four people who help him attend to customers.\r\n\r\nMundia believes that the Kiva loan will help him alleviate his major challenge of having low working capital. He would like to use the money to open more outlets in his province as he is convinced that more people are in need of sending and receiving money instantly and cheaply. His expanded business will help more members of the community access this service.\r\n\r\nHe has high hopes of becoming the biggest Mobile money agent in the western province.

She is a famer, and she grows maize and sorghum. She has a lot of experience in this field because she has been engaged in this activity for many years. She sows a very good farming land and she sells her products in the nearby. She can count on many good customers who know that Ana always sells high quality products at excellent prices; on top of this she is a very helpful and hardworking woman, and she likes facing new challenges because she loves her job. Thanks to her last harvest she succeeded in satisfying all of her customers\u2019 requests and she now wants to improve her production; but to do so she needs working capital, and for this reason she has asked INTEGRAL for a loan that will allow her to buy maize and sorghum seeds and fertilizers.

Vilma is a very hard-working, earnest woman who makes a living as a cacao, coffee, and fruit farmer. She began her work as a farmer 13 years ago, and she has much experience. During the harvest seasons, she hires additional laborers to harvest the crops on her land. After harvesting, she takes her crops to the collection center where she is paid per kilogram of produce. \r\n\r\nAccording to Vilma, the most rewarding part of her job is obtaining good harvests after lots of hard work. The most difficult part of her job, however, is transporting the heavy sacks of produce to the collection centers.

Elena's family is her disabled husband and 24 year-old son, Vyacheslav, who helps with the farming work.  She has problems with watering because it is very hard to water 40 sotkas of land at the same time.  This is why the family decided to purchase equipment for irrigation, which will increase the harvest-ability and ease human labor.  Elena's plans include expansion of her business, planting strawberries and potatoes and purchasing motorized equipment for plowing the soil.

His clients are locals or from the cities that come to him only to buy olive and make olive pickles and organic olive oil for their only use. Kindly note here, that Albanians consume large quantities of olive pickles and oil, therefore, the demand is high.

Anderson operates a retail store, where he sells household items such as sugar, salt, sodas, flour, cereals, and sweets. He has been involved in this business for three years. His store is located in a viable environment, and his primary customers are masons and local residents. \r\n\r\nNot only does Anderson sell household items, but he also sells trees for the construction of houses. He says his biggest business challenge is a shortage of household items to sell. He will use the Kes 100,000 loan to purchase household items for resale. Previously, Anderson took out three loans, which he has repaid. His business goal is to register his retail business so as to grow his sales within the next five years. He hopes that in the future, he will have helped to improve the living standard of his customers.

They live together in Santo Domingo which is the fourth most populous city in Ecuador after Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca (the most important cities of the country.) The population is growing rapidly because it has a rich trade and the largest cattle market in the country. Its normal temperature is 25.5 Celsius (80 Fahrenheit) and sometimes reaches 38 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit). All the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas forms part of the mountainous territory of the coast, of the western mountain range, historically known as Province of Yumbos and Capital de los Colibr\u00edes. It is located in the humid tropics of Latin America. It is considered a new province since it was created in 2007.\r\n\r\nThis entrepreneur began her business 5 years ago selling shoes door to door.  She works 6 hours daily traversing the streets of the city where she lives. It is hard work because she walks a lot with a backpack carrying her merchandise that is heavy. Diana wants to invest in merchandise since the sale of shoes requires an inventory of a variety of sizes and colors. For this reason she is resorting to a loan in order to invest in merchandise. With this she is hoping to have higher earnings and more sales. She dreams of having her own shoe store as she likes this work, and in the future to be able to give her children a home where they can live more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1095404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

providing a needed service to the community around him. A few years ago, he saw the need for more handicap accessible ramps in businesses and homes around him. Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, he sees his field as essential and one that will only become more necessary in the coming years. The ramps that his company builds are all customized to the building and built on location. This way every ramp fits in structurally and environmentally. To build these ramps in his area of Minnesota because of how spread out his contracts are, it is essential for him to have a truck to transport the parts to each site. However, recently he has been having problems with his truck. This loan would help him repair his truck so he can continue to provide for his customers within a vast area. Robert aspires to continue to build this business in the future with the hopes of employing more people and the ongoing goal of making his community handicap accessible for people with various disabilities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1089035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Ana is 62 years old and lives in the city of Barranquilla where she sells lunches and homemade food from her restaurant. She is separated with three children and has been involved with commercial activities since she was very young. \r\n\r\nBefore getting married, Ana worked in a municipality on the border of Colombia, where she worked for 22 years in a store and gained the majority of her business experience. With her current business she has been able to provide her children with an education and bring them ahead in life. She acquired two homes and thus addressed her biggest challenges before moving to Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nIn Barranquilla Ana has had various businesses, including selling stuffed arepas in a busy pedestrian area. She worked this business during night hours and in rough weather, and in addition it was located very far from her home so she wore herself out and decided to change activity. She rented a space where she began selling lunches, and she is still there two years later. \r\n\r\nAna's main customers are taxi drivers, masons, and passersby. She has one employee whom she pays daily. Ana works from very early in the morning until 3 pm and sells every day for cash. Her business infrastructure is made up of an industrial stove, six sets of tables, a fridge, and metal shelving. \r\n\r\nAnna is applying for her first Kiva loan, which is also her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan she will purchase in bulk ingredients such as rice, grains, sugar, and meat for making lunches. This loan will be a success because through buying in bulk, Ana will be able to reduce her costs and thus be more competitive in the market.

In the future, Bhuma plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1101575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-05-23T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-22T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286992353},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-24T08:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646239},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-04T08:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226914},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-24T10:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489464},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094441},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200677},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340415814},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170940},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913163},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624142},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020144}],"funded_date":"2012-05-23T06:26:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":429526,"name":"Candelaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Candelaria is married with 2 children.

She has been in this business for 33 years. She manages to make an income of around 53,000 KHR per day from her current business to support her big family and she  is able to save around 30,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is Sokha's first loan with Kiva's partner, VisionFund.

Her daughter is her motivation for living, as well as her husband's.  Yira has her own business in which she sells various merchandise such as comforters, women's clothing, sporting goods, and other items.  Yira completed her high school education early.  At the age 16, she began her technical career as an entry-level bank employee.  She was able to transfer her knowledge into a job for a private company.  Two years later, she decided to help her husband with his business in the retail sector.  Yira also started her own line of businesses selling detailed items to a customer base that has gradually increased.  At the moment, her goal to keep growing has not stopped and neither has the growth of her clientele.  However, her operating capital is not sufficient for supporting her dream of obtaining more customers.  For this reason, Yira is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy comforters, shoes, household decor products, women's accessories, and other affordable items.  These items will be purchased in a city along the Colombian border.  \r\n<p>\r\nAfter being adjusted according to the type of business she operates, Yira's financial indicators shows that her accounts receivable period is 16 days, her product rotation period is 7 days, and her sales profitability is no less than 30%.  Due to these financial reasons, it is projected that the investment of her Kiva loan will result in successful growth.
