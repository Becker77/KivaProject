This is a very important source of living for her family.\r\n\r\nHer business is good enough to cover her family's expenses and nothing more, so that's why Fatima applied for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to increase her merchandise to increase her business production, which will lead to an increase in her family's income and will improve their social and financial situations at the same time.\r\n\r\nFatima's customers are neighbors, villagers and relatives.

Mongolia. She lives with her parents-in-law and her husband and two children in her new house. Her husband plants vegetables in their backyard for their private use. She and her husband built a new house in 2010 and some decoration and building parts still have not been completed due to the lack of funding. Previously, they used to live in a ger, a Mongolian traditional nomadic tent. Usually a ger is cold and uncomfortable to live in for big families. \r\n\r\nOtgonjargal needs a loan to buy a heated-floor rather than using one of the smoky and harmful coal furnaces. These cost too much, especially in winter time. Coal usage creates a lot of air pollution and is toxic to the air in the cities of Mongolia. In last several years, air pollution and air quality has become one of the biggest issues in most Mongolian households and big cities. \r\n\r\nOtgonjargal is also planning to use some part of her loan to increase the groceries in her grocery store. This will expand her sales volume and increase her business earnings.

She hopes this loan will enable her to make more money so that she can have enough to finance her children's education until they finish school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1101898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seedlings and fertilizers for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-05-23T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-22T17:20:08Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Danak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vita","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288452},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1001750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265520},{"amount":550,"local_amount":2200000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2203850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841096}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T01:15:08Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":429774,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti is a 50 year old woman with five children, three of whom are in school while the other two are over school age.

What she likes about her work is that she has time available to do other things at home, because she only sells at particular times of the school day (when kids are going in or coming out of school, and during recesses). Additionally, she has a store at home where she sells groceries with her mother's help. Things are going very well and she hopes to be able to continue what she has been doing so far. \r\n\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she can count on financial support to move forward with her business.

She is married to Wilfredo, a driver. Sarah is a mother of one child. By the grace of God, Sarah has managed to support her child's schooling up to college level, a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Sarah. Since Sarah herself has been an undergraduate, she believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\nSarah operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nSarah dreams of being able to see her child finish college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1101799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-23T18:40:55Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-22T18:40:55Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2167.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095758},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359374},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303189},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355913}],"funded_date":"2012-05-23T19:58:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":426362,"name":"Oscar Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar tiene 45 a\u00f1os pero es un joven de 20 a\u00f1os en esp\u00edritu y alegr\u00eda, vive al lado de su esposa y sus 2 hijos de 14 y 2 a\u00f1os, a quienes ama much\u00edsimo y por quienes se esfuerza mucho para sacarlos adelante y tenga un futuro mejor , su vivienda se ubica en la ciudad de Pisco, ciudad que se caracteriza por ciudad que se caracteriza por tener un clima c\u00e1lido, asimismo hermosas playas y tambi\u00e9n tiene a las Islas Ballestas, las cuales son visitadas por infinidad de turistas en todo el a\u00f1o.

They sold dairy products and cattle in small cities and villages around their living location. Unfortunately, this past winter, the snow and extreme cold hit North Albania very harsh and thousands of animals died including Dilore's cows. \nThe demand for dairy products is high throughout Albania, thus, like many others who are involved in the same business, they were fortunate enough to generate some income through it. With that money they were able to feed the children and build a house and improve living conditions. When Dilore started describing the living conditions they were in before, she became very emotional.\nNow, she plans to add three more cows to the once they already have and build a little stable so that animals no longer live outside during the cold and snowy winters. This is the fourth time that Dilore is applying for a loan.

They welcome tourists with open arms and introduce them to their marvelous culture and environment.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Gloria opened an office supply store which carries some other miscellaneous items.  She is open everyday for 8 hours and has her daughter's help.  This last year has gone well for her, and the income from the store has allowed her to have a modest lifestyle.  Despite occasional shortages, she and her daughter have learned to keep moving forward.  Because the primary and secondary schools in the coastal region are starting up, Gloria has decided to invest in school supplies.  There is a lot of demand for them, especially at this time.  This enterprising woman will make use of the loan to purchase merchandise for her store and to therefore have a better income which will allow her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nLife has not been easy for this woman.  It is difficult to raise a daughter alone.  Even though she owns her own home, Gloria hopes to fix it up to give her daughter a more comfortable life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1096347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

His work schedule is very demanding, however, leaving him very little time to cook for them and help with household chores. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to pay back the loan very quickly and, with each payment, improve their quality of lie. This is his first loan with FUDECOSUR, and he has not had loans before with state-run banks either. He decided on FUDECOSUR for this loan because of their lower interest rates and better client support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1096438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

is 47 years old. He is married and lives with his family: his wife, Olja, two daughters (19 and 17 years old), and an 8-year-old son. His eldest daughter is a student, and their son goes to school. The family has one hectare of land. Lado and Olja grow potatoes on their land and sell the harvest locally to retailers. The main source of the income for the family used to be a truck owned by Lado. He was busy with the transportation of various goods and worked when he had orders. Recently, the truck got out of order, and Lado had to stop his operations. Right now, the total average monthly income for the family is 300 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the substantially poor category. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Lado\u2019s truck is out of order and needs a serious renovation. He has requested a credit for purchasing spare parts for his truck. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. With the received credit, Lado will purchase spare parts for his truck and change the damaged ones. Afterwards, Lado will be able to re-start his transportation service and receive income, which will then be used for financing the education of his children as well as improving the living conditions for his family. The income of the family will increase by 300 \u2013 400 Laris, which will mean a 100% \u2013 125% increase. In addition to the above mentioned, the family will have enough income to access regular credit products that are available on the country\u2019s capital market in case they need them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1102149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

She lives in a small village of Akhaltsikhe District, South Georgia. Malula lives with her family: her husband, Tariel, two adult daughters (who are 20 and 17 years old), and a 2-year-old son. Malula\u2019s eldest daughter is a student, and the younger daughter goes to school. Malula is busy with her trade business. She purchases dairy products, haricots, as well as other vegetables from local farmers and sells them in Tbilisi (the capital city of Georgia). She goes to Tbilisi every weekend. The total average monthly income of the family is 600 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the substantially poor category.\r\n\r\nMalula has requested a credit for starting up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low-income status. With the received credit Malula will start up a dairy farm. She will purchase two cows. The cows will be placed in an old cattle shed located in Malula\u2019s yard. She will produce, on average, 40 kg of cheese each month and sell the produced cheese in Tbilisi together with other products that she sells. The income of the family will increase by 300 - 400 Laris, which will mean a 50% \u2013 60% increase. The living conditions of the family will significantly improve. Malula will be able to finance the education of her younger daughter and provide better care for her little son. In addition to the above mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1102198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

He began his business more than 4 years ago and so far has had the help of his partner who sells from home. He considers his business profitable enough for the earnings it gives him, as he is able to sell all the chickens he buys.

Her partner is Richard and he is the father of their three children: Hill, age 16, Claus, age 15, and Yadira, age 13. Together they live in their own home. \r\n\r\nIsabel works selling clothing and shoes, which she does by making monthly trips to the capital to look for and buy the best styles at the best prices. She started this business more than six years ago, and she considers it worthwhile due to the profit she makes - with which she can pay for household expenses and her daughter's education. This is her way of supporting her partner and getting ahead together as a family. Previously they had financial troubles, and her partner's income wasn't enough to cover all the expenses of groceries, clothing, and others. But since she's begun to work she's been very satisfied with her business. She has plans to grow the business and open a boutique in her home. \r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's third loan with MFP. She says that she's very happy with her community bank, and considers it a united and supportive group. With the requested amount of 1200 PEN, she will purchase more clothing and shoes brought from the capital.

He is an honest, a hard-working, and most of all, a responsible man. He lives with his wife in his mother-in-law's house, along with his thirteen-year old son whom they have raised together and for whom they want to provide a good education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis job consists of transporting passengers and sometimes some cargo in and out of the city on his motorcycle. He leaves very early in the morning in search of his eventual passengers, who wait needing to be transported from one place to the other. He has been working this way for thirteen years and supplements his profession with this job. He is a teacher at a primary school in the city.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his job is that he is able to accomplish two activities at the same time, in that after he finishes his classes, he heads out again to look for passengers. This is going well for him, since he generates twice the income for his family. He hopes to be able to continue as he has up to this point, and in the future to buy another motorcycle and work with a chauffeur.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP. He is very content to know that he will have some financial support, as this way he will feel more secure going forward with his business. On the other side, he promises once again to comply with the payment of his debts in a punctual way as he does not want to disappoint the other group members, who are very punctual.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount\u20141200 PEN\u2014he will buy parts for the refurbishment of his vehicle. He will buy a tarpaulin, some tires, and will pay the mechanic who will do all the restoration work on the motorcycle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1096661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair his motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-24T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-23T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":206.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":214.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.94,"local_amount":175.83,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":175.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203141},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":202.6,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":202.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098880},{"amount":67.85,"local_amount":180.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":181.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401729},{"amount":77.42,"local_amount":206.45,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":206.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456012},{"amount":80.31,"local_amount":214.16,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":214.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451660},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":220.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446846}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T00:34:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Kremer","image":null}},{"id":426833,"name":"Ela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ela tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena y amable.

She plans on using the loan to buy another computer and printer for the cafe. Her business strategy is to buy quality and modern computer equipment to attract customers.

He is married and has two children who are adults and live independently.  He is also a grandfather with a 16-year-old granddaughter who lives with him and depends on him and his wife for a good education and upbringing.

He has been in business for eight years; and it took much effort to get started, as he was not accustomed to this type of work and had health problems (kidneys).  Over time he figured out how to do his job better and now he is an expert.  What he enjoys about his work is that he can manage his own schedule and take whatever time off he needs.  He also has a means of transport for the family.  He does not feel any pressure carrying out his activity although business is not at its best because demand is down.  But he is thinking about opening a grocery store in his home for extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is his eighth loan through MFP.  He is happy about the financial support and is sure this will help him advance in his work.  Also, he is committed to paying it back on time as with his previous loans.

She mainly offers curtains, bed sheets, blankets and other home trappings. Seasonal demands for clothing like uniforms and such are available all year round. She also does repairs and alterations. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 330 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nJocelyn dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

","en":"Raisa is a farmer from Ukraine.  She started her work as an agronomist at an agricultural collective and is now involved in farming together with her family on privatized land.  She planted areas of cherries and apricots and is also involved in growing grapes and vegetables (tomatoes and cucumbers).  Lately, following her the death of her husband, who was the primary farm-work helper, it became difficult for Raisa to work alone.  Of course, the children help her, but only in their free time.  Her 23 year-old son works as a firefighter after graduating from the Agrotechnological Academy, and the 17 year-old daughter studies to become an artist-decorator in Kulprosvet.  The family of her late husband help Raisa with the business as well.  \r\nIt is difficult for the family to work on ten hectares of land, and this is why it is necessary to hire workers.  Unfortunately, the family does not have such means.  A purchase of farming machinery would significantly speed up the process of preparing the soil for sowing plants and reduce the number of weeds.  Raisa needs help and in the future dreams of building a greenhouse for planting strawberries, buying a sprayer - a very important thing in the farming business.  She wants to help agricultural businesses of Ukraine to grow and flourish by developing her farm!  She needs your help with financing farming machinery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1095966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Patricia lives in a rented house along with her husband and her 2 minor children, for whom she works hard to offer a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nPatricia sells hardware. She has a hardware store located in the center of the city, in a much traveled zone. Patricia has had the business for 9 months and she enjoys the backing and help of her husband, with whom she works. Like all new businesses, it is still entering the market and she hopes to be able to grow, little by little. What she likes most about her work is being beside her husband, because they get along well. The business is doing well; it grows daily, not as much as they would like, but at least they are making sufficient profits. She hope to consolidate the business and grow much more as a hardware business person. \r\n\r\nThis is Patricia's 3rd loan with MFP, and she hopes to continue with her objectives. And in addition, Patricia promises, once more, to comply with her payment schedule, as in her earlier loans.

Although it was difficult at first to acquire customers based on effort and much sacrifice added to the good service and tasty dishes, she eventually succeeded.

She plants and tends them for a month then sells them to the reseller, up to hundreds of mango seedlings a year. The income from selling the seedlings has been used to cover her household expenses and the educational expenses of her children. In addition, Sofira plans to add more varieties of mango seedlings. To implementing her dream, Sofira submitted a loan application and requested a loan of IDR 10,000,000 from TLM to purchase seedlings, pesticide and fertilizer. Sofira really hopes that her dream will come true because of the loan assistance.

She earns a minimum of Php 380 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCarmen hopes to be able to expand soon.
