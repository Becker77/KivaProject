All of her life, she has demonstrated that she is a very determined woman.  As a single mother, she must raise her two children alone.  They are 17 and 12 years of age.  Most of what they achieved to this point is attributed to having a mother who works in order to provide them the best.  \r\n<p>\r\nDeysi raises poultry in a large space in her home that is well-suited.  She raises approximately 100 chickens at a time, starting at the stage when they are newly hatched.  Deysi keeps them for an average of 45 days.  When the chickens are ready to be sold, she takes them to the central market in the city.  Deysi has good customers who are always expected to buy from her since her chickens are good as a result of being raised on a balanced diet.  She has been in this business for six years and enjoys it because it enables her to make use of her time.  At first she had many problems, such as not knowing the complete process for raising chickens or that she had to vaccinate each bird.  Now she is a total expert and is improving her process each day. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 15th loan with MFP and she is pleased to know that she has financial support.  Deysi feels confident that she can advance her business.  Once again, just like her previous loans, she promises to complete her payments.  Deysi also says that she is happy with her group.  She is a long-time member who shows the new members how to work as a team and act in a responsible manner, and everyone does.  The loan amount of 1,000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy baby chicks that she can begin raising.  She will also buy balanced feed, a few vitamins, and necessary vaccines for good development.

She has had a general store in the same town for 12 years. Here she sells various goods on a daily basis and also sells items such as clothes, shorts, and cooking utensils to order, taking payment weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. Her clients identify her and recommend her, and so the business has projected increasing sales. Her customers recognize that they can find and buy many of their necessities in her store. But, Gladis has some items that rotate through her store much more quickly than others, and she has a total inventory rotation of 63 days. This is why she came to Kiva to get her first loan through Foundation Maro Santo Domingo with which she will buy women's and children's clothes and small electrical appliances - items that sell quickly and make a good profit. Her long-term goal is to have her own house to improve the wellbeing of her family as her children's needs increase as they get older. Meanwhile, she wants to get her business inventory rotation to 47 days as this is a financial indicator from which we project growth. \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1097450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy women's and children's clothing and small electrical appliances.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. Most Filipino parents, like Alma, as she herself has been a college undergraduate, believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAlma maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are relying on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also has a farm. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAlma dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1102794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

In her workshop, she also sells the fabric to her clients so she doesn't have to wait for them to bring the fabric themselves.

He has dedicated much of his life to providing the best for his family and improving their quality of life.  His work consists of buying dry goods, such as corn and beans.  The corn is processed so that it can be sold as chicken feed.  He has a small grain mill that he shares with a friend and another member.  They work and sell at the central market of the city and at various posts within the city.  Edinson has been in this line of work for four years and it has allowed him to become independent and earn income.  What he enjoys about his work is always having time available and taking pleasure in being able to walk around the entire city.  He is doing well and earns an average return of 15% from his investment, which is then reinvested every three days.  Like all young entrepreneurs, Edinson wants to have his own shop where he can process his goods himself and generate more income.  For now, he is accumulating the capital he needs so that he can continue investing in what he has.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Once again, just as he did with his previous loans, he promises to complete his loan payments.  Edinson is also grateful to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.  The amount of 2,000 PEN that he requested will be used to buy more corn kernels so that he can continue his processing business.  He will also acquire beans that he can sell in bulk.

A Philippine tricycle  is made by mounting a sidecar to a regular motorbike. They are used mainly to ferry passengers short distances along smaller, more residential streets, often too or from jeepneys or other public utility vehicles. They are also used for transporting cargo too heavy to carry by hand and over a distance too short or roads too congested for motor transport. During the rainy season, tricycles are useful as a way to avoid walking through floodwaters. Along with the jeepney, the motorized tricycle and the engine-powered kuliglig, the open-air pedicab provides shade when needed.\r\n\r\n<p>To help her continue operations of her business, Ivy is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan in order to buy new bikes to be attached to the pedicabs. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\n<p>Ivy dreams of being able to buy the bikes. She also dreams that her children will finish their education.

One is making and selling baby clothing by order. The other is selling infant footwear that she buys in the city or orders from samples from the catalogs and distributes to stores throughout the north coast of the country. Alix has received 4 loans from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation which have helped her to increase her market and her organizational structure. She initially had a very local market and has been able to expand to other regions of the country. Her goal for the future is to have a bar code and sell internationally, initially in neighboring countries until she expands further. Her greatest challenge is competition and the duration of her travels, which allow her to shore up her customer base and increase her sales volume. \r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for her 5th loan which she will use to buy fabric, lace, elastic, infant footwear and general materials. She wants to get them at the special discounts that her suppliers give when she buys in bulk and in cash. This is exactly the reason that her investment will be successful. She will make baby clothing and buy footwear, which she will add value to with her design techniques and finishing touches.

Also, he plans to buy 1 hectare of land where he hopes to grow vegetables and fruits. As a result of the above-mentioned investment, the income of the family will increase.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and  as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1101553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286992355},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-24T08:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5235.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646241},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-04T08:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226916},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-24T10:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489466},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094443},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200679},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340415816},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170942},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913165},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624144},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020146}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T16:12:01Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":430547,"name":"Lucresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucresia is 63 years old and married.

The members are originally from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, which is \"\u00d1uu Oko\" in Mixtec.  Pinotepa is derived from the words \"pinoli\" meaning \"crumbled house, dust\"; \"teptl\" meaning \"hill\", and \"pan\" meaning \"toward\".  Therefore, the literal meaning is \"to turn the hill into dust.\"\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the group is Sra. Francisca Rocio.  She is 23 years old and is better known as \"Rocio\".  She is a friendly and humble woman.  Rocio has been selling cosmetics and perfumes from the Avon line for three years.  She goes to the subdivisions within her community to offer her merchandise by going house-to-house with a smile and providing good service to everyone.  Rocio started this business thanks to a neighbor and friend who recommended that she sell these types of products since this would be a profitable business and provide her with the opportunity to manage her time.  To this day, she is pleased with the results she has achieved.  Rocio mentions that she works every day with great dedication.  One of the things that she does not like is collecting payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nRocio is happily married to Sr. Juan Carlos and they have two children, Sa\u00fal Daniel y Pedro Pablo, who are their greatest treasures.  One of her dreams is to begin selling shoes on the recommendation of one of her customers who said that these products are purchased frequently.  Rocio is requesting a loan in order to buy more cosmetics and perfumes.  She thanks Vision Fund for helping her and, above all, caring about her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThe other members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022 Regina Eugenia sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022 Josefa Francisca sells clothing.\r\n\u2022 Ricarda sells fruit drinks.\r\n\u2022 Erika Cecilia sells clothing.\r\n\u2022 Susana sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022 Esther sells candy.\r\n\u2022 Lucia sells snacks.  \r\n\u2022 Minerva Adelfa sells Mexican street food.  \r\n\u2022 Catalina sells perfumes.\r\n\u2022 Julieta Domings sells candy.\r\n\u2022 Prisciliana sells desserts.\r\n\u2022 Maria Isabel sells cheese.\r\n\u2022 Lucia del Carmen sells meat.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are grateful to the FRAC organization for helping them improve their lives and provide a better life for their families.

He also plans to set up pipes to provide water to rooms such as the bathroom, the shower, and the kitchen. This is important because the water tankers only come once a week, and often his family is without water, which is a necessary element in every home.

El nombre del grupo lo eligi\u00f3 una persona que finalmente decidi\u00f3 salir de la asociaci\u00f3n, esta persona se dedicaba a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bordados, de all\u00ed el nombre (por los bordados que elaboraba la se\u00f1ora Vicenta y porque pertenecen a una zona mazahua). Do\u00f1a Soledad nos cuenta que tiene 59 a\u00f1os ya es una mujer viuda ya que su esposo desafortunadamente hace poco muri\u00f3. Ella se dedica la cr\u00eda y venta de animales como pollos y borregos, en la actividad lleva ya 31 a\u00f1os y la inici\u00f3 porque quer\u00eda ayudar a su esposo a solventar los gastos del hogar como educaci\u00f3n, alimentos, zapatos, etc. La dificultad m\u00e1s grande que presenta Do\u00f1a Soledad es la falta de alimento para comprar zacate y ma\u00edz, ya que los precios de estos productos est\u00e1n muy caros debido a la sequia y la falta de lluvias para obtener una buena cosecha de dichos productos. Do\u00f1a Soledad comenta que una vez tuvo que sacar sus ahorros del banco para poder comprarles alimento a sus animales, aun as\u00ed esto no la desanima en nada ya que su meta es comprar un becerro para tener un ahorro en casa. Aunque le va muy bien con las ventas, desea tener un becerro. Explica tambi\u00e9n, que las veces que ha estado dentro de un cr\u00e9dito le ha ayudado mucho, pues puede comprar zacate, ma\u00edz y alimento, pero tambi\u00e9n cuando vende, sus ganancias las utiliza para comprar comida, calzado y ropa para ella y para una hija que a\u00fan depende de ella.

All of them live in the community of San Pablo Tlachichilpa where the residents engage in agriculture.  In addition, this region is a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mazahua_language\" target=\"_blank\" >Mazahua<\/a> area.  The name was chosen by a person who finally decided to leave the group.  This person produced embroideries, therefore the name was created (for the \"bordados\" [embroideries] produced by Sra. Vicenta and because she is from a Mazahua area).  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Soledad says that she is 59 years old.  Unfortunately, she is already a widow since her husband died a short time ago.  She raises and sells animals, such as chickens and sheep.  Do\u00f1a Soledad has been in this business for 31 years and began working because she wanted to help her husband cover the household expenses such as education, food, shoes, and other needs.  Her greatest difficulty is the lack of feed, such as fodder and corn, since these products are very expensive due to drought and the lack of rain required to achieve a good crop harvest.  Do\u00f1a Soledad says that one time she had to withdraw her savings from the bank in order to buy feed for her animals.  However, this did not discourage her at all since her goal is to buy a calf that she can keep at her house.  Even though her sales have done very well, she still wants a calf.  She also explains that a loan has been a great help to her on several occasions when buying fodder, corn, and feed.  When she sells, her profits are used to buy food, shoes, and clothing for herself and her daughter who is still dependent on her.  \r\n<p>\r\nRegarding the other members, they will invest in their respective business activities:\r\n\u2022 Olivia and Juliana will buy chickens.\r\n\u2022 Don Mario, the only man in the group, will buy sheep.

She started this business approximately five years ago with her husband, who is the cook, and with the use of a bank loan.  Rosa enjoys her work because it enables her to earn an income for covering the household expenses.  She had many financial needs and her husband was earning a low salary when he worked as a cook at another restaurant.  Now she feels very relieved to have her own business.  Rosa also has plans for expansion so that she can accommodate more customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP organization.

Alondra makes a living selling animal and pet food, and also has a general store, which she established about two years ago. She operates her business from her home, and she works Monday through Sunday, from 11:00 am until 9:00 pm. She purchases her merchandise directly from distributors from whom she can hopefully receive lower prices. With the support from this loan, she plans to purchase merchandise for her general store. One of her goals is to grow her business and eventually add office machines, such as a photocopy machine, a hole-punch machine, and a laminating machine. \r\n\r\nAlondra lives with her husband and their two children, ages 18 and 11. Her oldest son is studying in a university, and his dream is to one day have a successful business to generate good income and have a better quality of life. Alondra is grateful for the opportunity given her by Fondo Esperanza, and she is happy to be a member of the Community Bank, as she feels connected to the group and motivated to continue her participation in the institution. \r\n\r\nTalcahuano is a community and city-port in the Biob\u00edo region in the south of Chile. It is known for being one of the main ports in the country. Its name in the Mapuche tongue is Mapudungun, which means thundering sky. The region has naturally beautiful geography, since it is made up of a combination of sea coast and inlets, rivers, fertile plains, meadows and mountains, and has beautiful plants and vegetation. Its economy is based on the port, as well as the Navy Base and an important industrial neighborhood that houses steel factories, oil refineries, petro-chemistry facilities, cement plants, gas plants, etc.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1097692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talcahuano","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T18:00:08Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alondra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":480962,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25527},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":28394},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28665},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":28395},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":29714},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":29493},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29774},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30058},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":30345},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30334},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":31184},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31005},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":31692},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31820},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":32124},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32438}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":285.22,"local_amount":140695,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":142693.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283324323},{"amount":242.59,"local_amount":119670,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":121369.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430172},{"amount":316.31,"local_amount":156035,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":158250.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332947},{"amount":130.88,"local_amount":64562,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":65478.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878970}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T20:20:39Z","paid_date":"2012-09-18T08:21:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":430587,"name":"Rhoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhoda works hard to support her family.

He is a good and friendly man who works hard in order to provide his family with a better life.  He is married with three children, aged 5, 9 and 12.  They are his reason of living and for all his hard work and effort.  He lives in his own house, which he was able to buy with a great deal of sacrifice together with his wife.\r\n\r\nHis job is to transport cargo and passengers to and from the city in his three-wheeled motorcycle.  At first he rented a motorcycle for this purpose, but he was working a lot and making little money, since the majority of his earnings went toward the rent of his vehicle.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this work for more than twenty years, and is very happy to have achieved a lot of things, such as stability for his family and being able to give an education to his children.  Things are going well, as he has the advantage of having two sources of income; he also works as a weightlifting instructor in the Peruvian institute of sports.  He has many plans for the future and has decided to work hard in order to achieve them; one of these goals is to buy a second motorcycle.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP, which he hopes will help him continue to make progress toward his goals.

He makes a living as a corn farmer, and has much experience from his years of harvesting and working. He plants high quality seeds, sells his produce at reasonable prices, and tries to give his customers what they want. \r\n\r\nNapole\u00f3n is a hard-working, honest and determined man. One of his dreams is to grow his business, and even though he has had to endure poor harvests, he still works as hard as he can to be the best farmer in the area.

She is married to Arbi, a mechanic. She has three children, two of whom are in college and one in high school. Together with her husband and children, she manages the household while working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nLorna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store, or sari-sari, is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP\u2019s worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Lorna profits by buying supplies at wholesale, then selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nLorna also operates a beauty parlor where customers can have their hair styled or nails done. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Lorna also does direct sales. She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP every day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations, Lorna is requesting a 37,000 PHP loan from CCT to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her sari-sari\u2019s inventory. She will also use a part of the loan to buy a hair dryer, a foot spa, a hydraulic chair, and other hair treatments.

Cabe mencionar que aunque ahora sus hijos colaboran con los gastos del hogar, no quiere dejar a un lado su negocio, ya que ella es una mujer trabajadora la cual a pesar de sus 67 a\u00f1os, no se cansa de trabajar y no ha pensado dejar de recibir los ingresos de su bazar. Solicita este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en la compra de mercader\u00eda como: variedad de juguetes, ropa para bebes, cuadernos, l\u00e1pices, lapiceros, pega, papel, etc. Con lo cual sue\u00f1a darle un impulso a su negocio y continuar recibiendo los beneficios que hasta el momento le han ayudado a sacar adelante a su familia. \n","en":"Jes\u00fas has worked all her life to be able to take care of her family. She lives with her two daughters and her son. Thanks to the support and upbringing which she has given her children, all three are now hardworking people who work hard to alleviate the economic situation which becomes ever more difficult. In view of the fact that the economic situation was so difficult and that she had been the sole breadwinner for a long time, she decided many years ago to start up a small bazaar in her home, where she sells a variety of items such as stationery, toys, baby clothes, etc. This has been her main source of income which has allowed her to feed her family every day for many years. Despite the fact that her children now contribute to the household expenses she doesn't want to give up her business, as she is a hardworking woman who in spite of her 67 years does not tire of working and who has not considered giving up the income from her bazaar. She is requesting this loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying merchandise such as a variety of toys, baby clothes, notebooks, pencils, pens, glue, paper, etc. With this, she hopes to boost her business and continue making the profits which have helped her to support her family until now.

The youngest child is in school. Etbel works in running a grocery store and she has been doing this for 18 and a half years. Thanks to God and her hard work, she has been able to sustain this activity and this is what enables her to put bread on the table every day as her husband's income is not enough to pay for the main necessities, which are always becoming more expensive. She is well known in the area as she always offers quality products and good prices. For her, the most important thing is that her customers are satisfied with her service. Regarding the stability of her business, she has a big advantage as there is no real competition because she has become one of the preferred stores in the area as the store is well supplied and people can get good service there as well as a variety of products in good condition. Lately she has been noting that the demand for her products is increasing and she is often left with a scarcity of goods. This has led her to take the decision to request a loan from Integral to invest in her business by buying supplies (beans, sugar, rice, candy, bread, oil, shampoo, soap, paper, etc.) that will enable her to meet a greater demand and, in this way, she hopes to make better profits that will enable here to improve the quality of life for her and her family.

Todos los d\u00edas se levanta  muy temprano para ocuparse de las tareas del hogar y luego trasladarse para el lugar donde vende sus billetes de loter\u00eda. Se establece en un lugar muy concurrido en el cual ya logro ganarse la confianza de muchas personas, raz\u00f3n por la cual ya cuenta con clientela que continuamente la buscan para demandar los billetes de loter\u00eda. Con los ingresos que percibe de esta actividad y  de los pocos ingresos  recibidos por su esposo en el oficio de fontaner\u00eda, han logrado sacar adelante a su familia. Aunque ahora sus  hijos ya est\u00e1n trabajando y colaboran en el hogar, no quieren quedarse de brazos cruzados, sin hacer nada. Ellos son personas trabajadoras que les gusta salir adelante por medio de sus propios esfuerzos. Esta raz\u00f3n ha llevado a la se\u00f1ora Yanira a presentarse a esta instituci\u00f3n para solicitar este cr\u00e9dito el cual le permita adquirir un n\u00famero mayor de billetes de loter\u00eda para incrementar la oferta y poder lograr incrementar las ventas as\u00ed como los ingresos. De esta forma espera mejorar su condici\u00f3n de vida y la de su familia. \n","en":"44 year old Yanira Guadalupe lives with her family group, which is comprised of her husband and 3 children. Thanks to the education that she has, with much dedication, given to her children, they have already found work and they help a little with the household expenses. Yanira has been selling lottery tickets for 11 years. Every morning, she gets up very early to do the housework and later she goes to the place where she sells lottery tickets. She has a location that is very busy and she has won the confidence of many people and so she has customers who always look for her to buy lottery tickets. With the income that she gets from this work, and with the little income received by her husband as a plumber, they have been able to bring up their family. Although her children are now in work and help at home, they don't want to sit with their arms crossed, not doing anything. They are hardworking people who like to succeed through their own efforts.

She has taken the decision to invest in her business and this is why she needs the loan which she is requesting from the institution Integral. The loan will be used to buy raw materials (flour, sugar, eggs, coloring, milk, cinnamon, etc.) for making the delicious bread that her customers demand every day. She is confident that she will have favorable results that will enable her to have a better quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1097787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy: flour, sugar, eggs, coloring, milk, cinnamon, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-25T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-24T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.95,"local_amount":72.95,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049724},{"amount":80.31,"local_amount":80.31,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521358},{"amount":85.58,"local_amount":85.58,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329970},{"amount":127.95,"local_amount":127.95,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":127.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321150},{"amount":133.21,"local_amount":133.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":133.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929719}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T00:07:36Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":430644,"name":"Pamela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela is 40 years of age.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Myrna earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to purchase some necessities for her water station. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMyrna hopes to be able to expand soon, and be able to settle all her financial obligations.

This is the reason that she decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL, since she does not have the funds herself to be able to make an investment in her business to buy clothing like: skirts, blouses, pants, under garments, shorts, etc. She is confident that with the help of this institution, she will reach her goal of improving her and her family's quality of life.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1097813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy skirts, blouses, pants, under garments, shorts, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-26T03:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-25T03:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":23.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":26.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.17,"local_amount":21.17,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":21.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049733},{"amount":22.33,"local_amount":22.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":22.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521367},{"amount":22.63,"local_amount":22.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":22.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329979},{"amount":23.92,"local_amount":23.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":23.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349793},{"amount":24.21,"local_amount":24.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":24.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321158},{"amount":26.34,"local_amount":26.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":26.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929728},{"amount":26.13,"local_amount":26.13,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":26.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331924880},{"amount":83.27,"local_amount":83.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":83.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846016}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T18:56:04Z","paid_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Kell","image":809712}},{"id":430752,"name":"Sokchheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokchheng is 34 years old and married with one boy and one girl who are both still in school.
