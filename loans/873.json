His ambition is to turn his caf\u00e9 into a world class hotel in the near future, and he believes that the additional income made possible by this loan will help him improve his family\u2019s living standards.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1104508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic and arm chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Likoni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-05-26T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-25T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1430},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1420}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.82,"local_amount":10384,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287632811},{"amount":102.35,"local_amount":8584,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8710.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294404879},{"amount":148.83,"local_amount":12482,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12665.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301459314}],"funded_date":"2012-06-14T14:06:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:59:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":427873,"name":"Horacio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Horacio un hombre corpulento y bien parecido, que vive en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, lugar ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe, afirma de manera jocosa, como la cultura de los habitantes de esta tierra, que un embutido preparado por \u00e9l,  tiene \u201cefectos  que activan la imaginaci\u00f3n \u201d y  la gente no puede dejar de sonre\u00edr al escucharlo. Su negocio tiene mucha acogida en el mercado, en el cual es reconocido por su car\u00e1cter agradable y muy Caribe. Horacio tiene su propio negocio, con su esposa con la cual trabaja, vendiendo morcillas, (embutido preparado con arroz, sangre de cerdo, y verdura) arepas, empanadas, cervezas, gaseosas, y v\u00edveres en general; en su negocio a esta pareja, le ha ido muy bien, pero tienen el sue\u00f1o de ampliarlo, hasta convertirlo en una importante distribuidora de embutidos y carnes fr\u00edas de la regi\u00f3n, para que en el futuro sus dos hijos, que hoy est\u00e1n en las edades de 18 y 21 a\u00f1os de edad, tengan una gran empresa.

","en":"Horacio is a big handsome man who lives in the town of Puerto Colombia, a place located on the shores of the Caribbean sea.  He states in a humorous way, as is the custom of the residents of this area, that a sausage prepared by him has \"effects that activate the imagination,\" and the people can't help but smile at that.  His business is very well-accepted in the market, because it is known for being a welcoming place with a Caribbean flavor.  Horacio has his own business, and he works with his wife selling morcillas (sausages prepared with rice, pig's blood and vegetables), arepas (stuffed grilled corncakes), empanadas, beer, soft drinks and general groceries.  For this couple, the business has done very well.  But they have a dream of expanding it, and even converting it into an important sausage and cold cut distributor in the region, so that in the future their two children, now 18 and 21, can have a big company.  His main challenge, given the expected growth in his market, is that his working capital is insufficient to allow him to buy in greater volume and expand his customer base.  This is the reason that he came to apply for his Kiva loan, which will be his first loan with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy supplies to make sausages and fried foods.  He will also buy soft drinks and other beverages that he will chill and sell to his customers, taking advantage of the heat and the thirst it produces in this land of beaches, breezes and sea which, in combination with his business experience, will make this investment very successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1095679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in the municipality of Salgar, located on the seashore, where the beach, the soft breeze, the sea and the nice and happy people make up a unique culture. She started her business three years ago selling soft drinks, ice, chicha (a cold drink made from maize or fruit), bolis (a traditional form of ice cream found in Colombia), and others out of a cooler. She gradually started offering other products such as bread or finger food. Her business has been growing steadily, allowing her to buy a second cooler, because one was not enough. The majority of her customers are people from the neighbourhood or tourists who, on their way to the beach, choose to stop for refreshments in order to quench the thirst caused by the sun beating down on the earth; thus they happily sip their beverages under the welcome shade of the mango tree that stands on the terrace of Dayulis's house. Since she buys from her supplier only when he comes round in his lorry and her clientele has grown, Dayulis often lacks products to sell, and she has to resort to buying from intermediaries, which makes for a steep mark-up in price. This is why she asks for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the funds to buy beer and soft drinks to stock so as not to have to tell clients that she is out of refreshments or be forced to sell at a higher price. Her investment will pay off because she will have enough beverages to meet demand, as long as her customers continue to enjoy their cool drinks under the shade of the mango tree, in the warm, healthy air of the seashore."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1098591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

He studied until the eighth grade, but then began to work. His father, a mason, taught him how to do that work when he was a very young child. He worked in the trade until six years ago. \r\n\r\nNow Gerardo has a business recycling cardboard, plastic and copper principally. His business involves buying and selling scrap metal, an activity that generates family income, which has been increasing because his customer base has also been growing. Often he does not have sufficient working capital to make the purchases he needs in order to supply his customers. This is the reason he has approached KIVA lenders with his first funding request through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use the loan to buy cardboard, copper, iron and aluminum, all products for which he has as clients the large warehouses of the city.

She is married to Arnulfo and they have three children who are grown and independent.  Kelly lives with her husband and two of her daughters in the house she bought with great effort.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer business involves selling groceries from a space she remodeled in her house.  This is where she serves her customers, most of whom are neighbors, but she has many more.  She started more than nine years ago with her own capital and later continued growing with the loans from MFP.  Kelly considers her business to be profitable because she has a constant stream of customers who come to buy everything she has to offer.  She enjoys her work because it enables her to earn an income for covering her expenses.  Kelly enjoys the peace and comfort of working from home and would like to see her business grow as a result of her effort.  She does not like it when it rains a lot because it becomes difficult to reach her house.  Her sales drop as a result, but this does not discourage her.   \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP organization and she hopes to continue with her goals.  Kelly promises to be punctual with her loan payments.  The amount of 3,000 PEN that she requested will be invested in the purchase of groceries and carbonated beverages to restock her store.  She will also repair the roof and the floor of her shop so that her customers will be more comfortable.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1097785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her store and to pay for repairs to her facilities.

The loan amount of 1,500 PEN that he requested will be used to keep the store in his house in operation.  He will also buy grains and seeds for planting in his field.

Adem\u00e1s, vela la pena recalcar que aunque no logro terminar sus estudios es una mujer muy lista y emprendedora la cual no deja pasar ninguna oportunidad de negocio. Siempre busca la forma de hacer ingresos de manera honrada, dado que los ingresos de su esposo no logran cubrir las principales necesidades. Como toda mujer visionaria, en busca de mejores condiciones de vida solicita este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en la compra de materia prima: ma\u00edz, gas propano, cal, etc. para continuar su negocio de tortillas y lograr que genere un poco mas de ingresos que le permitan colaborar con la econom\u00eda del hogar, la cual cada vez es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil. \n","en":"Ana Susana has been living in the home of her life partner for a long time. She makes and sells delicious tortillas. The location of the business is very strategic, as it is on the main street. She has a large clientele, as her customers express a great deal of satisfaction with the service she provides.\r\n\r\nAs well, it is worth emphasizing that although she did not manage to complete her education, she is a very clever and enterprising woman, who doesn't let any business opportunity pass by. She is always looking for a way of earning income honestly, given that her husband's income is not sufficient to cover the necessities. \r\n\r\nAs a visionary woman seeking a better standard of living, she is applying to Integral for this loan in order to buy ingredients and supplies such as corn, propane gas, lime, etc. This is so that she can continue her tortilla business and succeed in generating a bit more income, allowing her to contribute to the household finances, which are more and more difficult.

They live on the small farm they have tended for the past 2 years. He has been farming for 8 years; in addition to planting, he also works as a bricklayer. He plants each year because the harvest is seasonal and only occurs once a year. After the harvest, he sells his products at the main local markets. This is the way he supports his family because he has no other income sources that would provide them with better circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo he is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL to purchase the necessary agricultural supplies (manure, fertilizers, and seeds) to begin planting corn, which is very important to maintaining and supporting his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1099311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure, fertilizer, and seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-27T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-26T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419770207}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T17:20:59Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T10:43:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":428255,"name":"Yesica Roxana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yesica Roxana vive junto a sus tres hijos; ella se dedica a la venta de joyer\u00eda en variedad cadenas, pulseras, anillos, aritos, etc. Tiene varios a\u00f1os de dedicarse a este comercio y le ha dado muy buenos resultados, ella vende de forma ambulante en todas las zonas aleda\u00f1as a donde reside, se ha hecho de mucha clientela pues saben que todo lo que comercia es de primera calidad y lo vende a precios accesibles adem\u00e1s de un servicio excelente; Yesica es una mujer ejemplar, muy luchadora y entregada al trabajo, piensa que para llegar al \u00e9xito lo m\u00e1s importante es la dedicaci\u00f3n y la perseverancia, est\u00e1 dispuesta a lograrlo por eso en este mes dedicado a las madres quiere invertir  en m\u00e1s joyer\u00eda pero necesita de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar anillos, pulseras, cadenas, aretes, etc. Yesica Roxana tiene muy buenas referencias de pago a cancelado con \u00e9xito cr\u00e9ditos anteriores, por eso tiene la seguridad y el compromiso de cancelar el financiamiento en el periodo establecido y al mismo tiempo darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Yesica Roxana lives with her three children.

She has the advantage of selling the tamales in the streets to her neighbours. \r\n\r\nSantos is committed to her work, enterprising, and above all she enjoys taking advantage of every opportunity that comes her way. She believes that successful people get up and seek out opportunities; they create them if they don\u2019t come across them. She herself is seeking them. Now that she has more customers, she wants to produce more tamales so she has approached INTEGRAL for a loan to buy ingredients such as chicken, corn, tomatoes, beans, cheese etc. Santos has an excellent credit rating and very good references concerning repayments.

She is a dynamic and enterprising woman who works in the retail trade.  Gina sells products through specialty guides, which are purchased from companies that offer their merchandise in Colombia.  She started her business two years ago by selling natural cosmetic products.  Gina slowly gained more customers over time and now has an established clientele of her own.   She is able to multiply her investment, but her greatest challenge is obtaining sufficient capital in order to buy in volume.  By having a good inventory, she will be able to make her enterprise grow.  This is the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  The money will be used to buy perfumes and cosmetics at good prices since she will be able to get a discount.  \r\n<p>\r\nGina's enthusiasm cannot be contained since she spends every day visiting with current and potential customers and also collecting her outstanding bills, which makes her happy.  She stays in contact with people because she is good at managing interpersonal relationships.  Gina has developed a niche in the marketplace and has earned a position for herself as a result of her personal interactions.  Her greatest wish is to have a location where she can open a store to the public.  What would give her the greatest satisfaction is seeing her children get an education at the finest institutions.  This is the motivation that drives her to wake up each day with enthusiasm.  Gina is taking matters into her own hands when it comes to seeing her children reach their potential for success.

She is married to Candelario, an installer, and father to their six children. She manages the household while attending to her business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa operates a water refilling station. In the Philippines, a water refilling station is an alternative source of drinking water that sells purified water, distilled, ionized and alkaline water. Aside from the water refilling station business, she also has an RTW business; this is the term for factory-made clothing, sold in finished condition, in standardized sizes, as distinct from made-to-measure or bespoke clothing tailored to a particular person's frame. She manages this business together with her husband. \r\n\r\nElsa earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day at her water refilling station, and PHP 500 at their RTW store.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to invest more in her business, buying related products or materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to maintain the growth of her business and be able to support the schooling of her children. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. Here she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1103760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water

She is 45 years old, married and has two children, ages 22 and 19. Working 6 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

As the main source of income for her family, Suyumkan is engaged in livestock breeding, after having started this business in 1976. Thanks to Suyumkan's hard work, her farm, which was started with an amount of 10,000 som (KGS), now counts 3 cows, 13 sheep, 14 goats and 3 horses. This allows her to make a profit in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and dairy products. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Suyumkan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. Suyumkan plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

","en":"Qumriniso is an older woman, who has four sons, and the youngest wants to marry. Qumriniso has prepared for this, saving a dowry for the bride. In our area, according to the old ritual, the groom's family should give dowry before the wedding. All these gifts are expensive and therefore one needs to prepare several years for this arrangement. \r\n\r\nQumriniso works as a nurse at the hospital and after having been told about our services by her colleague, she came to our organization for a loan. She liked the terms of partial payment and she received her first loan for her needs. As the sons, daughters in law and husband of her family works, they help her with the repayment, and she does not find it difficult to cover her loan. Currently she intends to continue working with us - receiving a round sum it covers her major

This communal bank is made up of people that look for opportunities to get ahead at each moment and give a better future to their children with their daily effort. The members' economic activities, for example, are: selling traditional crafts, food, clothing, dry grains, and wood, and others work as teachers, master builders, and public workers.\r\n\r\n(Ruth is raising her hand in the photograph.) The member Ruth was born in the city of Lima but has lived in the city of Urubamba for seven years. She is 45 years old and has a common law marriage from which she has three children (Estefany, 22 years of age who studies at a national university; Antony, 18 years of age who studies at a private university; and Leo, 14 years years of age who is in high school). Ruth's main economic activity is selling cylinders of gas and she has a small shop in her home. She has already been making a living doing this business for seven years and things are going very well for her thanks to the determination that she puts into it. The member Ruth also makes a living making food for patron saint's day parties. Her husband is a building worker and as such makes a living building houses. At this time Ruth needs the loan to buy a circular machine saw to cut wood which will allow her husband to speed up his work.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the members are thankful for the opportunity given to them and commit themselves to fulfilling the payments of their different installments according to the established terms. (The members that appear in the lower part of the photograph asked for permission from the communal bank's directive committee to not be present at the meeting.)\r\n\r\nCusco is located in the district and province of Cusco of the department of Cusco in the heart of the ancient city of the Incas.

She would have liked to have gone on to study nursing.\r\n\r\nRosario works very enthusiastically in her business selling soft drinks, soda and candies.  She works around 8 hours a day and can serve up to 40 customers a day.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is kind to all her customers and, above all, her business is in a good location.\r\n\r\nRosario is very happy and grateful for the help that she is being given by Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, she will be able to make some improvements to her premises, painting walls, improving the electrics, etc.  This will improve the condition of her premises and make them more comfortable for her customers.  As a result, she will be able to improve her income and continue working hard so that she can fulfill her biggest dream: to own her own

Elshan\u2019s father taught him how to look after cattle and he now has more than 10 years of experience in this field.\n\nElshan usually buys small cattle or lambs, raises and fattens them for five to six months and resells them for a profit in the local livestock bazaar.  By selling meat, he earns 120 AZN per month. People use beef and mutton in everyday national dishes and sheep fur is also very popular to make blankets.   \n\nElshan provides the only financial income for his family and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.  He applied for a 1,000 AZN loan to purchase one cow and six sheep.  This loan will be his second from Kiva partner AqroInvest.

He is an internally displaced person (IDP) and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.   He breeds cows and cattle and sells milk and milk products as well as the cattle meat to local butchers.  Ramil\u2019s father taught him how to look after cattle and he now has more than 10 years of experience in this field. He receives 70 AZN monthly in financial support from the government, but this amount is too low to cover his family\u2019s needs.\n\nRamil usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for five to six months and resells them for a profit in the local livestock bazaar.  He sells milk and yoghurt to his neighbors.  Selling milk and meat provides Ramil with 100 AZN per month. Milk, yoghurt, and meat are very popular products in Azerbaijan as they are used in everyday national dishes. Milk products are also considered very healthy.   \n\nRamil earns the only income for his family and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.  Ramil applied for a 1,000 AZN loan to purchase cattle and fodder.  Ramil has good client history and this will be the second loan from Kiva partner

a 35-year-old hardworking woman, lives with her family in a ger (a traditional Mongolian felt tent) in a ger district which lacks basic infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her husband is a driver for a local gas company, having previously worked for a public transportation company for 9 years.\n\nJavzanpagma started her business in the ending of 2004 and the beginning of 2005 by selling building materials at Tsaiz, the largest outdoor wood market in Mongolia, with a working capital of 2,000,000 MNT. She buys raw materials from a wood truck which comes from the countryside, and as a result of her hard work, she now has working capital of 8,500,000 MNT. \n\nJavzanpagma is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to buy more wood for the upcoming season. Her business is very popular during the summertime, so she wants to purchase more wood as a reserve. Javzanpagma wants her children to get an excellent education and her goal for the upcoming year is to build a new small house for her family. A repeat and trusted client, she is very thankful to all Kiva lenders for giving her an opportunity to improve her business. In addition, Kiva Fellow Jonathan has visited her house and really enjoyed it.

The main challenge for her is the lack of working capital and seeds for her farm due to flooding in the past years. \r\nLey's group consists of four female members who live in the same village. She has been with VisionFund for three cycles while the other members have been with VisionFund for one to four cycles. The past loans from VisionFund have helped her support her business and gradually make a better living. She earns about KHR 23,000 per day from her current business to spend for daily expenses. She is leading this group to apply for a loan with VisionFund. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizers and seeds for her farmland and spend a portion of it on plowing. She hopes this loan will help her to raise more good quality crops to sell so she can keep her children in school. She also hopes to fulfill her dream of having a new, larger house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1105344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers and seeds for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-05-28T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-27T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savoeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":606750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288461},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":505625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315518977},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":606750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265533},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":353937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640790},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":1450000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1466312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347196825}],"funded_date":"2012-05-28T20:02:57Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:29:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":431269,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is taking out another loan to expand her existing business.

She has been with Kiva\u2019s field partner, VisionFund, for three cycles while the other members have been with VisionFund for two to three cycles. She is leading her group to apply for a loan with VisionFund. Nimol, who is the group leader, is going to use her portion to purchase fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to buy one piglet and pay for plowing. She hopes this loan will help her grow more rice and feed her pigs to be fat and healthy so she can set aside some money to extend her farmland and purchase a hand tractor for rice farming. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1105370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-05-28T17:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-27T17:00:09Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokheng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1516875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118504},{"amount":525,"local_amount":2100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2123625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046207}],"funded_date":"2012-05-28T21:46:52Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":431275,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa is a single parent with 2 children.

One of the children goes to school.\n\nMartin has been in the business of selling used clothes since 2006 and works six days a week by moving from market to market on different designated days.
