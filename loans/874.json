Esto hace que d\u00eda con d\u00eda se levante muy temprano para preparar los materiales que le permitir\u00e1n elaborar las ricas tortillas. Cabe mencionar que tiene mucha clientela ya que con el tiempo ha logrado ganarse la confianza de sus vecinos los cuales cada d\u00eda la prefieren m\u00e1s.

She has been operating a tortilla shop out of her home for five years and it is the only work that she does to help her children get ahead.  The father of her children does not help with raising them.  Her income is not sufficient since her children are studying and the daily demands get greater.  This motivates her to wake up early to begin preparing the ingredients she uses for making her delicious tortillas.  It should be mentioned that she has many customers because she has gained the trust of her neighbors over time and their preference for her product grows more each day.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna and her family live under very modest conditions, but this does not dampen her drive to succeed and continue fighting.  Each day she invests in firewood and corn in bulk so that she will have supplies on reserve.  When winter arrives, it is difficult to secure these products since the prices are higher.  On this occasion, Ana is not able to make this investment on her own, so she is requesting a loan from Apoyo Integral for this very reason.  Given that this business is her main source of income by which she is able to sustain her family, Ana is confident that she will be able to buy these products since they are necessary for keeping her tortilla shop in operation.

She lives in a very beautiful and picturesque community that is surrounded by pine-covered hills; the pine trees provide Amelia with a source of raw material for the Ocoshal [woven pine fiber] crafts she makes.  Amelia enjoys living in her community because her culture is deeply rooted there, since most of the locals speak the Mazahua language and wear traditional Mazahua clothing.  \r\n\r\nAmelia is widowed and has 5 children, all of them married.  She has lived alone for two years.  She makes a living growing and selling avocados.  She also makes handicrafts to sell, which she has done ever since a nun taught her how to make Ocoshal crafts more than ten years ago.  Amelia is asking for a loan so she can purchase materials she needs for making Ocoshal handicrafts, such as needles and thread, as well as soap and bleach for washing the pine fibers.  She weaves the fibers into baskets, tortilla baskets, breadbaskets, vases, mats, jewelry boxes, and many other items.  \r\n\r\nAmelia is also going to use the loan to purchase fertilizer and insecticide in order to improve the quality of her avocado trees.  She says that even though her trees are small right now, she expects to get her first avocado crop in December and will definitely earn a profit from her trees.  Amelia is excited about the loan because it will allow her to improve the quality of her avocados.  She hopes to use the profits from her first crop to purchase a pump for bringing water up to her land, since she has difficulty walking up the hill carrying buckets of water and then watering her trees by hand.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Mar\u00eda Leucadia, Irma, and Mar\u00eda Crisanta.  Like Amelia, they are also going to use their shares of the loan to purchase supplies for growing avocados as well as materials for making Ocoshal handicrafts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1097567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies for growing avocados such as fertilizer and insecticide, and to purchase materials for making Ocoshal handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-28T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-27T21:00:08Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Leucadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Crisanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4442.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4620.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4770.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5194.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5387.53},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5617.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":409.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":323.66,"local_amount":4442.41,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4457.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419038},{"amount":336.61,"local_amount":4620.11,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4636.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568614},{"amount":347.55,"local_amount":4770.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-30T08:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4787.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399902},{"amount":361.92,"local_amount":4967.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4984.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407581},{"amount":378.45,"local_amount":5194.42,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5212.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392099},{"amount":392.52,"local_amount":5387.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5406.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119964},{"amount":409.29,"local_amount":5617.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5637.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068028}],"funded_date":"2012-06-02T12:58:24Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":428833,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, firewood and lime.

She started the business from her own savings.\r\n\r\nDama was introduced to Milango by a friend and is applying for a loan of 41,850 Kenya shillings to purchase additional retail stock such as flour, beans, salt, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\nDama is optimistic that the income from this loan will help her pay for her children's education. The challenge has been the high cost of materials, a situation she hopes to resolve by purchasing the items in bulk. \r\n\r\nHer future ambition is to own a wholesale shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1105829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

unassuming, indigenous people.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are from a small village called San Pedro Amuzgos which is located in Oaxaca, the land of embroidery.  All the people in this town make embroidered goods: dresses,'huipiles' (traditional dresses) and embroidered robes, traditional clothing of the region.  They tell us that, in the past, there were no threads for weaving so the men would grow cotton so that their wives could use the thread to weave.  Nowadays, Amuzgos men also weave and embroider.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is 42-year-old Socorro.  Soco, as she is better known by her fellow group members, has a business selling Mexican snack food such as quesadillas, entomatadas, soups, fried tacos and chicken empanadas.  She says that she used to sell 'paletas' (ice pops made from fresh fruit).  She did this for seven years but stopped because she lacked the materials she needed to make her ice pops.  She hasn't been making her delicious ice pops for four months.\r\n\r\nSoco is happily married to Jos\u00e9 and the couple have two children: Juan Daniel and Irais Concepci\u00f3n.  Their children are their biggest treasure.  One of Soco's dreams is to re-open her ice pop business so that she can create more jobs in her community as she has carts from which to sell her products.  She requested this loan to buy more machines for making ice pops.  She would also like to be able to re-equip her premises.\r\n\r\nSocorro is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they give to all indigenous and hard-working women.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nGuadalupe Claudia - who makes and sells handicrafts\r\nRosalia - who sells sweet treats\r\nDora - who sells Internet access\r\nJose - who sells sweet treats\r\nRosa - who sells groceries\r\nMacrina - who sells bread.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group thank Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for supporting hard-working and indigenous

She works very hard so that she can provide her son with the best in life.  Above all, she provides him with a lot of love and affection.  Angela's home is located in Parcona district.  This area is noted for its warm climate and its agriculture, above all its cotton production.  Whenever Angela has any free time she likes going out for walks with her little one and she enjoys preparing one of her favorite dishes which is the delicious 'arroz con pollo' (chicken and rice).  Owing to her parents' lack of financial means, Angela only managed to study to high school level.  However, she would have liked to have gone on to study nursing.  For this reason, she works hard so that her son can do better than she did.\r\n\r\nAngela works enthusiastically every day in her business selling burgers, salchipapas (sliced sausages and fries), pollipapas (shredded chicken and fries) and other products.  She works around six hours a day and can serve up to thirty customers.  She believes that her business is doing well because her food is very tasty.  For this reason, her customers are always happy with the dishes she makes.\r\n\r\nAngela is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy a display case and a freezer cabinet.  This will enable her to display her dishes more hygienically and she will be able to preserve the supplies that she uses to prepare her dishes correctly.  In this way, she will be able to improve her income and continue working hard so that she can achieve her biggest dream: to provide her son with a good education and a good quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1100486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

His wife and two children who are 2 and 4 years old live alongside him; they are his adoration and although they are very little still they already cause his hair to turn gray because of the mischief they get into.  They are his greatest motivation and above all his reason to live and to get ahead every day.\r\n\r\nHis house is located in the city of Ica, a city characterized for being known as the Land of the Eternal Sun because the climate is always hot all year round.  Agriculture, especially growing cotton, grapes and asparagus, among others also takes place here.  When he has free time available, Belgrano likes to go out with his family and also to play soccer with his friends and neighbors in the neighborhood.  On occasion he also asks his wife to prepare him his favorite dish, the very delicious \u201cArroz con Pato.\u201d  Because of his parents\u2019 poor economic resources he only went to secondary school but would have liked to have studied mechanical engineering.\r\n\r\nWith much effort, Belgrano works in his business as a mototaxi driver.  He spends about 12 hours daily at work and can take care of up to 40 customers per day.  He believes that he does well in his business because he treats his customers with kindness.\r\n\r\nBelgrano is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given him he will buy new tires and doors and will service his vehicle to have a vehicle in good conditions to be able to continue working with more safety for his customers so that he can continue striving daily towards making his greatest dream a reality:   to own a house and give a good education and a quality life to his children.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1100529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy tires and doors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-28T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-27T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belgrano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":143.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":149.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":157.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":161.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":174.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":181.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":190.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":195.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":203.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":423733,"name":"Saffi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saffi is 52 years old and lives in the town of Koboko in the Arua region of Uganda.

She lives in Barranquila and sells shoes. The shoes are made in Aruba. She sells them to her customers on layaway. She buys the shoes after she gets the orders. She started this business five years ago with $200,000 COP of working capital that was provided to her by her family. The business helps her with her household expenses. She is a widow. She has a minor child that is 17 years old. She focuses all of her energy on her work so that her child can have an education and be successful. She would like to change her business into a well-organized store in her home where her customers can shop for a variety of merchandise. They wouldn\u2019t have to wait to receive the merchandise they request. She is applying to KIVA for the first time through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use the loan to buy shoes wholesale, in the brands that her customers request the most. These loyal customers are the ones who appreciate the information and good service that Doris provides. Her biggest challenge is that she has insufficient working capital so she can\u2019t respond to her customer requests. The money she has from previous customers does not cover the increasing demand of the new customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1101078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes wholesale.

For the past four years, with money that they had saved, they bought sweets to sell. Little by little they started buying other products, until they had all the products they sell today. Their business has a lot of potential. They sell their products very quickly. The working capital that Patricia has does not allow her to buy a variety of products nor have a large inventory. She needs to buy new items before the current items are sold. This is why she is requesting a loan from KIVA and the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use this loan to buy sodas, sweets and snacks at a wholesale level. These are items that she needs in order to have a good inventory for her customers so that they are happy when they travel. If, when they patronize the business of Patricia and her husband, they find what they desire, Paticia and her husband will be successful"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1101083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy large quantities of soda, sweets, snacks and a variety of other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-29T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-28T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75654},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84451},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86421},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":88438},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90501},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":92613},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":94774},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":96985},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":99248},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":101564},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":103934},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":115417}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":75654,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":76532.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101219},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":83358,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84326.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395388},{"amount":47.39,"local_amount":85674,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86669.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387176},{"amount":489.66,"local_amount":885314,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":895596.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071101}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T01:10:05Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":429256,"name":"Sol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Desde hace 12 a\u00f1os, Sol una mujer de 46 a\u00f1os, se dedic\u00f3 a la venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos y perfumer\u00eda, mediante gu\u00edas especializadas; aunque al principio, su relaci\u00f3n de vinculaci\u00f3n con varias revistas, no fue duradera, adquiri\u00f3 mucha experiencia comercial y solo cuando una amiga le present\u00f3 una mejor propuesta de trabajo de ventas de productos cosm\u00e9ticos y accesorios, empez\u00f3 a trabajar con  ella, ganando un porcentaje de lo que vend\u00eda, pero sin vincularse directamente a la revista. Cuando Sol gan\u00f3 un buen mercado y se sinti\u00f3 segura de su estabilidad en esta tarea comercial,  se vincul\u00f3 directamente a esa empresa, con la cual le fue bien y expandi\u00f3 su clientela.

Although at the beginning her connections to various companies were not long lasting, she gained a lot of retail experience. Only when a friend presented her with a better sales job offer for cosmetic products and accessories did she begin to work with her, earning a percentage of what she sold, but without connecting herself directly with the company. When Sol had acquired a good client base and she felt sure of the stability in this commercial sector, she connected directly with this catalog company. This has gone well for her and she has expanded her client base. \r\n\r\nCurrently Sol has three family members who support her business and are also earning money, which she likes a lot, so she keeps it active permanently. \r\n\r\nMost of her customers are women, house wives, and employees. She sells products to them on credit, and in the end they pay in installments of a month. \r\n\r\nSol is passionate for her job, and every day she has her own goals, which she frequently makes - such as gaining three customers a day - and she doesn't limit herself to her own neighborhood. She also looks for opportunities in other neighborhoods, even though they're 15, 20 or 40 minutes away. Through her connection with this company, she has won many prizes. She has impressive sales volume, and she expects this to continue. She supports her husband, an independent builder, and their three children who are between the ages of 9 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nIn her business she is very committed; she has all of her accounts well organized and she collects payments weekly. \r\n\r\nSol's greatest challenge is improving the terms of credit to her customers, but her suppliers demand the payments. This is why she is turning to a Kiva loan - her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo - to buy cosmetics at a discount, and to offer better and more varied financing options to her customers. She will also pass along discount opportunities, which will grow her business as a result, and make possible a successful investment of her Kiva loan.

family. Living in Dambae district where a common business is planting cassava, Saroun and her family have been planting such crop and farming rice for almost twenty years to support their family. She struggles when she has insufficient rice to eat and scarce capital for her cassava business. Her family makes around six US dollar per day. Saroun has been with VisionFund for four loan cycles and is now leading a group of three female members to request another loan from VisionFund after completely paying off their previous debt.

Since 2006 she has been running her business; before this she used to work as a chief cook in another restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and her daughter on her plot of land in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. She has three old houses on her plot of land and she rents two of them. But lately her houses have been in very bad condition and need repairs. So she wants to take a loan to buy the building materials for the repairs of her old houses. \r\n\r\nShe is planning to insulate the walls of her own living house first. Because it becomes very cold inside the house without wall insulation, it costs too much money for the smoky coal needed to warm the inside of the house. \r\n\r\nAlso lack of insulation has a bad effect on the air of the city. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters, when temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities. Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Ariunaa is taking will be dedicated to buying building materials to make repairs and to insulate the walls of her house to reduce heat loss and emissions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1106051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Very soon it began to stand out because of its style and elegance, and nowadays the shop is working out of one of the rooms in her own house.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to have her own brand to expand her market into something less domestic and more technically-based.  She also wants to open her own clothing store.  As her business grows, Irina requires more work capital to take advantage of goods on sale so she can be more competitive in the market.  This is what motivated her to resort to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a CrediKiva loan.  She will use it to buy wholesale fabrics and supplies such as thread and appliqu\u00e9s, so she can make her new designs into works of art, which is what her women and young lady customers mainly want."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1101123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy wholesale fabric and supplies such as thread and appliqu\u00e9s.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-29T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-28T09:10:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117077},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119808},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":122604},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125465},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128392},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":131388},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":134454},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":137591},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":140802},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144087},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147449},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.03,"local_amount":117077,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":117104.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101220},{"amount":40.92,"local_amount":74823,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":74840.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387178},{"amount":308.02,"local_amount":563240,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":563372.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130388},{"amount":462.03,"local_amount":844860,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":845058.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706037}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T03:03:16Z","paid_date":"2013-07-22T08:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":431647,"name":"Enhtuya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enhtuya is a married woman lives with her husband and three children in a ger (Mongolian yurt) in Darhan Province, Mongolia.

They are all working in agriculture; some raise lambs, other sell fresh milk and buttermilk. They have a shared plot of land for growing ground nuts. They are assisted by the males in their families for the more difficult tasks, but are essentially in charge of all activities until the harvest. Profits from their sales allow them to purchase, once a year, new clothes, furniture or bracelets. They also participate actively to sharing food costs for their households.

When she first started, she had just been forced to move from her home village; her son provided her with seed capital to buy a full set of kitchen appliances and launch a food-making business. She started with a pot, a cauldron and a wooden table: with these she made fried products such as cornmeal rolls filled with sugar, cheese, or eggs, as well as empanadas and others. She still dreams of expanding her business and she plans on improving her equipment, since she needs a fridge in which to store her raw ingredients. The lack of one is a challenge because it means more work every day and thus less efficiency. Thus she asks for a Kiva loan in order to buy a fridge. It will enable her to be more efficient and to save time, which she will use to look for new markets in order to keep growing and to improve her living conditions as a woman and a widow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1101134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a fridge.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-29T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-28T12:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64147},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79791},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81653},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83558},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85508},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87503},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89545},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91634},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93772},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95960},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98199},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118730}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":64147,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":65789.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338839},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":79791,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81834.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395391},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":81653,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83743.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775185},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":83558,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85697.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387180},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":85508,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":87697.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994024},{"amount":49.07,"local_amount":87503,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":89743.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130390},{"amount":50.21,"local_amount":89545,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91838.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519270},{"amount":51.39,"local_amount":91634,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":93980.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071104},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":93772,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96173.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497332},{"amount":53.81,"local_amount":95960,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":98417.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527165},{"amount":121.64,"local_amount":216929,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":222484,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927955}],"funded_date":"2012-05-30T02:46:46Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":431719,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is a fish vendor from Panglao, Bohol.

In 1993, with a starting capital of 100 soms, she began an animal raising business.

He lives with his wife and 17 year-old son, who is his reason for living and for going forward each day. His home is located in Ica, a city noted for having a warm climate at any time of year. That is why it is called the \"Land of Eternal Sun\". \r\n\r\nWhen he has free time, he likes to go to his small parcel of land to do planting or watering. He enjoys this a great deal, and above all, it gets him away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Sometimes he likes to eat one of his favorite dishes, which is the very delicious \u201cpatasca\u201d (a stew made with meat and hominy corn). He only went as far as high school, but would have liked to have studied veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of effort, Eduin works in his business making and selling bricks. It is very laborious work, and above all, it must be done very carefully in order to avoid accidents. He works in his business for around eight hours daily and can serve up to three customers a day. He believes that his business is doing well because he is very hard-working and above all friendly to his customers.\r\n\r\nEduin is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help they have given him, he will be able to do the paperwork necessary to register his land title with the city's municipal government. This way he will avoid them being able to take away his small piece of land for not being registered. This way, he will be able to continue striving to make his greatest dream a reality: \u201dTo be able to see my business grow and help my son have a profession\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1101203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To do the paperwork necessary to register his land title.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-29T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-28T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduin Nelen ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":104.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":113.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":123.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":128.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":104.87,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222485},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":110.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":115.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298550},{"amount":44.72,"local_amount":113.84,"processed_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":119.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351284},{"amount":46.59,"local_amount":118.6,"processed_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":124.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108930},{"amount":48.68,"local_amount":123.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":129.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345107},{"amount":50.57,"local_amount":128.73,"processed_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":135.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954325}],"funded_date":"2012-05-30T07:46:07Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":428965,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He has been running a kiosk business for eight years to provide for his living costs. He uses an empty room as a kiosk. Basic daily items are available at his kiosk such as detergents, shampoo, snacks and candies. \r\nHajral would like to add more variety of stock and improve his kiosk business by offering PlayStation games rental, but the profit he currently generates is not sufficient to support his plan. Hajral heard that Kiva partner TLM can help him by providing a business loan. He submitted a loan application requesting a loan of 12,000,000 IDR from TLM. This loan will be used to buy more stock, e.g. rice, wheat flour, cigarettes, snacks etc. for his kiosk and to buy three PlayStation units and televisions. He is sure that the improvement of his business will bring benefits to him in the

","en":"The story of Monica's business started when she was working in a shoe store, where she worked for many years. She worked long exhausting days, and didn't have time to dedicate to her children, who require greater attention. She decided to resign from her job and start her own business venture, using the experience she gained in her job. And so it went, with the support of a supplier, she started selling shoes, purses and clothing on credit, and every three months made payments to her provider. The provider was the first support she had in her decision to start her own business. Gradually her customer base grew and the options she had for where to purchase her goods also increased, so that her list of suppliers expanded to include others in different \r\ncities of the country, like Barranquilla y Bucaramanga. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to have available working cash, so she can buy products when there is an opportunity in the market in these cities. Her biggest challenge is meeting the growing demand of the market, and having enough money on hand to respond to the demands of her clients, allowing her to take advantage of the potential profit. This is the reason she has requested a Kiva loan, which will be the first loan she has taken out through the 'Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo'. She will use the money to purchase shoes and purses made of leather, which have already been pre-ordered by her customers, which means that this loan has great potential for success.
