I come from a family of four. I have one older sister and two younger brothers. My sister has just completed her second year at university. My younger brother will be beginning at high school next year, while the last-born has just begun middle school. My father is a chemist. My mother is a nurse at a government hospital.\r\n\r\nI believe in quality education. Having worked hard and attaining a position at one of the top schools in Kenya, I want to continue my pursuit for quality education at Strathmore University, a prestigious university in Nairobi, Kenya with a reputation for its excellence. I attained admission to Strathmore University to join the pioneer Law class at its recently opened Strathmore Law School. The course begins on 25th June 2012. \r\n\r\nI would require the loan so as to pay for my tuition costs. As the university gives the highest quality education in the country thus its tuition fees are also expensive. All my siblings require a lot of financial support from my parents who are average income earners which makes it hard for them to manage providing for all our education needs.  This has made me fear for my future, thus making me think of ways of completing my studies and attaining my dreams and ambition of becoming a top lawyer in the country.\r\n\r\nThis loan will enable me to focus on my studies as it will give me assurance that I will complete my course without any financial setbacks and will give me peace to focus on my class work and achieve my goals in life. \r\n\r\nI am an easy-going person who is easy to talk to. I do not anger quickly but instead listen to the whole story before I react. I am very social as I do not shy away from conversation. Also ambitious, I am quite the go-getter; once I have my eyes set on something, very little can be done to stop me. \r\n\r\nUpon graduation, I intend to venture into public service to provide legal assistance to the needy in society. I also plan to venture into policy making so as to make an impact not only in society but also the world.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":17650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":17650,"image":{"id":1105237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

For this reason, little by little her clientele has increased and she needs to increase her working capital, get some money together so she can have more favorable purchasing terms with special discounts and wholesale.  Currently she has to wait for her customers to pay her.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is coming for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy an industrial machine with which she will increase her production of cleaning cloths and so have more profitability.  In addition, she will invest in perfume orders and in cosmetics.\r\n\r\nWe are certain of the success of her Kiva loan because she is supported by her mother, who knows the industrial cleaning cloth market and is the one who is driving her.  In addition, she buys her merchandise on the basis of requests from her most profitable customers, whom she looks after, so she needs to respond opportunely to meet their

children. In 1990, in search of a source of income for her family, Mukhabat began her own business selling women's knitted wear at the market with an initial 10,000 som (KGS) investment. Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Mukhabat succeeded in developing the company, and now earns a monthly income of 40,000 som (KGS). Her inventory is currently limited so Mukhabat turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a 135,000 som (KGS) loan. Mukhabat plans to use part of her profits to buy materials for repairs to her home, and part for business development.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1103896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"expand

Starting in the year 2000 Gulmira worked in a financial company where she earned a low salary. Following her divorce with her husband, after which she was the sole provider for her children, Gulmira decided to travel to Russia to find work but because of health problems she returned. In 2009 in search of a source of income for her family she used an initial investment of 17,000 som (KGS) to start her own business selling consumer goods at market.Thanks to her persistence and hard work Gulmira was able to expand her business and she now earns a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS). Her inventory is currently limited, so Gulmira turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 som (KGS) loan. She plans to invest the income she earns into further development of the business. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1103910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T04:00:06Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3258},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3172},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3252},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3416},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3589},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3679},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3771},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3865},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3962},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4061},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4162},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4267},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4373},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4483},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4595},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4709},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4827},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4948},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5072},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5198},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5328},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5178}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":429451,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, vive con su esposo y tres hijos, todos ellos trabajan, por su parte apoya a su esposo en la agricultura quien siempre se a dedicado al cultivo de ma\u00edz, no tienen un horario establecido pero a trav\u00e9s de este trabajo a logrado mantener a su familia.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en insumos agr\u00edcolas como el abono, herbicidas, esta compra le permitir\u00e1 obtener lo necesario para trabajar en la tierra y recibir una buena producci\u00f3n.\nEl objetivo de Mar\u00eda es aumentar sus cultivos y darle lo mejor a sus hijos ayud\u00e1ndoles a superarse.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda lives with her husband and three children.

This business is popular in the Mongolian market. She has been running her business since 2006. She buys the skins from the rural households and herders and sells them to the customers in urban areas. Bringing the livestock meat and skins to the city is very expensive. She lives with her son and daughter in an apartment in Kherlen, an eastern city in Mongolia. Her daughter works as a vendor in the grocery store and her son attends the secondary school. Altankhuar is requesting a loan to buy the building materials to renovate her apartment rooms. She is planning to replace the windows of her rooms with better insulated windows. It is very important to reduce the heat loss and emissions through the windows. In the winter, she uses the furnace with coal to warm her apartment. But using the coal creates too much air pollution. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1107155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to cover the cost of replacing windows in her house and reduce heat loss and emissions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Kherlen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altankhuar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146360},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":189727.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":197177.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":207664.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":208110.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":227899.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230194.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":237595.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":252573.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":259497.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":269358.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":273842.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.53},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.48,"local_amount":146360,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":147911.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294313333},{"amount":145.81,"local_amount":189727.07,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":191738.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369435},{"amount":151.53,"local_amount":197177.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":199267.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129204},{"amount":159.6,"local_amount":207664.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":209865.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315365079},{"amount":159.93,"local_amount":208110.8,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":210317.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322974189},{"amount":175.15,"local_amount":227899.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":230315.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331111358},{"amount":176.91,"local_amount":230194.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":232634.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339500916},{"amount":182.59,"local_amount":237595.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":240114.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347053089},{"amount":811,"local_amount":1055271.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1066459.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355798834}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T01:23:40Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T12:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":432191,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a single man who has been doing welding for the last five years.

Luis is a very hard worker and optimistic, and therefore he came up with the idea of selling salchipapas (hot dogs and fried potatoes), broasted chicken and salchipollos.  He spends four hours a day at his work and his wife helps a lot with cooking and preparation of sauces.  In the morning, Luis works at a natural product company for eight hours.  He believes his business is going well because he is a hard worker, a good cook and, above all else, is kind and responsible.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful for the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he can buy tables, chairs and benches for his customers.  This will allow him to provide better customer service and improve his income, so he can continue striving toward making his grandest dream come true: \"To give his children a good education and, especially, a good quality of life\".\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1101500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Yanet sells food and Alma Rosa sells soft drinks and cosmetics.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Alma Rosa, who is better known as Do\u00f1a Alma, is 27 years old and described as a friendly and hardworking woman.  She sells soft drinks and cosmetics.  The soft drinks are sold from her home and the cosmetics are offered in the neighboring subdivisions in her community.  Alma says that she started her business with the help of her mother-in-law, who always told her that she should sell soft drinks.  However, she only did it occasionally because she did not have money as a result of dealing with emergencies.  This caused her great anguish when she decided to start selling soft drinks.  Her children (Ana Priscila, Jes\u00fas, and Aid\u00e9) help with the business.  Alma says that they are happy because she has improved their quality of life.

It has recently become an important point between the mountain region and the coastal region of Ecuador. It's a special place, not just because of it's rich ethnic diversity but also for the unusual landscapes that can be seen as soon as you enter the city. Santo Domingo de los Colorados is part of the recently-formed province of Santo Domingo Ts\u00e1chilas. The main holiday in Santo Domingo is celebrated with a huge influx of visitors and commercial and cultural exchanges. A large fair takes place on the grounds of the Cattlemen's Association. At the fair, examples of the different breeds and mixed breeds of cows from ranches all over the region are shown in competition. \r\n\r\nJefferson has had a party supply store for 2 years. He started his business as soon as he turned 18 and his mother currently helps him run it. With his earnings he is able to contribute to the household income. \r\n\r\nStarting the business was not easy because Jefferson has a very short credit history. Nonetheless, he has decided to make a big investment in merchandise in order to finally finish stocking his store, which lacks certain items like costumes and other things. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that with this loan he will be able to achieve his first short-term goal, which is to expand his clientele and make his business sustainable. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1102189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for his party store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jefferson Alonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":429910,"name":"Juan Raul","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio se sigue dedicando al negocio de elaboracion y venta de artesania,el socio vende chompas,polos,chalinas entre otras artesanias,el socio tiene una tienda donde atiende desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio el socio quiere salira adelante,el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar y mejorar el negocio de venta de artesania.El socio solicita el credito para comprar polos,chompas y chalinas.\n\nEl socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"Juan Raul continues working in the production and sales of arts and crafts.

She lives in the district of Santiago, which is known for its warm climate. Agriculture is a common activity there, especially the cultivation of cotton, corn, peppers, asparagus, and artichokes, among other crops. When Ericka has free time, she enjoys watching television, especially her favorite serial dramas, and above all, she likes to take advantage of opportunities to eat her favorite dishes, such as the delicious \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d [chicken with rice]. She was studying to become an executive secretary, but due to economic problems, she was not able to complete her degree. \r\n\r\nWith great enthusiasm, Ericka works as an operator at a gas station. She works about 10 hours each day. It is rather tiring work, since she usually has to be on her feet almost all day to serve the customers. She believes that her work is going well for her, because the customers she serves always come back happily, since she is very friendly and for this reason there are no complaints about her. \r\n\r\nEricka is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have provided to her, she will be able to buy furniture for her home, since currently at her house people sit only on bricks covered with fabric, and they eat at an improvised table made of plywood. In this way she will be able to improve her quality of life, and thus keep working each day to make her greatest dream a reality: \"to have her own house,\" since she currently lives in a rented house.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArceli hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He points out that his goal is to increase his economic earnings and at the same time obtain a good harvest so that he can continue developing the agricultural activity, since he is elderly and depends on this activity for his living. \r\n\r\nThis is Domingo's first loan. He is a member of the communal bank Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de La Danta S.A. He is very grateful for this option to acquire quick financing and with repayment terms that are acceptable for hardworking people who want to get ahead.

She is 45 years old and a widow.  To provide a primary source of income for her family, Gulnar has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 25 years, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).

Tinatin mainly produces cheese and yogurt. The family's total average monthly income is 100 laris. They live below the poverty line and according to Credo estimations belong to the \"vulnerable poor\" category. \r\n\r\nTinatin requested credit for start-up of a pig farm. Her loan request was approved in the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. With the received credit Tinatin will purchase 10 piglets. She will feed them for 8-9 months and sell most of the grown pigs for a higher price. She won\u2019t sell all of the pigs, but will keep two pigs, which will provide on average 20 piglets per year. Tinatin and Vazha will sell piglets, mainly in their and nearby villages. As a result of the new business initiative, the income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to combat their poverty. In addition, the Kiva start-up loan will allow the family to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market in the future, in case of

This is her story: \r\n\r\nMy name is Olivia. I am 18 years old. My parents are unemployed while four of my brothers who are working are casual laborers with unstable financial status. In secondary school, I was the Head girl in both schools and while in High School, I was the Chair lady of the Wildlife Club, a member of the science congress club where I proceeded to the nationals twice and also a member of the Young Farmers Club.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University because it is one of the best universities in the country and therefore Strathmore graduates stand among the finest. It has outstanding performance in both curriculum and co-curriculum activities. \r\n\r\nI am requesting the loan to pay my tuition fees. This is because my parents are unable to pay my tuition fees. My high school education was sponsored by ACTS, an organization that assists children to attend school. At that time, my brothers were struggling to pay fees for my two sisters, my twin sister in high school and the other in Mombasa Polytechnic University College. Until today, my brothers are struggling to finish the fees arrears at the college. I wish to have smooth learning with no interruptions hence, I have applied for the loan. I am looking forward to studying for my Bachelor of Commerce at Strathmore University.\r\n\r\nOn graduating, I wish to work with reputable and prestigious organizations, firms or institutions like the World Bank, UN, Price Waterhouse Cooper, East African Breweries Limited (EABL) and International Finance Cooperation. I will repay the loan while I am working, not long after my graduation. My hopes and dreams of the future are: to have a reputable company of my own, to give back to society by helping out in areas such as health and sanitation, environmental conservation and to assist in children's welfare in areas such as education, health and  care. My hobbies are singing, traveling and playing basketball. \r\n

I am a partial-orphan. My father died when I was 7 years old. My family consists of my mother, my elder sister and I. I am an ambitious young man who does not allow setbacks to stop me from dreaming big. I have consistently maintained excellent academic grades since my primary school where I scored top marks which gained me a scholarship at a top National school. I have completed my secondary education at the school and attained excellent KCSE results.\r\n\r\nMy next plan is to earn the best degree from a prestigious university; Strathmore is my university of choice because it is the top ranked university in my country and a leader in the field of Business degrees. I have been admitted to start my first year of study in BBS - Actuarial Science at the school of Finance and Applied Economics.  The university emphasizes high standards of quality, excellence, respect, ethical conduct and service, besides liaising with industries and experts for the advancement of students. These excellent programs will equip me with experience and prepare me adequately for my research work.\r\n\r\nI need this loan because I would like to graduate with a well-recognized degree from the best university which will get me a fulfilling and a high paying career. I do not have any other source of funds to finance my education at Strathmore University. My mother who is the only surviving parent is unemployed.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, I plan to become one the best qualified actuaries, work for the best institutions in the Industry, clear my loans as early as possible, improve the living condition of my family and become one of the best CEOs of our time. As part of giving back to my society, I plan to found an organization through which bright needy youth will be sponsored to access education. Through this KIVA loan, I will be able to realize my dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":15450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":15450,"image":{"id":1107495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is married and lives with his family: his wife \u2013 Natia, his 8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son; the children go to school. The only source of the income for the family is a milk cow. The family consumes about half of the dairy products and the rest is sold in the village. Natia mainly produces cheese for sale. The total average monthly income of the family is 100 laris. They live below the poverty line and according to Credo estimations belong to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nDavid requested credit for start-up of a small business. A Kiva start-up loan was the only chance for him to get funds for financing the business venture. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of extremely low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit David will purchase a truck. He will collect firewood in the forest and sell it in his and nearby villages. The villagers use it for heating their house during winter, as well as spring and fall months. According to David\u2019s estimations the profit gained from this activity will equal on average 200 laris per month. The business will have a seasonal character and the income will reach its maximum in winter months. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the new business, initiated with the Kiva loan, the income of the family will significantly increase. David and Natia will use increased income for providing better living conditions for their children. In addition to the above-mentioned, the Kiva start-up loan will allow the family to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market in the future, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1107728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Bachelor of Science in Informatics degree at Strathmore University. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Lilian and I am 17 years old. I come from a single-parented family of three kids. I have two siblings: a brother and a sister.\r\n\r\nI chose Strathmore University for several reasons. First it is the best university that offers the course I want to pursue, secondly Strathmore has the best facilities and a conducive environment for studying. Such facilities include: the well-equipped library, the student centre and to top it all off, it has the best lecturers in the country. I also chose Strathmore because of its sporting activities. Most of its teams are not only recognised in the country but also in the whole of the African continent, therefore I can join one of the teams which will improve my CV and at the same time help me discover and explore my talent in the sporting sector. \r\n\r\nStrathmore Students are also very disciplined and hence their studies are not always disrupted by strikes or riots as is the case in many public universities in Kenya. Lastly I decided to choose Stathmore because of their mentorship program which helps guide the students in the right path and to make the right decisions in life since the mentors are people who have experience and they know how to deal with certain situations in life.\r\n\r\nI want to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Informatics as my undergraduate programme. I need the loan to finance my education at the university  since my mother cannot afford the fees required for the course. After graduating I would like to be employed for a few years until I have saved enough money to start my own IT company or become an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nI hope I will be able to do the course and afterwards establish my own business or company and create jobs. I also hope that I will be able to achieve all the goals I have set  in life. I would also like to thank Strathmore for giving needy but bright kids an option of still pursuing their studies, with no worries, by partnering with KIVA, and I am grateful for being accorded this chance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":15425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":15425,"image":{"id":1104094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

They all have various activities: selling chicken tamales and making napkins. Leticia is a humble and hardworking person; she has been making embroideries such as napkins and tablecloths for three years. What she likes most about her business is to welcome customers and have their orders ready on time, since her customers order napkins. She also sells various flavours of tamales: chicken, pork rib, sweetcorn jam. She makes them every three days. She says that it takes her one month to weave a tablecloth and fifteen days for a napkin. She embroiders three times a day because she has a bad back. What she likes best about this part of the business is that her mother and sisters practice the same craft. Her mother taught her when she was little and Leticia has always liked embroidery. It is the most important thing she inherited from her mother. She is very proud of her business because it is quite profitable and allows her to work doing what she loves; she works with love and dedication. One of Leticia's dreams is to see her work acknowledged and to be able to show how she makes napkins and tablecloths on her backstrap loom, which is the implement she uses the most to make her napkins. She asks for the loan in order to buy more thread, ribbons, yarn and colour thread. The members of the group thank Foundation Realidad for the help it extends to indigenous people and to people of marginalised villages.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1087491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santiago Jamiltepec Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-30T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-29T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilmelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1587.5,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22118.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419052},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11059.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568627},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11059.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399916}],"funded_date":"2012-05-31T17:38:43Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":430050,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de taller de carpinteria junto con su esposo,ella realiza trabajos de madera como mesas,sillas y puertas,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de taller de carpinteria.La socia solicita le credito para comprar herramientas y madera.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n\n","en":"The member continues working in her carpentry workshop along with her husband.

Her business was born when she came from the municipality of Malambo to the city of Barranquilla.  She was gradually making progress attracting customers, mainly in the casinos located on a commercial corridor on one of the main interdepartmental routes.  Now she is applying for her first loan, because she needs to grow and to do that she needs to find suppliers from whom she can buy in volume and on a cash basis, as they offer a better price.  This is the reason for this Kiva loan, the first loan that she has taken from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use this loan to buy raw materials, such as cooking oil, cereals and tubers.

He is very friendly, and above all hard-working. From a young age his parents taught him to earn his daily bread with the sweat of his brow, as they didn't have many financial resources. For this reason he could only go to school as far as the primary level, but would have liked to have finished school.\r\n\r\nHe is the father of three children whom he loves very much. Although they are adults, he is always attentive to them, especially to instill in them good habits. He tells us it is better to be humble but honest.\r\n\r\nHis home is located in Nazca, a city noted for having a year-round warm climate. Here we also find the Nazca lines, which are geoglyphs located in the middle of an extensive arid plain, that were used by the ancient Nazca culture as a kind of astronomic calendar for the rainy season. \r\n\r\nWhen Valentin has spare time, he likes to read and also ask his wife to prepare one of her dishes, the very delicious \u201cAdobo\u201d (pork in a spicy sauce).\r\n\r\nValentin works on his crop field with a great deal of enthusiasm. Currently, he has planted butter beans. He works on his planting around eight hours daily, as is always aware of how the crop is growing, and especially whether it has some pest infestation. He believes that things are going well in his business because he is very careful and has already been working several years in it.\r\n\r\nValentin is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help they have provided him, he will be able to buy organic and other fertilizers for maintaining his crop, especially to avoid his crop being infested with pests. This way he will be able to take good care of his crop, and especially to obtain a good harvest. This way he will be able to continue working, in order to make his greatest dream a reality: \"To have more crop fields in order to have more plantings\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1103296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and herbicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.11,"local_amount":328.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":337.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222550},{"amount":448.89,"local_amount":1171.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954342}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T21:25:39Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":430500,"name":"Perfecta Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Perfecta es una mujer de 24 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Ica, es casada y tiene 2 peque\u00f1os hijos los cuales cursan la educaci\u00f3n inicial, en sus ratos libres le gusta cocinar su comida favorita el \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d; Perfecta con mucho empe\u00f1o concluy\u00f3 sus estudios secundarios, lamentablemente por falta de recursos no puedo cursar una carrera universitaria, pero hubiera gustado poder estudiar la carrera de Enfermer\u00eda.\nPor iniciativa propia, desde hace varios a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de deliciosos postres, como son los alfajores y las cocadas, ella dedica a si negocio un aproximado de 7 horas diarias, en las cuales puede atender entre 80 y 110 clientes; ella cree que su negocio marcha bien gracias a sus delicias, experiencia y buena ubicaci\u00f3n ya que trabaja en el centro de la ciudad.\nPerfecta se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada, podr\u00e1 realizar el mejoramiento de su vivienda, ya que se acerca la \u00e9poca de invierno y desear\u00eda poder construir un cuarto adicional para sus peque\u00f1os hijos; de esta manera podr\u00e1 cumplir su gran sue\u00f1o de llegar a construir su vivienda con las comodidades que requieran para mejorar la calidad de vida de ella y su familia. \n","en":"Perfecta is a 24 year old woman, she lives in the city of Ica, she is married and has 2 small children who are in primary school and in her free time she enjoys cooking her favorite food, chicken with rice.

Only the youngest of her children, who is 16 and a secondary school student, remains under her care. \r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina started her business selling plastic products and cosmetics with the support of her husband. After working some time with her, her husband decided to travel abroad to look for better job opportunities. Carolina was left in charge of the business, and tries to run it herself as she receives support from nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe has other income in the form of the money which her husband sends to her, which he earns with the hard work he carries out abroad. Carolina sells her products in the areas surrounding Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina has requested a Kiva loan to buy merchandise such as plastic bags and cosmetics. This will help her a lot as she will be able to increase her stock and improve her sales, particularly around this period, which is Mother\u2019s Day. In the future she plans to improve the security of her business infrastructure, and her next goal is to work hard to improve her living conditions and realize her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1103321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise such as plastic bags and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina De Los Angeles \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":727,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":432542,"name":"Mamerta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Mamerta, age 74, who is a resident of Taguig City in the Philippines.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Flocerfida is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlocerfida hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLuisa maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers depend on for their income. Luisa's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 3000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nLuisa dreams of expanding her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

They would work as street vendors selling enchiladas, fried pastries, etc. and in this way she began to gain experience.  She continued working once she got married and then her mother became ill and passed away.  She decided to keep working with her sister.  With time, she saved enough to open up her own business which is a small grocery store.  She has other income since her husband receives severance pay from his job and contributes to the business and household expenses. She also sells Avon cosmetics and clothing to help her income.  Her hope is to maintain her business in her home because in this location she has many customers and to continue growing with a variety of products. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy basic products for the small grocery story such as oats, bread, rice, sugar, coffee, soap, and Mother\u2019s Day products - everything necessary to stock her business with the objective of increasing her sales so as to have greater earnings.

He has been doing this job since 2007. He lives with his wife and his four children in his small old house, which is in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe bought his plot of the land and house in 2007 and he never made any repairs or renovation to his house. He decided to make repairs to his old house. At first, he planned to insulate the walls of his house because it becomes very cold inside the house without the wall insulation, and it costs too much money for the smoky coal to get the inside of the house warm. Also, it is the worst influence on the air of the city. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters, where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Mr. Munkhbayar is taking will used to buy the building materials to make repairs and to insulate the walls of his house to reduce heat loss and

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRahiema hopes to be able to expand soon.

A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and the difference accounts for the profits that dealers depend on for their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nGeronima dreams of expanding her business in the coming years.

With everything she learned, she started her own business venture.  At first she sold beautiful Christmas decorations, and then kitchen and bathroom linens, and finally T-shirts for the Carnival festivities around the city.  The last venture became her specialty and is how she attracted her best customers.  Her sales from these ventures are conducted in the surrounding areas of her neighborhood according to each season.  She orders products that are adapted to the needs associated with a particular season.  These businesses have enabled her to contribute toward the expenses of her family, which consists of her husband and two children (ages 10 and 16).  Ibeth helps pay for improvements around her home and for her daughter's studies.  Her primary goal is to keep her children healthy, but she also has dreams of prosperity in the form of growing and stabilizing her business.  She hopes to continue generating income according to plan.  Everything she aspires for is thought of with her family in mind.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not having sufficient capital to continue the growth of her business.  For this reason, Ibeth is applying for a Kiva loan so that she can invest in the purchase of materials and supplies such as padding, fabrics, lace, thread, and buttons.  She plans to produce a large number of products and increase her sales.  By taking advantage of the second half of the year, Ibeth sees potential for growing each of her businesses.  The control over what her customers can buy rests in her hands, based on the supplies, labor, discounts, and other factors.

trabajadoras y emprendedoras.\nTodas ellas son originarias de la Ciudad de Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, una comunidad rica en gastronom\u00eda uno de sus platillos es el caldo de iguana y tacos de chicatana (hormiga roja). \nTodas las integrantes de este grupo trabajan en la central camionera de su comunidad desde hace diez a\u00f1os, que fue cuando se fundo la central.\nLa representante de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Elena de treinta y seis a\u00f1os de edad, quien se dedica a la venta de  antojitos mexicanos como enchiladas, quesadillas, pizzas y tortas.\nDice que lleva vendiendo trece a\u00f1os, y que anteriormente vend\u00eda sus antojitos mexicanos en las calles de su comunidad.\nUna de las razones por las cuales decidi\u00f3 vender comida es por que no estudi\u00f3 y no encontraba trabajo, pero necesitaba darles de comer a sus hijos ya que es madre soltera; tiene tres hijos Miguel, Rub\u00ed y Gabriel quienes les ayudan saliendo de la escuela, mientras ella esta en el puesto, ellos van a ofrecerle comida a los choferes y a los pasajeros. \nA las siete de la tarde, ya cuando es el \u00faltimo recorrido de las camionetas y se cierra la central sus hijos y do\u00f1a Elena recogen lo que utilizaron y dejan limpio para que al d\u00eda siguiente vuelva otra vez a vender y sus clientes encuentren el local limpio.\nUna de las cosas que la hacen sentir bien es la ayuda que le ha dado fundacion, ya que va a poder comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n de antojitos mexicanos.\n\nLas otras integrantes del grupo son:\n\nMaria Guadalupe- quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nGloria Itzayana-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nReynalda-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nMartha Ang\u00e9lica-quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\n\nLe

m\u00e1s personas cerca de las integrantes del grupo.

One of the traditional dishes is an iguana stew, and another is chicatana tacos (red ant tacos). \r\n\r\nAll the members of the group have worked at the central bus station in their community for over ten years, since the creation of the station. Elena is the representative of this group. She is 36 years old, and makes a living selling traditional Mexican foods, such as enchiladas, quesadillas, pizzas and tortas. She has been selling food for 13 years, and before she began working in the bus station, she sold food in the streets of her community. \r\n\r\nOne of her reasons for starting her food sales business was her lack of education and therefore her inability to find work. She was a single mother who needed a way to feed her three kids, Miguel, Rub\u00ed and Gabriel. Her children help her make and sell food when they finish school in the afternoon, and they offer food items to the drivers and passengers who pass through the terminal. \r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening, when the vans and buses make their final trips and the station closes, Elena and her children clean their food stand and the surrounding area, so that the next day their customers will find the place clean and orderly. Elena is grateful for the support she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad (Reality Foundation), and she plans to utilize the support from the loan to purchase ingredients for making traditional Mexican food dishes.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe \u2013 food sales\r\nGloria Itzayana \u2013 food sales\r\nReynalda \u2013 food sales\r\nMartha Ang\u00e9lica \u2013 food sales\r\n\r\nThe groups members are thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for their support.\r\n\r\n***This photo was taken at the bus terminal, where there are always many people buying and selling various goods, and those people appear in the background of the group photo. However, the group members are the only people who are looking at the camera (except for the girl who drinking juice; she is Maria Guadalupe\u2019s daughter. Maria Guadalupe is the woman at the far right in the photo).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1102409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients for making food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Itzayana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynalda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6895.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7272.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7572.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7933.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8325.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":521.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":543},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":597.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":494.47,"local_amount":6895.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6936.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419053},{"amount":521.53,"local_amount":7272.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7316.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568628},{"amount":119.25,"local_amount":1662.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399917},{"amount":501.56,"local_amount":6994.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7036.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407591},{"amount":949.24,"local_amount":13237.07,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":13316.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392102},{"amount":138.95,"local_amount":1937.79,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1949.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120145}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T20:01:13Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":432672,"name":"Juma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juma is married with two children who both attend school.
