All of them engage in some type of business activity.  They are all hardworking and responsible.  The members say that they are very pleased because the town of San Felipe is close to celebrating Mother's Day.  They say that the name of their group was chosen simply because it came as an idea to one of the members, whose name is not listed because that person is no longer with the group.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Saturnina is a member of this group.  She says that she is 47 years old and lives in the town of San Felipe.  Saturnina is a married woman who has been with her husband Victorino for 31 years.  He works on a construction site.  They have a family with children, but only one is a dependent even though the child is no longer in school.  Do\u00f1a Saturnina has been selling all types of clothing for five years, including trousers and shirts.  She conducts her sales by walking around the town of San Felipe and visiting her neighbors.  \"I started this business because I wanted to help my husband with the household expenses and because I enjoy walking,\" she says.  However, her greatest difficulty at the moment is having to do a great deal of walking under the sun or when it rains.  This time she is requesting a loan so that she can restock with more clothing.  She says that the loan will help her obtain more merchandise and increase her earnings considerably.  Now she will be able to buy clothes that are in style.  Her profits will help cover expenses such as food, shoes, clothing, and other needs.

On the one hand she sells cheese and dairy products retail and to small-business customers and her neighbors.  She also sells a variety of seasonal merchandise.  In other words, if her customers request things for Mother's Day, the school year, Christmas, or cultural festivals, she commits to looking for them and, as soon as she gets them, fills her requests with short-term loans. \r\n\r\nShe began her life as a merchant two years ago with the goal of working on her own and contributing to the support of her household.

Her long-term goal is to educate her children so they become successful and happy people.\r\n\r\nCurrently she plants to grow gradually.  This is why she is coming for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron las integrantes del grupo y lo eligieron ya que donde viene se llama as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n porque el lugar donde viven hay una capilla que tambi\u00e9n se llama El Calvario es donde se celebra la crucifixi\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas en Semana Santa.\n\nDo\u00f1a Elia quien es la representante del grupo nos cuenta que tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or  Juan desde hace 29 a\u00f1os de edad juntos formaron una familia con hijos e hijas pero hasta el momento ya solo tiene  un joven que ya no estudia pero aun depende de dicha pareja. Do\u00f1a Elia tiene una tortiller\u00eda y una tienda de abarrotes, su tortiller\u00eda tiene un a\u00f1o que la inicio no tiene ning\u00fan nombre nos cuenta que la dificultad que presenta con frecuencia es para comprar ma\u00edz, gas y le\u00f1a ya que est\u00e1 muy caro ya que siempre ha comprado esto  porque esto es lo fundamental para que su tortiller\u00eda siga funcionando algo  curioso que nos cuenta es que su mama fue quien le ense\u00f1o hacer tortillas tambi\u00e9n aprendi\u00f3 hacer el nixtamal para las tortillas es por eso que Su tienda tiene ya tiene 6 a\u00f1os nos comenta que la inicio ya que su esposo la apoyo mucho y la motivo para que juntos iniciaran su negocio solo que ahora su dificultad es la competencia que tiene pero no se desanima todo lo contrario fue cuando decidi\u00f3 iniciar su tortiller\u00eda. \nEsta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar ma\u00edz, gas, le\u00f1a y dulces para surtir su tienda de abarrotes nos cometa que el cr\u00e9dito le ayuda de mucho ya que cuando llega su cr\u00e9dito aprovecha para surtirse y no estar comprado cada semana.

The group meets on a hill where one can enjoy the sun in the afternoons.  The group name was chosen by the members because where they live there is a chapel that is also named El Calvario and its there that the crucifixion of Jesus is honored during Holy Week.\r\nDo\u00f1a Elia, who is the representative of the group, is 50 years old, married to Mr. Juan since she was 29 years old and together they have a family of daughters and sons.  Currently they have only one child that is no longer in school but still depends on them.  Do\u00f1a Elia has a tortilleria and a grocery store.  She started the tortilleria a year ago and it has no name.  She frequently has difficulties buying corn meal, gas and firewood because of the high prices.  These are essential items for the running of her tortilla making business.  She tells us that it was her mother that taught her how to make tortillas.  She also learned how to make the cooked maize for the tortillas.  Her store has been operating for 6 years.  She started it with her husband, who gave her a lot of support and encouraged her to open the business.  She currently has some competition but she is not discouraged by it, on the contrary, it has supported her decision to open the tortilleria.\r\nAt this time she is requesting a loan to buy maize, gas, firewood and sweets to supply her grocery store.  She comments that the loan helps her a lot since when she receives it she can stock up and does not need to purchase items every week.  Her goal is to continue to grow her two businesses, especially the store as she plans to leave it to one of her daughters so that she can have financial security.  \r\nShe uses her income to buy food, shoes and cover some household expenses.  This is of great help to her husband because they do not have to worry as much when he does not have work.\r\nDo\u00f1a Elia and the group are very grateful for the chance to invest the loan into their businesses.  Luisa,  Margarita, Petra, and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe will buy sheep to raise and fatten up for later resale; Do\u00f1a Enriqueta will buy turkeys to also fatten up and resell;  whereas Cristal will invest in perfumes, hardware and bedspreads.  Finally, Mar\u00eda Elena will buy popsicles and Alberta will purchase clothing for men and women to later sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1103151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy maize, gas, firewood, sweets, beverages, bread, milk, eggs and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Calvario, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Cristal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":78000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9750},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":696.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2090.63,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":29329.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419057},{"amount":2090.62,"local_amount":29250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29329.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568632},{"amount":1393.75,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":19552.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399921}],"funded_date":"2012-06-07T16:48:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":430919,"name":"William Leonicio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"William, padre de 5 hijos, vive en Teustepe municipio de Boaco de oficio agricultor siembra ma\u00edz y frijol , el no logro finalizar sus estudios de primarios por dedicarse a trabajar , pero sus hijos si lograron terminar la primaria.

The group members were very happy when the institution visited and they found out that they would take a group photo together. The group is made up of 7 women who live in the community of San Miguel Agua Bendita. The group members are: Manuela, Mar\u00eda Elena, and Eusebia, who will invest in raising sheep; Mar\u00eda Teresa, who will invest in sweets to sell; Sabina and Francisca, who will invest in raising chickens and turkeys; and Mar\u00eda Rosa, who is the group representative.\r\n\r\nThe women chose the group name, which means \"Winners\", because they are all women who want to triumph in their businesses and families. Their community is known for having the biggest celebration, which is the celebration of San Miguel on September 29.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Rosa is 24 years old and has been married for 4 years to her husband Jos\u00e9 Doroteo, who builds houses. Together they have two young children who are not yet in school. \r\n\r\nRosa, as she is known in the community, is very hard-working and spends the afternoons selling Mexican snacks such as corn on the cob, fried pork rinds, and toasted corn. She dresses the pork rinds with vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce, mayonnaise, and shredded cheese. To the corn on the cob she adds mayonnaise, shredded cheese, and piquin chili pepper. She dresses the toasted corn kernels with mayonnaise, chunks of chickens, epazote herb, and piquin chili pepper.\r\n\r\nRosa is requesting this loan in order to purchase everything she needs such as corn, pork rinds, mayonnaise, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, cups, spoons, etc. \r\n\r\nShe has been working in this activity for 3 years. Rosa started the business after one occasion when she accompanied her mother-in-law in selling her Mexican snacks, and when Rosa saw how well her mother-in-law sold the snacks she decided that she herself would begin to sell as well. \r\n\r\nRosa sells every afternoon; she begins preparing the snacks at noon so that they are ready for the afternoon. She carries all of her supplies on her very helpful donkey. On the weekends her husband helps her; they are the busiest days because in general families get together and purchase more. \r\n\r\nThe only difficulty Rosa faces is the purchase of gas because the gas is very expensive and the price rises every time. However, she keeps her spirits up because when she cannot buy gas she uses the firewood that is cut in her community. She also loves to sell because she can chat with all of her neighbors during the afternoons. But more than anything, her earnings help her family a lot because she can buy clothing and can save up for building her own house. Her goal is for her family to live independently, since right now they live with her parents-in-law. \r\n\r\nRosa and the other group members are very grateful for the opportunity that Kiva offers them because it will help them greatly in their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1103180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase mayonnaise, pork rinds, piquin chili peppers, avocados, tomatoes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Agua Bendita.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10521.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419058},{"amount":500,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7014.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568633},{"amount":478.81,"local_amount":6703.36,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6717.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399922},{"amount":271.19,"local_amount":3796.64,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3804.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407593}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T06:59:56Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Helvestine","image":null}},{"id":430913,"name":"Ascencion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ascensi\u00f3n, habita en la comarca Cusirisne en las afueras Teustepe, donde la agricultura y la crianza de Ganado forman parte de las actividades diarias de la gente que ah\u00ed vive.

In this community the biggest celebrations are on 31 December and 1 January, when they celebrate the arrival of the new year.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of very happy people who are grateful to the institution.  They are eight women and one man.  All of them have requested the loan to use in their businesses.  Irene will invest in her merchandise and Mar\u00eda Juana in a grocery store.  Ces\u00e1rea will buy lambs.  Josefina will invest in taxi repairs for her husband.  Eulalia will buy plastic goods to sell.  Modesta will buy scouring pads (cleaning products) to sell.  Mar\u00eda Josefina will invest in costume jewelry and Leonardo in groceries, seeds, fruits, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nCesaria, who is the representative of the group, is 54 years old and has been married to Demetrio for 30 years.  They had a family together but at the moment no longer have dependents, although they are supporting a grandson in his studies, Yosmar, who is in fourth grade.\r\n\r\nCesaria has had a grocery store for 20 years.  Up to now it has not had a name, but she is thinking about giving it one.  Cesaria says she began selling candy in her house and later thought about opening her grocery store.  The difficulty that comes up is the competition in the area where she lives.  She does not get discouraged, though, because new stores are constantly opening but later end up closing.\r\n\r\nCesaria has been working with the institution for a long time now.  This time she requested the loan to supply her grocery store; she will buy candy, soap, milk, eggs, bread, etc.\r\n\r\nThe loan has helped her a lot because she can buy enough merchandise for two or three months.  She is very grateful because her quality of life has improved with her profits, and this was one of her goals.  She invests her profits in the household expenses and on her grandson's education, among other things.\r\n\r\nShe and the group in general are very grateful for the loan granted because it will be very helpful to invest in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7150,"image":{"id":1103270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy canned goods, milk, bread, eggs, soda, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pedro El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":7150,"lender_count":197,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ces\u00e1rea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":893.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2681.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":37614.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419059},{"amount":2681.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37614.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568634},{"amount":1787.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25076.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399923}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T20:28:57Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":430975,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos es un joven con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n , es agricultor, muy  trabajador y vive en una comunidad  situada en  la zona Sur de Costa Rica, ubicada en Concepci\u00f3n de Pilas, Puntarenas, llamada La Danta.

He is married and lives with his wife, Rita, his 7-year-old daughter, and his mother. Yuri works as a worker in a local lemonade factory. He works, on average, eight hours each day and earns 250 Laris each month. Also, the family has a small piece of land for a vineyard. Most of the harvest is consumed by the family; only a small surplus is sold to the local market. The family lives below the poverty line, and they receive relevant social assistance from their local government. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerably poor category.\r\n\r\nYuri has been planning to start up a family dairy farm for one year, but he didn\u2019t have enough money. He couldn\u2019t get credit from financial institutions because of his poverty and lack of business experience. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low-income status.

The total average monthly income of the family is 350 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nIrakli is a joiner. He has a workshop, where he used to produce various items of furniture, mainly chairs. Irakli stopped working 6 months ago, as he didn\u2019t have money to purchase the wooden materials for production. He couldn\u2019t get credit from local finance institutions, because of the family\u2019s low income. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Irakli will purchase materials for the workshop. He will re-start production of chairs and sell them through networks that he already knows; mainly in furniture stores in nearby towns. The income of the family will increase by approximately 110% and they will be able to improve their living conditions. Irakli also plans to reinvest part of the profit in the workshop, so he can diversify the products he makes.

In the photo she is seen in the box at the upper left. She works in the woven handicraft sector and has run her business for seven years. She works Mondays to Friday. She is the one who sometimes goes to visit her customers' homes.\r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise she needs in the city of Concepci\u00f3n, and other times in the city of Puerto Montt. With the loan she will buy wool. Her business goals are to have her own shop for better serving her clientele.\r\n\r\nKatty lives with her husband and her four children, and one of her dreams is to fulfill herself as a woman and to give her children a very good education.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her, as it has allowed her to invest in her business. As well, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank group, as they share various activities and interests. It has also served as an enjoyable activity for her. With the training provided in the meetings she has learned to run her business better.\r\n\r\nChiguayante is a commune located in the south of Chile, near the city of Concepci\u00f3n, in Biob\u00edo region. Its name comes from mapudungun (mapuche language) and means \u201csun through mist\". Due to its mountainous surroundings it has a temperate maritime climate. Its economic activity is mainly commercial.\r\n\r\nChiguayante had been created as a commune in 1925, but for various reasons it later joined with Concepci\u00f3n. Its existence in that period lasted less than two years. In 1996 it was again created as a commune, and remains so to the present day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6725,"image":{"id":1104232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":6725,"lender_count":219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Honoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":3406814,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":394187},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":406353},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":414109},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":422011},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":430067},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":438278},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":446644},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":455165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":802.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":817.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":848.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":865.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":881.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":898.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3230.74,"local_amount":1636660,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1638309.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430185},{"amount":1714.1,"local_amount":868345,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":869220.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332959},{"amount":1780.16,"local_amount":901809,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":902717.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878980}],"funded_date":"2012-06-04T07:38:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":432747,"name":"Romeo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Romeo lives in the village of Lapankuri, Kakheti Region. He is fifty-seven years old, single, and lives alone. Romeo works as a watchman in a local private dairy farm. His monthly salary is 100 Laris. Romeo owns 0.6 hectares of land, where he grows maize. In the spring and summer months he works hard on his cornfield during daytime and in the evening he goes to the farm, where he stays till morning. According the Credo estimations he belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nRomeo needs money to purchase fertilizers for the cornfield. He tilled the land in April and sowed maize. If he doesn\u2019t use fertilizers, he will get a low quality harvest and will have to sell it for cheap price, which won\u2019t bring any profit. Romeo will also use some part of the credit to purchase piglets to set-up a small pig farm. He wasn\u2019t able to receive the requested loan from local financial institutions, because his income was too small to qualify for regular loan products. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Romeo will purchase fertilizers and use them in the cornfield. He will work hard on the plot during the summer to get good harvest. After selling the harvest, Romeo will get profit. Also his piglets will grow and in 7-8 months he will already have 2 pigs, which will give him approximately 18 piglets per year for sale. Romeo will have his own business and his monthly income will significantly improve. The Kiva start-up loan will allow him to improve his living conditions.

She has never taken out a loan from a state bank before, but FUDECOSUR has offered her a loan with ease and at a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1105629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to care for her coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Oratorio, Platanarares, Perez zeledon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2012-05-31T22:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-30T22:00:09Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.11,"local_amount":13554.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":13662.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515850},{"amount":110.17,"local_amount":55083.29,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":55523.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356674826},{"amount":35.93,"local_amount":17964.24,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18107.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365070536},{"amount":27.12,"local_amount":13560.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13668.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373132419},{"amount":17.27,"local_amount":8633.53,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8702.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381937626},{"amount":7.67,"local_amount":3832.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813369},{"amount":19.8,"local_amount":9898.27,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":9977.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089253},{"amount":554.93,"local_amount":277473.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":279693.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728545}],"funded_date":"2012-06-13T07:48:39Z","paid_date":"2014-01-20T09:56:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":431062,"name":"Sayhua Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSAYHUA\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Urubamba, perteneciente a la provincia de Urubamba y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Tamaz\u2019s mother has chronic health problems and receives the relevant pension from the local government. Total average monthly income of the family is 400 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category.\r\n\r\nTamaz needs a loan for sowing maize on the  family owned 0.5 hectare land and to start-up a pig farm. He couldn\u2019t get regular agricultural credit from local financial institutions as the income of the family is too small. Tamaz\u2019s loan request was approved because of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received loan, Tamaz will purchase fertilizers, till the land, fertilize it and sow maize. He will work hard on the plot during the summer to get a good harvest. After selling the harvest, he will get profit. With part of the credit, Tamaz will also purchase a pig for setting up a pig farm. He will be able to sell piglets after four months. Through the above mentioned investment Tamaz\u2019s income will increase and he will be able to improve the living conditions of the family.

He learned this trade from his mother, who is also a merchant.  He has a business selling cold cuts and also selling low cost novelty items, including flashlights, cell phone cases, cellular phones, etc.  He buys his cold cuts in the municipality of Galapa, where he lives with his wife and their two children aged 4 and 2 months.  He acquires his merchandise in the city of Barranquilla, located 20 minutes from his city.  Most of his customers are found in the municipalities of Sabanalarga, Las Pe\u00f1as, Aguada, San Pablo, and also in Galapa.  He sells on credit, and his customers pay over a period of between 15-30 days.  With the income that comes from his sales, he supports his household.  For this reason, he wants to grow his business so that he can provide his family with greater comfort, and can strengthen his family's future.  For the future, his goal is to have his own house, where he could locate his expanded business.  His main challenge is having enough working capital to buy and take advantage of special pricing.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan.  He will use this loan to buy cold cuts and novelty products.

He says he is happy to finally be able to offer his hometown a way of sending and receiving money that is easy, safe and affordable. When asked what challenges he faces in his business, he points to the fact that he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers. He goes on to explain that this is especially a challenge for him because his hometown of Kalabo has no banking services, and so when he runs out of cash, he has no choice but to electronically send all his working capital to a nearby town called Mongu, and have someone send some cash to him via a speed boat. This can take about two hours and he is charged a fee of K 50,000 (about $10). This is money that is meant to be his profit. He fears that should it happen that a boat capsizes, he would lose all his working capital.\r\n\r\nMuyoyeta is hopeful that once he gets his Kiva loan, he will be able to serve more customers without the risk of losing all his money and earn more profits to help him finish his education and give a better life to his young family.\r\n\r\nIn the video, Muyoyeta is being interviewed by a

They live in a small and very peaceful area where the people earn their living growing corn. The group's members tell the story that they chose the name because they got it from the Bible. They are not entirely sure what it means, but they like it. It has to do with an evangelical name and the members believe it was a person who organized musicians. They tell us that the place where they live, San Agust\u00edn Mextepec, celebrates the day the evangelist came to the place. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Agustina, who is one of the group's representatives, says that she is 54 years old and has been married for forty years to Juan who works in the countryside although he is also a merchant. Do\u00f1a Agustina earns a living selling household products and mentions that she began by selling from neighborhood to neighborhood, carrying the products in her arms, but now her situation has changed since she has some very well-established stands. Do\u00f1a Agustina has requested the loan in order to purchase more merchandise such as blender jars, knives, scissors, clotheslines, gloves, buckets, brushes, etc. \r\n\r\nAgustina comments that the difficulty that presents itself is when the delegates, or leaders of the plaza, don't allow her to sell as she wishes since if one doesn't sell for two or three days they may take one's spot away. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Agustina would like her two daughters, although they are still in school, to practice the profession they like the most. For example, her daughter Diana would like to be a nurse or doctor, and her other daughter, Esmeralda, would like to be a teacher in order to instruct children. Agustina says that she will help them as much as she can. She also would like for the kitchen she hired someone to build to be finished soon so she may try it out for the first time. \r\n\r\nThe group's other members are: Raquel who will invest in blender jars, Maria Angelica who will invest in blender jars and bases, Felisa who will purchase canvas of various sizes and colors, Emma who will invest in sewing supplies and Norma in blender jars and sewing supplies. \r\n\r\nThey are all very grateful and happy to have received the loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":1105761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase blender jars, cutlery, clotheslines, cleaning clothes, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":24087.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419066},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568640},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16058.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399930},{"amount":575,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8029.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407597}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T23:34:00Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":431056,"name":"Raul Gerardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Raul de 39 a\u00f1os de edad esposo y padre, vive en casa propia y se esfuerza d\u00eda a d\u00eda para mantener a su peque\u00f1a y unida familia, mantener su hogar y mas que nada mantener la felicidad al lado de su familia, se dedica a la venta  de art\u00edculos varios de segunda mano tales como son televisores hornos de microondas, l\u00e1mparas, electrodom\u00e9sticos en general entre otros.

Gregorio is pleased with what has transpired over the years and that his work attracts customers.  He produces all types of products made of wood (beds, chairs, wardrobes, doors, drawers, tables, windows, and armchairs).  Some people rave about his beautiful work.

She is forty-nine years old and married with nine children: three daughters and six sons. She now still has eight children to take care of. Two of them are in school while the others work in the family's business. To support their big family, Thorng and her husband have been farming two hectares of cassava farmland and one hectare of rice fields for the past several years. Thorng also raises pigs on-site to gain extra income. Her main challenge is the drop of cassava's price.\r\n\r\nThorng has been with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, for four loan cycles and successfully paid the past loans. These loans have helped her afford to buy more piglets and also keep her children in school. The other member of Thorng's group just joined VisionFund this loan cycle.

She has made a living selling cosmetics for 3 years. She started her business with jobs that her co-workers gave her, and with the little she earned she stocked her small cosmetics sales business. That's how she started gaining experience. Her style of work is door to door because her customers put in their orders ahead of time.

In order to renovate her work area she applied for a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

They aim to increase their yields so they have the income to meet their daily needs and pay for their children's education. Leonor and her husband have plans to expand their planted corn to ensure high production, but they have not been able to do so because they cannot afford it. So, Leonor is requesting an additional P35,000 to buy corn seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides needed in corn farming. This loan will enable she and her husband to expand their planting. They are hoping to have a fruitful harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1092209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn seeds, fertilizers and pesticides needed in corn farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.
