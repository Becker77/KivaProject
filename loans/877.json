Issa, unable to continue with his education, quickly started in the profession of metal working at a young age, a job he has been doing for over 9 years. He has been working with 3 apprentices in his own workshop for about 2 years and is sought after by most of his customers because of the quality of his workmanship.\r\n\r\nTo be able to better respond to the expectations of his customer base, which keeps growing, Issa is requesting this 3rd individual loan from Soro Yiriwaso. The 2 previous loans were correctly repaid. He plans to use this new loan to buy 5 bars of 'U' iron, 5 bars of 'Z' iron, 4 packets of rods, 5 sheets of metal and 4 rolls of wire. He buys his material from the ironmongers in town before creating products (chairs, tables, benches, etc.) for resale.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Issa expects to make a monthly profit of 150 000 francs, which will be used to contribute to the family expenditures, to pay off the interest from his loan and to reinvest in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1092529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural

She lives in a traditional family in a neighborhood of Segou called Hamdallaye A.\r\n\r\nFor social reasons, Korotoumou never attended school (her parents believed that sending girls to school was a waste for society), so she got involved in income-generating activities very early in life and started helping her mother who was selling clothes.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou spent several years learning her trade from her mother.  Then she started to sell various goods, before finally getting into buying and selling colorful printed fabrics and traditionally woven cloths.  She has been involved in this activity for the past 23 years.  She is very experienced in her field and has many customers.\r\n\r\nEager to boost her business and to increase her profits, she is requesting this new loan.

She lives in a traditional family setting with her husband and other couples in the district of Bagadadji, in S\u00e9gou. Due to social reasons (she comes from a family with well-established ancestral values), she did not go to school and became involved in revenue-generating activities at a young age, selling rice alongside her mother in the rice producing region of M\u2019Bewani in the Niger Office zone. After several years of apprenticeship, she started working alone, selling products like clothing, firewood, cereal, fruit juice, yoghurt and incense. She ended up deciding to specialise in the sale of yoghurt and the production and sale of fruit juice, which she has been doing for 5 years now and has a significant customer base.\r\n\r\nTo make her juice she needs 10 kilos of sugar, 12 sachets of powdered juice, 20 sachets of valine sugar and 6 kilos of ginger. In order to be able to get a new freezer and to strengthen her business, she is requesting this new loan. She has been with Soro Yiriwaso for 12 months, having already repaid an individual loan. This is her second loan, which she plans to use to buy a freezer and 2 bags of sugar. She gets her supplies locally.\r\n\r\nAminata sells her products for cash to a mixed retail clientele. With this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 150 000 francs which will enable her to replay the loan and carry out other revenue-generating activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1094376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

According to Aurea, she wants to give a good future to all her children since she doesn\u2019t want them to be like her and not pursue their schooling. \r\n\r\nAurea ventured into the hog-raising business five years ago. She sells grown-up hogs and earns income from it. She hopes that her business will further expand by raising more hogs. She seeks assistance from Kiva lenders who can help her improve and maintain her piggery. Aurea is asking to borrow a loan of PHP 10,000 as her additional capital to buy feed and additional hogs to raise. It will surely help her in making her business progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1095062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They know each other through family, marriage and neighborhood ties.\r\n\r\nThese women buy and sell rice, wax and damask fabrics, and various other goods such as tea, pasta etc.  Eager to meet their customers' increasing needs, they have joined Soro Yiriwaso and this is their tenth solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nStanding first from the left in the photo, Awa is an important seller of all grades of \"bazin\" or damask fabrics, in the village of S\u00e8m\u00e8bougou as well as in the surrounding areas.  She is planning to use her loan to buy seven sets of \"bazin\" fabrics, all printed differently.  She buys damask fabrics from dyers in S\u00e9gou and resells them for cash or on credit to a customer base which, in her village, consists of both men and women.  She also sells as an itinerant retailer in nearby villages, as well as at the market by the S\u00e9gou water tower.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Awa is expecting average monthly profits to reach 70,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in her business and also used to pay her children's school fees and to buy the condiments that her family needs.  Like the other women of the group, her goal is to use her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso to buy a plot of land in her commune's main town, to eventually build a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1095201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy damask fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e8m\u00e8bougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T07:01:54Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:54Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1125000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":187500},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":187500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":733.33,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":375067.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411157},{"amount":366.67,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":187533.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449286},{"amount":366.67,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":187533.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502974},{"amount":366.66,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":187533.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268607},{"amount":366.67,"local_amount":187500,"processed_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":187533.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498989}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T02:42:45Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":426000,"name":"Tina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tina, from Capatan, has a business selling fruits and vegetables to the people in her village.

Bety owns the house in which she lives.  There she spends her days along with her partner, who works just as hard as she does, so that they can provide a better quality of life.\n\nBety's business involves selling groceries.  She buys in bulk because the prices are more affordable and then sells at retail prices.  In addition to this, she rents out motorcycle taxis.  One is driven by her son and the other is rented out, but she generates income from both of them.  Bety has been in business for four years and works by herself since her partner engages in other activities.  Her work enables her to make use of her time as she sees fit.  It was not easy for her to start her business because of the doubts and fears that she held, but she slowly gained more strength and now is very good at what she does.  Bety set a goal to expand her store and offer more products to her customers.  \n\nThis will be her 16th loan with MFP.  Bety is pleased to know that she has financial support, which makes her feel more confident about advancing her business.  She promises once again, just like her previous loans, to complete her payments.  Bety also likes working with the other members of her Communal Bank because they are responsible and supportive.

He is married with children ages 18 and 24. He is a high-school graduate. For the past four years, he has been operating a drugstore.

For the past ten years, she has been running a provision shop, which sells rice, soap, toothpaste, oil, tissue, milk, batteries, and many other items. She says some problems she is facing are the location of her shop and having fewer commodities. She started this business with help from her mother and learned this way of business from her mother. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory (rice, soap, toothpaste, oil, tissue, milk, batteries, and many other items) for her shop. She says that she is happy about her business for so many reasons: it keeps her busy, it builds her trust, and it makes her well-known (every one in her community looks up to her for help if the community needs it). She smiles as she says her plan is to expand her business and empower others with her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1097036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She uses her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has been using her sewing skills to generate additional income for the family by meeting custom orders for the past 6 years. Galawezh would like to improve her work conditions by renovating the work area, creating a more pleasant atmosphere for both herself and her customers. To do the repair work, Galawezh took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq as a member of a group.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Her business is located within a town and her primary customers are people who come to visit the town.
