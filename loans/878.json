She does all this single handedly.\n\nShe will use the loan to buy goats to sell, to buy more stock for the retail business and use some of the money to pay school fees. Her main customers are neighbors and passersby. The main challenge is theft around the village. Sometimes thieves steal her goats after she has invested her money in them, especially the loan money, and this affects her cash flow. Sometimes she or her children fall sick and on those days she is unable to work on her land.

She normally gets the fish caught by her husband who goes fishing along Tonle Sap River every single day.

Hin is now 52 years old and has five single children. \r\n\r\nHin wants to get involved in a hog-raising business for extra income.

","en":"Reinaldo is 21 years old; he has a recording studio and has sold music including some singles. He is also a salesman and sells various products to his customers who give him orders and pay him by quotas that they set up with him. Music is a very important part of Reinaldo\u2019s life; it makes him see life differently and has helped him mature. This is why he is supporting other young people who dream about being musicians and believes that feeling the music helps many stay away from some of society\u2019s bad influences. Reinaldo\u2019s greatest wish is to have a recording studio to help people who are starting out musically and to each day improve his life and self. At present, he needs a credikiva that will be used to buy a microphone, a control panel and recording equipment as well as merchandize to meet his customers\u2019 orders of clothing and women\u2019s accessories that have been made by his best customers; this will help him gain their loyalty even more. Reinaldo believes that this credikiva is an investment to his success because it will increase the possibilities for him to edit quality work and his commercial experience has taught him to sell only

For the last six years he has been living in his uncle's apartment in Yerevan. The owners of the apartment, where he lives moved abroad several years ago. Mikayel's parents and his cadet sibling live in a village, where they have their own house and a farm.\r\n\r\nMikayel operates a rented shop, where he trades mobile accessories and sun glasses. He also repairs mobile telephones in the same shop. The shop is located in a very crowded area and hence Mikayel has many customers.

The family is involved in agriculture: farming and beekeeping. The village is located in a mountainous region, and it requires additional costs in order to meet challenges connected with weather conditions. This means that Armenuhi can't make savings to invest in land cultivation. \r\n\r\nArmenuhi has applied for this loan to start and complete land cultivation.

El nombre del grupo se eligi\u00f3 hace tiempo, las integrantes lo adaptaron porque algunas de ellas ya estaban una asociaci\u00f3n anterior con el mismo nombre. A pesar de no conocer con exactitud porqu\u00e9 se eligi\u00f3 ese nombre en un inicio, todas piensan que es porque el lugar en donde viven hay muchos manantiales peque\u00f1os donde las personas van a traer el agua para beber o para lavar.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, un miembro del grupo, comenta que tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Fernando, quien todas las tardes se dedica a raspar el maguey para hacer el tradicional pulque. Hace mas de 30 a\u00f1os  que est\u00e1n juntos; ellos formaron una familia, pero solo 2 de sus hijos siguen viviendo con ellos y aunque ya no estudian, siguen dependiendo de dicha pareja.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda se dedica a la crianza de borregos, actividad en la cual ya tiene 30 a\u00f1os. Tambi\u00e9n tiene una tienda de abarrotes, la cual abri\u00f3 hace 20 a\u00f1os aproximadamente. Explica que la crianza de borregos la adopt\u00f3 ya que su mam\u00e1 le dio dos borreguitos que ella tuvo que cuidar, fue entonces que aprendi\u00f3 todo lo relacionado con el engocio y decidi\u00f3 iniciar la actividad. La tienda la puso posteriormente ya que sus hijos y esposo la motivaron para iniciarla y ellos mismos le ayudaron econ\u00f3micamente.\n\nEsta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar 5 borregos y surtir su tienda de abarrotes para la cual tiene planeado comprar productos enlatados, refrescos, golosinas, pan, huevo, leche, etc. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida con el cr\u00e9dito ya que le servir\u00e1 volver a surtir su tienda (desde hace tiempo le faltaban varios productos). \n\nEn sus actividades, Mar\u00eda no tiene dificultades ya que sus borregos est\u00e1n en muy buenas condiciones y la tienda est\u00e1 mejorando poco a poco. La meta que tiene do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda es arreglar su tiendita ya que solo tiene maderas para colocar su producto y es techado, le gustar\u00eda tener su tienda colada y estantes grandes para sus productos. Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda tener m\u00e1s borregos, todo esto para que su calidad de vida mejore.

In order to get to their meeting place, the members must travel a long distance on foot since it is impossible for any form of transportation to reach this site.  The name of the group was chosen a long time ago.  The members adopted this name because some of them previously belonged to another group with the same name.  Even though they do not know the exact reason why they chose this name, they all believe that it is because the place where they live has many small springs where people can draw water for drinking and bathing.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, a member of the group, says that she is 51 years old and married to Sr. Fernando.  Every evening, she scrapes the leaves of the agave plant in order to make traditional \"pulque\" (a fermented beverage).  Mar\u00eda and her husband have been together for more than 30 years.  They formed a family, but only two of their children are dependents who continue to live with them even though they are no longer in school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda has been raising sheep for 30 years.  She also has a grocery store that she opened approximately 20 years ago.  Mar\u00eda explains she began raising sheep when her mother gave her two lambs to care for.  It was then that she learned everything about the business and decided to start one of her own.  The store was established later on after her children and husband convinced her to start it.  They also help out financially.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan in order to buy five heads of sheep and to restock her grocery store with canned goods, soft drinks, candies, bread, eggs, milk, and other items.  She is pleased and grateful that the loan will help to replenish the inventory of her store since she lacks various products.  In her activities, Mar\u00eda has no difficulties with her sheep since they are kept in very good conditions and her store is improving gradually.  Her goal is to remodel her store since it only has planks of wood for displaying her products and a roof.  She would like for her store to have larger shelves for storing her products.  Mar\u00eda would also like to have more sheep so that she can improve her quality of life.  Overall she is very pleased because she is always able to reinvest her earnings in her businesses.  She is also able to pay for the household expenses and cover her loan payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda and the rest of her group and very happy with and appreciative of Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC) because they will be able to invest in their various livestock activities.

David used to live in the town of San Luis, Antioquia, but due to violence in the area he had to move to another city and begin a new life.  At first, there were very few opportunities and he did not receive support from anyone toward finding a job and earning an income for his household.  But one day he decided to set up his own business selling clothing, which is how he currently earns a living.  \r\n\r\nDavid works in the center of town and for many years kept requesting a permit to work as a street vendor.  Approximately five years ago they gave him the permit and since then he works at a fixed location which is easy for customers to find.

He also hopes that with greater income his family can enjoy a better quality of life and he can realize his dream of giving his three children a good education.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1082335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy concrete materials to build his store and expand the products he sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Fredonia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo Leon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89280},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91785},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94361},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97008},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":99731},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":102529},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105406},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":108364},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":111405},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":114531},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117745},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121049},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124446},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":127938},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131528},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":135219},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139013},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142914},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":146924},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":151047},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":155285},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159643},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164123},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":168726}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":429756,"name":"Kholoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kholoud is a conservative woman.

Some of his children devote themselves to growing basic grains.  They are a tenacious and united family.  His children continually contribute to supporting the family. \r\n\r\nJuan sells basic needs products, he is a coffee grower, and he also devotes himself to sawing lumber.  He started his grocery store three years ago.  He works in the business supported by his wife and with help from his children.  The business is open from 7:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.  One of the disadvantages is that in the months of July and August his sales decrease and consequently his income decrease.\r\n\r\nJuan needs the loan he is requesting to buy basic needs products like sugar, rice, lard, soft drinks, soap, salt, meat, and detergent, among others.

He started buying pigs to butcher and sell the meat to grocery stores and butcheries.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of the business is that it is very profitable, and this has allowed him to support his family, although with many financial limitations. One of the disadvantages is that the market is saturated with people who do the same kind of work and some of them, in order to sell their products quickly, do so at such low prices that he is unable to compete.\r\n\r\nWith the support this loan gives him he hopes to have sufficient profits to support his household and to buy school supplies, uniforms and shoes that his children need to go to school.\r\n\r\nHis fellow group member, Iris, sells snacks.

The father of her children abandoned them a long time ago, which left her in charge of all of the household obligations.\r\n\r\nWith the motive of generating income to support the household, she took advantage of the experience she had working in a restaurant.  Approximately six years ago she decided to establish her own cafeteria, where she provides very good service to her customers.  Thanks to the great clientele that she has, a sister of hers helps her work in order to be able to provide good service in the cafeteria.\r\n\r\nThanks to this business she has managed to generate sufficient income to be able to give her three children a better quality of life and a good quality education.  She is so perseverant so that the business continues growing.  This way she continues to provide her children with good opportunities.\r\n\r\nBecause the business does not have a lot of capital, Yuri is looking for a loan to buy a refrigerator for the cafeteria.  She will also buy stock to provide her customers with a greater variety of products.\r\n\r\nThis way her business will continue to always provide good service, and, little by little, she will get more customers.  This will allow her income to increase, and she will fulfill her dream of having a great business and of getting her three children ahead.  She will be providing them with a good education and a good quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1084119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

A friend taught her this skill and now she has a business that generates household income for covering all of the expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe main advantage that she has, which is a difficulty for Maria at the moment, is the large amount of work that she has been given.  Due to the financial difficulties at home, she does not have sufficient funds to purchase another machine and provide employment for another person.  Therefore, she often works long hours to the point of physical exhaustion.  Encouraged by the chance to improve her condition, and with the help of a sister who started working with her, Maria is seeking a loan in order to purchase an upright machine.  This will provide the equipment she needs to employ another family member.  As a result, she will be able to work under better conditions and gradually develop a more productive business.  In addition, Maria will enjoy a better quality of life and help her family gradually make progress in overcoming life's adversities.

En un principio Erika trabajaba en un taller de confecci\u00f3n donde perfeccion\u00f3 su trabajo y as\u00ed mont\u00f3 su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n donde ofrec\u00eda el servicio de confecci\u00f3n a terceros; luego, gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos logr\u00f3 tener muy buenas ventas y as\u00ed poder tener el capital suficiente con el cual mont\u00f3 su l\u00ednea propia de prendas de vestir. Actualmente, Erika trabaja \u00fanicamente su l\u00ednea propia gracias a que tiene muy buenas ventas y su capacidad de producci\u00f3n se encuentra totalmente dirigida a la confecci\u00f3n de los pedidos de su l\u00ednea propia; sin embargo, cuenta con la dificultad de que no ha tenido el capital suficiente con el cual pueda comprar una m\u00e1quina resortadora, por lo que le toca dirigirse hasta otro barrio de la ciudad donde le prestan este servicio y as\u00ed debe incurrir en gastos extras en su producci\u00f3n. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Erika busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina resortadora y as\u00ed poder tener todo lo necesario para la producci\u00f3n de sus prendas de vestir y no tener que incurrir en gastos extras en su producci\u00f3n.\nDe esta manera Erika podr\u00e1 ahorrar una gran cantidad de dinero en desplazamiento y en pagar por el servicio que le prestan con la m\u00e1quina resortadora, por lo que sus ingresos mensuales se ver\u00e1n en aumento y as\u00ed su negocio seguir\u00e1 saliendo adelante. Erika sue\u00f1a con tener un gran taller donde pueda generar empleo para m\u00e1s personas y as\u00ed cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser una gran empresaria, para lo cual ha trabajado fuertemente. \n","en":"\r\nErika, 20, is a young entrepreneur who decided to open her own business aimed at generating her own income to be able to contribute economically to her household\u2019s expenses.  \r\n\r\nAbout five years ago she learned dressmaking from an aunt and since then has been working hard at this activity leading to her having very good experience.  At the beginning, Erika worked at a dressmaking shop where she honed her skills and then set up her own shop where she\u2019d sew for third parties.  \r\n\r\nLater, thanks to the good quality of her products she managed to have very good sales and gather enough capital to start her own line of clothes.  Currently, Erika works exclusively in her own line because she has good sales and her production capacity is totally directed to filling orders of her own line.  However, she has the difficulty that she\u2019s not had sufficient capital to buy a double stitch machine which means she has to go to a different neighborhood in the city where she can avail herself of this service thus incurring extra production costs.\r\n\r\nAiming to improve this situation, Erika is looking for financing to be able to buy a double stitch machine to be able to have everything needed for the production of her articles of clothing and not incur additional production costs.\r\n\r\nIn this way Erika will be able to save a large amount of money in transportation costs and in paying to be leant a double stitch machine so her monthly income will increase and her business will continue getting ahead.\r\n\r\nErika dreams with having a large shop where she can generate employment for other people thus reaching her dream of becoming a great businesswoman for which she\u2019s been working so hard.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1085783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She comes from a family of scarce financial resources, which has led her, from a young age, to seek work and consistent employment. She began working six years ago at a small general store, but was not paid very well. In hopes of earning a decent wage, she decided to save up as much money as possible to open her own business. Five months ago, she opened her own general store, where she offers customers a wide range of products.

His dream is to have a very well-stocked store so that residents of his rural neighborhood won\u2019t have to travel to the cities to shop but rather will find everything they need in his store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1088976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Olaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oliver De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54535},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":56065},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57639},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59256},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60919},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62628},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":64386},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66193},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":68050},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":69959},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71923},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73941},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76016},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78149},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80341}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":423112,"name":"Jairo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jairo es una persona muy trabajadora que siempre ha querido brindarle a su familia una buena calidad de vida, es por esto que trabaja fuertemente en su negocio todos los d\u00edas para brindarles unos ingresos con los cuales puedan sostener todos sus gastos. \n\n\nTiene una miscel\u00e1nea en el parque de su municipio la cual ha sido reconocida por sus clientes por la buena atenci\u00f3n que presta, y gracias a que tiene muchos pedidos de sus clientes, Jairo busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita comprar surtido de productos de uso dom\u00e9stico, papeler\u00eda, entre otros, para poder ofrecer una mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes.\n\n\nDe esta manera sus ingresos aumentar\u00e1n considerablemente y su familia podr\u00e1 gozar de una mejor calidad de vida y mayores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"Jairo is a very hard-working person who has always wanted to provide his family with a good quality of life.

She had spent many years in this line of work, and when she began to work from home she taught this trade to her husband.  Afterwards, Aristides began to work alongside her, and ever since he separated from his wife 8 years ago, he has been left in charge of the sewing workshop.  With this business, he has generated the income needed to support the expenses of his household, where he lives with his 2 children.\r\n\r\nIn his workshop, he mainly produces school uniforms for the schools in his area.  Thanks to this work, he is able to have a large quantity of orders, requiring him to transport a large quantity of garments.  Because of this, his transportation expenses have been mounting.  So Aristides is seeking a loan that will allow him to purchase a used vehicle to economically transport his garments and avoid the high shipping costs that he is currently paying.\r\n\r\nIn this way, his business will become more efficient and he will be able to increase his sales.  Also, he hopes that with a higher income, his children will be able to have a better quality of life and greater opportunities for economic progress.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1089830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a vehicle to transport his garments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aristides ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":74502},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":76584},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78725},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80925},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83187},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85512},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":87903},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":90360},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":92885},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":95481},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98150},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100894},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":103714},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":106613},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":109593},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":112656},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":115805},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119041},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":122369},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125789},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":129305},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":132919},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136634},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140454}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":431301,"name":"Baheera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baheera is a 50-year-old housewife.
