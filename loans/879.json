Her dream is to eventually have a locale where she can offer restaurant services, generate employment and provide economic stability for her home.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1089925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy an industrial size pot and ingredients to prepare food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64182},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65972},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67811},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69702},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71646},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73643},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75697},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":77807},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":79977},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82207},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84499},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":431132,"name":"Khalil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalil is a person who has had to overcome many adversities in his life.

She is married and the mother of a seven-year-old child.  Yolanda works as a foster mother at a government institution that supports children who have been abandoned by their parents.  Thanks to the income she earns, she has been able to contribute financially to the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nApproximately two years ago, her husband was in an accident, so Yolanda was obligated to generate all of the household income by herself.  She took advantage of her ability to make handicrafts out of \"guadua\" (a type of bamboo that is native to the Amazon region) and began manufacturing products in large quantities that she could sell.  Her first few customers consisted of relatives and friends, but thanks to the good quality of her work, her sales have increased considerably.  Yolanda is encouraged by the large number of orders from her customers, so she is seeking a loan in order to buy supplies and materials needed for making her bamboo crafts.  As a result, she will be able to respond to the many orders submitted by her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan will enable her to continue growing her business and generating income for her family so that they can enjoys a better quality of life.  Her seven-year-old son will have access to a good-quality education.  Yolanda dreams of moving forward in her business and acquiring her own location where she can set up a stand for selling her products directly.

Her husband died some time ago, so she was left in charge of the household obligations.  Some of her children are already grown and able to get a job to help pay for their own studies.  A long time ago, Rosa started a business selling \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a>\" (flat cornbread served with various fillings).  This was her primary means of earning money, but when her husband died, she was obligated to acquire an additional source of income.  She set up a mobile kiosk for selling candy at the main park in the city.  With these businesses, Rosa is able to generate enough income to maintain the household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince she has great difficulty accessing capital, Rosa is seeking a loan in order to repair the mobile kiosk she has owned for approximately eight years and to buy a grain mill motor so that she can process corn for making \"arepas\".

His wife abandoned them some time ago, and does not contribute to helping raise their son. Heriberto was working at a job that did not pay him sufficient income to cover his family\u2019s living expenses, so he decided to open a general store. Since he did not have very much startup capital, his shelves are made out of wooden planks and his inventory is scarce.

She has always liked hands-on work, a trend that has led her to sell crafts for birthday parties and surprises. She is a single mother, and provides her family's only source of income. She works from 7:00 am until 11:00 pm, Monday through Saturday. Her sales are typically down in winter, since streets are less navigable due to bad weather, and less people are out and about. \r\n\r\nShe has two children, ages 7 and 11, both of whom are in school. She is requesting this loan in order to purchase materials for making her crafts, including foam, paint and molds. One of her goals is to convert an empty space she has in her house into a larger workshop for her business. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1093494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase foam, paint and molds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Beronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":97.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":102.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":104.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":107.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":120.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":424925,"name":"Gs Las Delicias Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Se\u00f1ora Santos, tiene 60 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 1 hijo y es madre soltera, Su actividad principal es la venta de abarroter\u00eda (pulper\u00eda) desde hace m\u00e1s de 5 A\u00f1os, Do\u00f1a Santos, esta solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de productos como: az\u00facar, manteca, jab\u00f3n, refrescos, carnes, papel higi\u00e9nico, ma\u00edz, frijoles y otros productos para la buena atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes, ya que al tener su negocio ubicado en su hogar le permite realizar a su vez oficios dom\u00e9sticos sin descuidar su hogar y de esta manera tambi\u00e9n puede atender a sus clientes, con el apoyo solicitado del pr\u00e9stamo que reciba Do\u00f1a Santos, le contribuir\u00e1 a tener un mejor negocio, y as\u00ed obtener mejores ingresos para cubrir los gastos en el hogar y darle una mejor calidad de vida a su familia, y ayudarla a salir adelante, ella trabaja afanosamente  para manejar todo en orden en su hogar y negocio.\nDo\u00f1a Santos uno de sus sue\u00f1os es ampliar su  negocios y vender una variedad de producto, gracias al apoyo que se le brinde subir\u00eda un pelda\u00f1o para lograr su sue\u00f1o.\nLa Se\u00f1ora Haydee, se dedica al comercio, su actividad principal es la venta de Cosm\u00e9ticos.\nLa Se\u00f1ora Maritza, se dedica al comercio y su actividad principal es la venta de granos b\u00e1sicos.\nDanli El Para\u00edso, Honduras - Abril 2012\n","en":"Santos is 60 years old, has one son, and is a single mother.

For about the past three years, she had been working in a store selling clothing, but because her salary was not enough to contribute greatly to the expenses of her household, she decided to go independent and create her own business.\r\n\r\nThus, about three years ago, she opened an internet cafe where she provides her customers with internet service, and thanks to the good service, she has been able to gain many good customers.

He is a father and a welder by profession.  Joe began purchasing tools for personal use, but later on his family suggested that he solicit jobs from private residences.  This led to the business he owns today, along with a list of existing customers.  Joe works every day at his shop, but he travels to different sites as needed.  The major challenge he faces is dealing with the risk of getting robbed whenever he visits the homes of people who request his services.  It should be noted that his tools are quite expensive.  \r\n<p>\r\nJoe is married.  His wife does not have an outside job, so she is devoted to being a full-time homemaker.  They have four children (ages 13, 8, 6, and 2), most of whom attend a state school.  Joe will use his loan to buy a welding machine and a drill.  Within the next few years, he would like to equip his workshop with upgraded machines so that he can improve his financial standing.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1094679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a welding machine and a drill.

El pr\u00e9stamo que Dulce solicita lo necesita para invertirlo en la compra de refrescos, dulces, alborotos, pan, agua, entre otros. Con la ayuda de este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 surtir bien su negocio, podr\u00e1 vender m\u00e1s y de esta forma obtener mayores ganancias que le ayuden a los gastos educativos, de alimentaci\u00f3n y de salud de sus hijos. Dulce tiene mas de tres a\u00f1os de solicitar prestamos en FAMA y ha sido una cliente muy puntual con sus cuotas.","en":"Dulce, age 28, is a member of the \u201cMarzo\u201d (March) communal bank.

She is a 45-year-old married mother of four, and she and her family reside in La Soledad neighborhood in Juticalpa, Honduras. Digna makes a living selling groceries and learned this business when she was single since her mother had a convenience store and Digna helped her tend to it. When she got married her husband gave her money to set up her own store and since that time she has managed her own business. Her work day begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 9 p.m., and he eldest son helps her tend to customers. Her biggest disadvantage is that there are numerous convenience stores in her neighborhood, but she always treats her customers very well so they come back. Digna is requesting this loan to purchase general groceries like rice, beans, oil, lard, condiments, refreshments, meats, dairy products, sausages, bread, coffee, churros, vegetables, and other products. With the support of this loan Digna will be able to stock her store with more and varied products and her customers will find what they need, helping her earn more profits.

Ram\u00f3n makes a living as much in farming as he does in soldering, since he has a workshop where he works with metal, making doors, windows and other items. He also dedicates himself to his crops and it's for this reason he is requesting the loan since he had planted rice, corn and vegetables, which he lost during the hard winter, and now he hopes with this loan to replant and recuperate what he lost. He just started with the community bank, but his wife has been with it from the start, but since she has become ill he now is requesting a loan, which was always used for his work. His dreams are for his wife to get better and for his harvest to go very well to recover what he lost."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1097789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer and pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Rocafuerte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T02:10:06Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ram\u00f3n Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":360,"local_amount":360,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209226},{"amount":240,"local_amount":240,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335544},{"amount":240,"local_amount":240,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391323},{"amount":360,"local_amount":360,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150222}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T02:08:54Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":427300,"name":"Mujeres Trabajadoras De Laderas De Chillon Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Jes\u00fas tiene 49 a\u00f1os.

Marcelino has good personal and commercial references.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":787554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm animals and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T02:40:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":104.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":109},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":117.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":121.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":126.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":134.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":138.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":144.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":147.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":432841,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is a resident of Murang\u2019a in Central Kenya where she lives with her family of  four children - two of whom are adults and the other two are juniors who are still in school.

He is single and works hard to sustain himself and continually provide income for his everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJoemar operates a food stall where he sells fish balls. In the Philippines, fish balls are commonly sold at street stalls; they are served skewered and can be dipped in different kinds of sauces. Fish balls are somewhat flat in shape and often made with the meat of a cuttlefish. His other products include squid balls and quail eggs. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 200 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue his business operations, he is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. He will use the loan to buy more fish ball products and other ingredients needed in his business. He expects a boost to his income as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nJoemar hopes to be able to expand his business soon.

Her business is located at her house; at the beginning, it consisted only in selling gallons of water and gas. She was very welcome in her neighbourhood because no one else sold these. Thanks to this, her business grew very swiflty, enabling her to gather the necessary capital to open an internet caf\u00e9. She attends customers together with her daughter, who studies computer science. The caf\u00e9 stays open Monday to Sunday, from morning until night, in order to have customers. Martha tells us that her neighbourhood is quiet and thus she has not had serious trouble with criminal activity. She is married to Hermenegildo, who is an automobile mechanic.

Annalisa is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnnalisa operates a variety store, which is a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Annalisa earns money by buying wholesale and selling by the piece. Her store is next to her house. Her customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 pesos in sales daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products for resale.

She sells at home and in the afternoons and evenings she travels about. Her grandchildren help her with the business. We note that she has had her dining room business for more than thirty years, since her husband died and she took over the sole care of the family and thanks to God she has always done well. Later she began selling other products. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy clothes, shoes, perfumes, and provisions for the preparation of her dishes.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to get ahead in her business and give her grandchildren a good education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1098731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, shoes, perfumes, and provisions ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Bahia de Caraquez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":210,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":210,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209227},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335545},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391324},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150223},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383362}],"funded_date":"2012-06-11T20:31:29Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":427958,"name":"Mar\u00eda Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la hermosa ciudad de Bah\u00eda De Caraquez, conocida por sus hermosas playas, por su rica y variada gastronom\u00eda y por la calidez de su gente, cada quine d\u00edas se re\u00fanen las socias del Banco Comunal Sociedad De Bah\u00eda.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora  Mar\u00eda, tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de  un hijo el cual ya es mayor de edad e independiente.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngeli operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Angeli earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. \r\n\r\nAside from the variety store, she has a bake shop where different types of pastries and bread are sold. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,270 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her bakeshop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngeli hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and lot. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Hope earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nHope hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to give her children a quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She has been making a living doing this for four years and thanks to this she has been able to get ahead without having to ask her children nor anyone else for help, she says.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of household items like perfume, lotion, and cosmetics, among other things.\r\n\r\nHer dream is a have a large store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1098757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household items like perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Bahia de Caraquez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T14:00:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209236},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335554},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391333},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150232},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383371}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T12:38:34Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":427967,"name":"El Mar Y Sol  (Portoviejo) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela San Gregorio  de la ciudad de Portoviejo se re\u00fanen  cada quince d\u00edas las 15 socias y los 2 socios del Banco Comunal El Mar y Sol.

This place is known for being very dynamic where most of its residents work in farming and animal husbandry; it is a zone with much vegetation.\r\n\r\nWe met Bernardina, 42, in this place.  She\u2019s married and has four children who are 18, 13, 9 and 2 years old; two of them attend secondary school and one is in elementary school.  Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nShe learned dressmaking at a local academy and now in order to earn her own income and taking advantage of her dressmaking skills she set up a small workshop at home where she makes all type of clothes, sheets, pillows and whatever else her customers request.  She works on order from individuals and seasonally also makes uniforms for local institutions, schools and high-schools.  She works every day from 6am until 10pm and sometimes even later when she has pending orders to deliver.

She made the most of every order and sold all of her products.  Now her demand has increased, and she doesn't want to let her customers down or lose the opportunity to do business.  This is why she wants to make a new investment, but she needs the capital.  This is why she is requesting a loan from Integral that will let her buy cosmetics, perfumes, creams, etc.  Celina del Carmen knows that she is very responsible and has very good references.  She is sure that she will make her payments on time.  At the same time, she promises her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1099609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, perfumes, and creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celina Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":428367,"name":"Pedro Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nPedro Eduardo tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, y habita junto a su familia. \u00c9l se dedica a la agricultura desde hace mucho tiempo.

She is a good, likable and hard-working woman. Her partner is Tob\u00edas, with whom she has three children. She provided them with education until they left home and left her side, and they are now independent. Now she lives only with her partner in their own house, and she works hard to have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nHer work is renting video games in a shop she set up in her house. She has every type of game, from the most traditional to the latest games. She is always thinking about renovating her business, since her customers demand the latest games. She has help from her partner, who on some occasions takes care of the business in his free moments, since he works for a private company. Sonia has 6 years with this business and she feels very comfortable running it. \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 18 for her with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support to continue. She is sure that she will continue to be responsible, as with the loans she obtained previously.

With the loan that she will receive in her communal bank, she will also help her husband with his business.  He sells all types of clothing.  He sells on credit and collects every 8 years.  In this way, the two of them have managed to get ahead with their family.  She tells us that she has had her eatery for 13 years and it has always done very well; her customers prefer her food because of the special seasonings she puts into her dishes that make them special.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy rice, meat, fish and other groceries to prepare her dishes, and she will also buy clothing for her husband's business.

She maintains her financial situation by selling beauty products.  Carla started approximately three years ago after a neighbor invited her to a meeting where she learned about the advantages and potential income from this business.  She works alone when she has free time away from her job as a housekeeper.  Her greatest challenge is dealing with the winter season because her house is located along streets that are not paved, which are difficult to access and prevent her from making visits.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarla is a single mother with two children, Wendy (age 11) who is in middle school and Lenin (age 4) who is in elementary school.  She says that it is difficult being a mother even though the father of her children, who lives in Guayaquil, provides support and sends her money.  This loan will be used to buy cr\u00e8mes, perfumes, and makeup.
