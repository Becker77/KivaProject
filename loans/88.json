The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Now, two of her children work in Manila and two have their own families.\r\n\r\nFor her youngest child, Bernardita wants to ensure her future by supporting her studies until she graduates from college. She believes that the only way she could make this dream of hers come true is through strengthening her small business and making it grow to increase the profits she makes from it. She therefore is requesting a loan through ASHI to be able to support her dream for her family through her farming business managed by her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":415049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

While not the only means for generating revenue, she has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clemencia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clemencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide services. Clemencia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand her business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Clemencia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is starting a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Vaifafo needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in renovating the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vaifafo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaifafo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaifafo F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She sells women and men shoes that she buys in Ereen, China, a border town, where many inexpensive Chinese products are imported to Mongolia. Because Baigalmaa chooses the cheapest shoes, her shoes are sold fast and easily. She is requesting a loan to increase her working capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":550941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2010-06-07T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baigalmaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98433.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111441.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118845.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123005.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125970.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131719.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":133212.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141875.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147393.79},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150570.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156015.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161516.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.24},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.29,"local_amount":98433.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100081.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159614219},{"amount":81.84,"local_amount":111441.51,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":113307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166828945},{"amount":87.27,"local_amount":118845.62,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":120835.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172095407},{"amount":90.34,"local_amount":123005.22,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":125064.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177388000},{"amount":92.51,"local_amount":125970.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":128079.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182526145},{"amount":96.73,"local_amount":131719.38,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":133924.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660857},{"amount":97.83,"local_amount":133212.51,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":135442.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191404146},{"amount":104.19,"local_amount":141875.59,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":144250.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195822416},{"amount":108.24,"local_amount":147393.79,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":149861.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264810},{"amount":343.76,"local_amount":468102.3,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":475939.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206131730}],"funded_date":"2010-06-30T17:43:55Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":210143,"name":"Kisagazi Farmers, Mubende Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"32-year-old Agiri B. has, for the last ten years, been plying her retail shop business in Kisaagazi, Mubende.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying groceries, toiletries, and beverages for her variety store. She will also use some of the loan to purchase more raw materials needed for her rag-making business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can leave a successful business as a legacy to her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She resides with her husband in a large, traditional extended families in Kabo\u00efla II, the downtown of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having had the chance to advance in school due to societal reasons, she soon started working in small-scale commerce about thirteen years ago. She buys and sells Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, shoes, beauty products, etc. She is in high demand, especially by her customer base (essentially of women), for the quality of her products. She receives many orders from surrounding towns. Business is booming, and her customers are very satisfied. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about three years ago. She is now on her second individual loan. The previous one was properly repaid. She intends to spend her second loan on: 15 lengths of Wax <i>pagne<\/i> cloth, 15 outfits of embroidered fabrics, 20 pairs of plastic footwear, etc. She gets her supplies in Bobo Dioulasso (in the Republic of Burkina Faso) and will sell them door-to-door in Sikasso and often in towns surrounding Sikasso. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions making a monthly profit of 170,000 francs CFA that will essentially be used to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the interest on the loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":783466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-06-02T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38888.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581197},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750966},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120273},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882105},{"amount":86.12,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699196},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655461},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874265},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.89,"processed_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283059},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":38888.88,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-24T08:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":39175.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424483}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T02:34:27Z","paid_date":"2012-03-24T08:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":308491,"name":"Felibert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felibert is 32 years-old and lives in the Philippines.

Her job allows her to earn money to support her family; she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she most likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she enjoys the training program. \r\n\r\nIn the photograph a friend of one of the members can also be seen."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":813354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy radios","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-18T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candelaria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lady  Giovana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estefa Albertina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19191.9,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1599.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1598.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.26},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.26},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":462.53,"local_amount":3198.86,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3219.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115869},{"amount":462.53,"local_amount":3198.86,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3219.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877524},{"amount":462.53,"local_amount":3198.86,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3219.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694231},{"amount":693.8,"local_amount":4798.29,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650265},{"amount":462.53,"local_amount":3198.86,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3219.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867262},{"amount":231.08,"local_amount":1598.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277028}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T18:09:43Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":320786,"name":"Amos Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lisnah and her husband have been running a fried bread business for four years.

She has been fighting for years to support her two small children and give them all the support she can for their educations. <p>It's extremely important to point out that during the past 3 years, Eva has received 64 loans from Ceprodel, and has known how to very wisely take advantage of investment in her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

For this reason, she's asking for a loan to buy the following materials: 80 yards of Sincatex fabric which can be bought at $3 per yard, 80 yards of stretch raincoat fabric which can be bought at $1.50 per yard, 50 yards of Dacron Tico fabric which can be bought at $1.40 per yard and 50 yards of fabric in a variety of colors which can be bought at $1.40 per yard. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julie Lutz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy 80 yards of Sincatex fabric, 80 yards de stretch fabric, 50 yards of Dacron Tico fabric and 50 yards of fabric in a variety of colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bluefields","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 -83.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":76,"posted_date":"2009-02-02T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.97},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27036472},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":62.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35926949},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382181},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110348}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T02:22:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:24:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Lutz","image":270837}},{"id":90497,"name":"Rakhila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakhila B. is a 53-year-old teacher who breeds calves for meat production in the small village of Imishli City.

She and her family live in Macabi, Paijan, in the province of Ascope, which is part of the La Libertad region. She lives about three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nAbout six months ago, Charito opened a canteen in her home. She sells staples like rice, sugar and oil, as well as snacks and drinks. She started her business in her mother's home, near a school.

She is a resident of Kadamjai, a small town in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan. Just like most of the  residents, Kanygul raises cattle. For many years, Kanygul raised cattle just for family purposes but her husband advised her to try starting a business in this sphere. Now, she has two heads of cattle and runs a slow business. Her husband is a cab driver, her oldest son is in Russia to earn a good income, her second son is in the army, her daughters live separately and her youngest son helps to take care of the cattle. Twenty years ago, the business was started from only 2,000 soms and since then, the family has managed to make major repairs to the house and arrange wedding ceremonies for their daughters. Now, Kanygul would like to start a dairy business and she has applied for this loan in order to do so. She hopes to get a loan and to use the proceeds to purchase a car for her son so that he can work as a cab driver. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

He started his business by opening a small shop with a simple amount of capital. As his business is small and a far distance from town, he uses that to help old families so they don't have to go to the market in the city and attempts as much as possible to provide his customers needs himself.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Dilshod sells hay for animals at his house and at the market. He buys the hay wholesale from local farmers. Having been working on this business for 9 years already, he has become a well-known seller of hay in his village and has many customers who buy hay only from him. The price he charges for hay is based on the quantity that his customer buys.<P>\r\n\r\nDilshod also offers a discount to his regular buyers, to those customers who come to him often. With a loan from IMON International, Dilshod plans to increase his stock in order to fully meet the demand of his growing customer base.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Aleta has successfully repaid a previous loan, to purchase general farm supplies and equipment, of 750 WST from SPBD.  Aleta is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fifth loan from SPBD.  Aleta plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

years. A married father of four school-aged children who all attend school, he produces on his mixed farm milk, maize and beans, all of which are sold locally. He is also a casual worker at Kenya Seed Company in Kitale town. <p>\r\n\r\nJoseph is requesting this loan of 65,000KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a motorcycle. He says that the income obtained from this added source of income will make life more comfortable because he will be able to afford the basic needs of his family and some small luxury. He hopes to purchase another motorcycle in the future to enable him to take a contract for transporting the milk of those farmers in the interior region of Kitale. <p>\r\n\r\nJoseph says that his biggest challenge arises during the rainy season when the roads are sometimes very poor, causing him to lose business.

She is married and has two children, aged 14 and 12.  In 2004, she established  her cow-raising business.  Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family. \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and will use her most recent to buy a young, milk-giving cow. In the future, Parbati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our <a

He lives together with Flora, his wife of 10 years.  The couple have 5 children and live with two of them in their own home which is located in the small village of Aymara.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Alejandro gets up to take care of his day's work as he is a man with multiple occupations.  During the mornings, he goes out to work as a builder.  His work in this field depends on the contracts that he negotiates.  He tells us that he earns 60 soles a day on his best days.  However, as this is not a stable job, he also spends time farming.  This is a business that he learned when he was a boy.  His main crops are tubers such as potatoes, olluca, maca and mashua (native tubers).  At harvest time he sells his produce in the wholesale market in the city of Huancayo.  He has been doing this for more than 20 years.  In addition, his wife helps him to take care of their cows, sheep and horses which they fatten up and then sell at a higher price.  \r\n\r\nAlejandro would now like to improve his income as he would like to provide his children with a good education.  He belongs to the 'Los Pinos' community bank and this is his first loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive your cooperation so that he can realize his plans.

She is married and the mother of two children.  In 1990, she started selling \u201cpagnes\u201d (colorful West African cloth) and sheets in the districts of Lom\u00e9.  She used to be a door-to-door retail seller.  She now distributes pagnes and sheets on credit from district to district and collects the money after a week.

His wife is an agricultural engineer and works in MAGFOR.  For the past four years, Mr. C. has worked in the local municipality as Project Director.  He is requesting his first loan in order to improve his home, installing a ceramic floor since it is currently quite slippery; he would also like to put up blinds and glass in the windows as they currently only have bars covering them.  His dream is to improve his home since his children are growing, both physically and intellectually.  One will graduate soon in engineering, another is in his second year of college and the third is in his 3rd year of high school.  Mr. C. would like his children to feel fulfilled in their home and see it in good condition with comfortable accommodations.  He owns his home but for many years has not been able to find funds to improve it until he found out that the mayor's office has an agreement with AFODENIC which offers much better terms than banks who offer loans that debtors can never pay and they are eventually left with nothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

Both are high school students and are sincere about studying. Salvador, Lorna's husband is a delivery helper for gas tanks, while Lorna is an entrepreneur. She is as hard working as her husband because she is determined to give her two children the opportunity of going to college - an opportunity which she and her husband never had when they were young because of poverty.\r\n\r\nLorna had different kinds of businesses when she had an access to credit for business capital through ASHI in 1997. However, none of those became successful until 2004. Lorna never thought of fish to buy and sell as a business, although the village where she and her family lives is surrounded by the sea and fish ponds. It was after several failures that she tried the said business. In 2004, Lorna's loan from ASHI was Php20,000. She used the loan to finance her first endeavor with fish to buy and sell. After years of doing such business activity, she found success and contentment. She has been a vendor of fish since then until now. With her previous loan she planned to buy crab, shrimp and other varieties of fish for her avid costumers to have many choices in buying. Lorna rents a space in the market where she sells her fish. \r\n\r\nDespite her busy schedule in attending to her business, Lorna gives time to attend to her weekly center meeting in ASHI and pays her weekly amortization from the loan she has taken out. Through ASHI, Lorna was able to realize the importance of savings thus making her save weekly in preparation for her other personal needs.

He travels to Le\u00f3n and works in the mayor's office as a general accountant.  He lives with his parents.  Previously, he worked at a business in accounts receivable part time.  He has worked very hard at school, and he is in his last year of his accounting program.  He also has started to construct his own home on his parents' land, but he hasn't finished it yet because there are still many details to be completed.

Adem\u00e1s, ya tiene pensado, para m\u00e1s adelante, sembrar en mayor cantidad diversidad de frutas, ya que es un negocio muy rentable.\n\nEste es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y se muestra muy agradecido con todas las personas que hicieron posible el cr\u00e9dito que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando, tambi\u00e9n dice que est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con el desempe\u00f1o de su banco comunal, ya que todos los integrantes son muy responsables en el pago de sus cuotas.\n\nCristian tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de un terreno peque\u00f1o para seguir sembrando en mayor cantidad y as\u00ed aumentar sus ventas.","en":"Cristian, 30, lives in his own home in the central Peruvian jungle with his wife, Elizabeth, 24, and their two children.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working man has been a farmer since he was very young; he grows citrus fruits and bananas on his own farmlands.  He confesses that he must be very careful with this type of work in order to insure a good crop and, despite several failures in his life, he must never stop working in order to get ahead.\r\n\r\nEvery day he rises very early to watch over his crops.  He usually works alone but, when production increases for any reason, he hires hands to help him plant or harvest.\r\n\r\nHis harvested crops are sold to area wholesalers who pay the usual prices for each sack of fruit.  In addition, his plans for the future are to plant a greater variety of fruit because this is quite a profitable business.\r\n\r\nThis is his 4th loan with MFP and he is very grateful to all the people that made the loan possible so that he can continue working.  He also states that he is very satisfied with the work his communal bank does because all the members are responsible with their payments.\r\n\r\nCristian is going to use the funds to buy a small lot to add to his farmlands so that he can plant a larger quantity thereby increasing his sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":525728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886329}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T22:28:54Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":197902,"name":"Thorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thorn P., 44 years old, is a villager who lives in Pun Phnum village in Takeo province.

Nimfa has been engaged in her business for 19 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nimfa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Nimfa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nimfa is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Nimfa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n       \r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n       \r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":542957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy products to sell and for the tuition fees of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sindangan-Siayan, Zamboanga del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2010-06-07T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151943517},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159682554},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166896694},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172164473},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177460106}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T15:18:48Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":210191,"name":"Bernadette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernadette is 48 years old.

Four of the children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nShe successfully repaid her previous loan of 45,000KES from Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan of 70,000KES to purchase a dairy cow.

There are many occupations that was traditionally male dominated are now done by women.  Ni Luh Sutami is an example.  She has been farming cattle for the past 2 years.  Her earnings even surpassed her husband's who works as a farmer.   So her farm really helps her family's finances tremendously.  Each cow can only have a child each year.  Each infant cow that is ready for maturing can be sold for $220 to $330, depending on the gender.  In general male cows sell more than the female.  In the past year, Ni Luh Sutami earned $280 from one infant cow.  This earnings is not enough to help her husband to pay for all her family's needs., especially this year her son, Gede Artayasa is starting school.\r\n\r\nWith a loan from Dinari, Ni Luh Sutami expects to buy one more breeder cow.  She really hopes that she can produce more cows to be sold so she earns more than last year.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSelain sebagai ibu  rumah tangga, ibu-ibu di Bali juga sangat perperan aktif bekerja atau berusaha untuk menunjang usaha \/ pendapatan suami. Banyak pekerjaan atau usaha yang dulunya dilakukan oleh kaum pria kini sudah dikerjakan oleh para wanita. Seperti apa yang telah dilakukan oleh Ni Luh Sutami. Memelihara ternak sapi yang telah ditekuni sejak 2 tahun belakangan ini telah banyak membantu perekonomian keluarganya bahkan hasil yang didapatpun tak kalah dengan pendapatan suaminya yang bekerja  sebagai petani. Seekor Induk sapi dalam satu tahun hanya beranak satu kali.Dan harga seekor anak sapi yang sudah siap untuk di pasarkan untuk bibit berkisar 2 sampai 3 juta rupiah tergantung dari jenis kelaminnya. Pada umumnya sapi jantan harganya lebih mahal di bandingkan yang betina. Dalam tahun terhakhir ini  Ni luh Sutami mendapat hasil Rp 2.500.000 dari penjualan 1 ekor anak sapi. Hasil ini dirasa belum cukup untuk bisa membantu penghasilan suaminya yang hanya sebagai petani kecil. ( penggarap tanah orang lain) Apalagi tahun ini  Gede Artayasa anaknya harus masuk sekolah sehingga Ni Luh Sutami memerlukan biaya tambahan .      \r\nDengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari , Niluh Sutami  membeli satu ekor Induk sapi lagi bahkan saat ini kedua induk sapi peliharaan Ni luh Sutami sedang hamil. Besar harapan Niluh Sutami sapi-sapi peliharaanya bisa melahirkan dengan selamat, sehingga tahun ini dia bisa mendapatkan hasil dari jerih payahnya lebih banyak dari tahun yang lalu

She lives with them in a house which she was able to construct, at much sacrifice, while forced into the role of mother and father in her home.\r\n<p>\r\nFor ten years now she has worked for various entities, public and private, where she acquired experience and improved her performance.  For the last several months, she has been processing gas at an enterprise where she works every day, from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon.  But what Concepcion wants is to have her own business, and for that, her goal is to prepare her house to contain a store, which will bear her name.  This is why she works with much joy, performing her best as an employee, and with this goal she will continue to work many hours in this enterprise.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has had 13 loans with PRISMA Microfinance, and these have permitted her to improve her condition of life, just like her companions in the community bank, which is now seven years old.

Weak people get afraid to lose their positions and begin to feel themselves psychologically backward or weaker than others. However, among ordinary people we can still find many examples of strong-willed people, who not only do not get afraid, but go into business with full enthusiasm and energy, and quickly grow in prosperity. Daily obstacles and life ordeals cannot prevent these people from achieving their goals as they are mature minded and know that after the darkness of night comes the light of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeishebubu M. is the leader of this group. She is fifty eight and has two children. Her husband used to be a farmer. Beishebubu\u2019s two sons are grown ups. The elder son is thirty five and the younger is thirty. Both of her sons make their own living independently. Beishebubu obtains her sons\u2019 support. However, she prefers to stay independent and, using the skills she acquired from her husband, she decided to be a farmer.

Adriana is 23, did 3 years of high school, is a single mother and has one little angel named Carla Selene, age 5, who is just about to start preschool. Adriana currently lives with her parents, and bit by bit the way is becoming smooth for her. She started her business selling meat jerky, sausage and beef enchiladas. She tells me that she would like to get ahead professionally, learn and start a career in information technology in order to offer her daughter and herself a better life...how? Through obtaining a better job and more income. With this opportunity she will achieve what she most desires: owning her own home. She tells me that her group is very united and that they are doing their best in their activities so that they do not lose the benefits of continued support that Fundacion Realidad and Kiva have offered them.

She and her partner live in a house that they own with their three children who she works hard to provide for.\r\n\r\nThe green countryside around Huaran, where Martha lives now, is in the Valle Sagrado de los Incas.  The area is an important place for Martha and a happy one, too, because she's been able to do the work that she enjoys there.  She grew up on a farm and learned farming from her parents.  Now she has her own farm where she and her partner work together growing crops such as potatoes, maize and various vegetables.  She also raises and sells small animals: guineau pigs, turkeys, pigs and chickens.  Martha is applying for a loan to expand her animal sales business.
