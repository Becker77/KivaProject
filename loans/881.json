She has been separated from her husband, but by the grace of God, she was able to send three of her children through college (they are now working), and currently two children are in high school. She, together with her older children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a meat stall. She buys meat from suppliers that deliver the meat to respective markets and vendors. Her products are pork, beef, and other meat products. There are many patrons who prefer her products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies of pork and beef needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to have a happy home. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1110018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional meat supplies and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4346.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359418},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3621.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303233},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1449.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355957},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1448.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114071}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T17:39:23Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":433486,"name":"Junibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Junibeth is 30 years old and single.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighbourhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Luzviminda earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them bit by bit for a profit. Her store is adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda dreams of being able to financially support her child through college. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de ladrillos. Inicio su negocio con un capital peque\u00f1o aprendiendo la actividad de un cu\u00f1ado. Jos\u00e9 nos comenta que en la elaboraci\u00f3n se llevan a cabo una serie de procesos est\u00e1ndar que comprenden desde la elecci\u00f3n del material arcilloso, al proceso de empacado final. La materia prima utilizada para la producci\u00f3n de ladrillos es la arcilla. Debido a la caracter\u00edstica de absorber la humedad, la arcilla, cuando est\u00e1 hidratada, adquiere la plasticidad suficiente para ser moldeada, muy distinta de cuando est\u00e1 seca, que presenta un aspecto terroso. Lego de esto viene la fase de endurecimiento, por secado, o por cocci\u00f3n, el material arcilloso adquiere caracter\u00edsticas de notable solidez con una disminuci\u00f3n de masa, por p\u00e9rdida de agua. En resumen el proceso es el siguiente. Maduraci\u00f3n, dep\u00f3sito de materia prima procesada, humidificaci\u00f3n, moldeado, secado, cocci\u00f3n, almacenaje. La exposici\u00f3n al aire, lluvia, sol, hielo favorece a la descomposici\u00f3n de la materia org\u00e1nica que pueda estar presente. Este trabajo requiere de mucha fuerza f\u00edsica por ese motivo Jos\u00e9 tiene problemas de hernia y de columna. A eso tambien se le suma que sufre problemas de presion ya que al momento de la cocion necesita manipular el horno el cual tiene que estar en una temperatura alta y adecuada para el preceso, como podemos ver en la imagen. Su esposa es ama de casa y tiene 6 hijos quienes asisten a la escuela fiscal. Con el pr\u00e9stamo comprar materia prima para aumentar su producci\u00f3n para poder terminar su vivienda.","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 59 years old and lives in Quevedo. He makes and sells bricks, and started his business with a small capital investment and learned the trade from his brother-in-law. \r\n\r\nManufacturing the bricks involves a series of standard processes ranging from the choice of material to the final packaging process. The raw material for production of bricks is clay. Because of clay's ability to absorb moisture, when hydrated it gains sufficient plasticity to be shaped, which is very different from when it is dry and gains an earthy appearance. After this comes the stage of hardening, drying, or cooking, where the clay gains a remarkable strength with reduced mass due to water loss. In summary, the process is as follows: maturation, storage of the processed raw material, humidification, molding, drying, cooking, storage. Exposure to air, rain, sun, and ice accelerates the decomposition of organic matter. \r\n\r\nThis work requires a lot of physical strength, which is why Jos\u00e9 has a hernia and problems with his spine.  Jos\u00e9's wife is a housewife and has 6 children who attend public school.

He tells us that like all businesses, the competition does not help because sales go down.  Nevertheless, it helps the customers because they are able to choose.\r\n\r\nWimper tells us that this also makes the service improve, and there are specials to get customer attention.  He indicates that his secret is the time that he spends at the store.  He opens at 5 in the morning and closes at 11 at night.\r\n\r\nHe does this because he realized that a lot of parents buy lunch that the children take to school every day.  Clearly, by closing so late he is subject to delinquency.  Because he works alone he is prone to this delinquency.\r\n\r\nWimper is separated, his children are independent, but they do live with him.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy products to increase his stock.

Her house is made of insubstantial building materials.\r\n\r\nIn a small room in her dwelling, Violeta has set up a small store where she sells her neighbors and customers a variety of groceries, carbonated beverages and basic staple items.  Her store is one of the few that exists in the zone so it\u2019s of great help for her neighbors.  With income from this activity she helps her husband support the home.  Her husband works as a driver for a transportation firm that connects her settlement with the city of Chiclayo.  Her family exhibits quite a bit of willingness to work and to cooperate with her neighbors.\r\n\r\nVioleta is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a 1500 new sol loan that she will use to buy groceries and clothes taking advantage of the approaching feast days.  Thanks to this investment she hopes to improve income and give her family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1106648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries and clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lagunas - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T18:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T18:10:15Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":141.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":433519,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a clothing sales business in the Philippines.

Visitors, too, come from far and wide to admire the unparalleled spectacle of millions of monarch butterflies together in one place.  Gerardo and his wife, Carmina, have 2 children, both in high school.  He tells us that he has operated a bakery business, making a traditional bread, for 3 years.  He is happy with the business and says that his customers like his bread and always come back for more.  He says that he started the business after he was laid off from the company where he worked before and needed a way to support his family and pay for his children's schooling.  His mother suggested that he start a bakery and agreed to show him how to make the traditional bread that is now the mainstay of the business.  Gerardo is applying for a loan that he will use to buy supplies--flour, eggs, milk, butter, yeast, firewood, etc.--for making bread.  He sells what he makes on the streets of the city and people come out of their houses to buy from him.  He is grateful for the loan because it will allow him to buy the supplies that he needs.  He says that his goal for the future is to buy a larger oven because the one he has is too small.  The other members of the group--Teresa, Juana, Imelda, Rosa, Elizabether and Adela--will invest their share of the loan in their businesses which vary from clothing sales to grocery sales."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1104153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock their retail businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":433531,"name":"Arin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arin, 43 years old, is married and has three children.

When we met her she received us with a big smile and finished the interview still smiling.  Her personality exhibits much vitality and energy needed for her day to day.  She lives in Quevedo and sells general merchandise.  \r\n\r\nShe started the business because it\u2019s very commercial and easy to sell because of its cost and because it\u2019s eye-catching.  Her products range from underwear, ribbons, hair bands, Foamy decorative items, rag dolls, etc.  Ana goes from place to place in the city carrying her items in a suitcase accompanied by her niece who attends high school but needs money which is why she accompanies her every day from 8am. \r\n\r\nShe likes what she does because it\u2019s helped her get ahead and gradually reach her goals.  Ana tells us that her greatest concern is thieves because since they are women and they are carrying money they are vulnerable to being robbed.\r\n\r\nWith respect to her personal life, she comments that she was married but her husband abandoned her with her children.  They are currently adults who are 37, 32 and 27 years of age, all married; they visit her from time to time.  She loves her family very much because they gave her the strength to carry on.

His children are adults and only one still lives with them; he attends public school.\r\n\r\nHe started out opening a small store in his neighborhood because there weren\u2019t any at that time.  He opened it six years ago and he\u2019s done very well, so much so that he\u2019s now been able to enlarge it.  He works alongside his wife who says she keeps him company so that he won\u2019t get bored.  His work day isn\u2019t too demanding since they are open from 8 in the morning to 7 at night every day.\r\n\r\nCarlos comments that the best part is being able to control his own time so in days when he\u2019s tired he doesn\u2019t open and this is no problem.  A short while ago they also started selling food at night and it\u2019s having good results.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy merchandise for the store.  Carlos tells us that his goal is to open a bicycle repair shop and two other businesses.

\n\n","en":"The group \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d  is made up of 8 hardworking and responsible women who work in the fields.  They say that they chose this name (The Swallows) because these small birds are found in the community and ejido (communal farming lands) where they live.  Maria del Socorro (who is affectionately called Mari) is the representative of this group.  She tells us that she is 37 years old and has been married to Benjamin for 13 years.  They have formed a family with 3 children, 2 of whom attend school. \r\n\r\nMari has had a business raising sheep for 2 years.  She started this business because of an idea given to her by her sister-in-law.  She currently has 2 sheep that she cares for very well.  Every morning she gets up and gives them hay, pasture grass or ground corn.  When she sees that they are very dirty she washes them, and she also provides them with water when needed.  \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to buy more sheep.  She would like to buy two, and the food to feed them.  What Mari enjoys the most about this work is when her sheep have babies, because she has a sheep that just had a baby and Mari received it with a lot of excitement and pleasure.  Meanwhile, Mari told us about her experience with the baby sheep in a joking manner, saying, \"What I like the least is when they cry a lot and I don't know why.  Perhaps it's because they are very spoiled and so they know that I will give them anything they ask for.\"  She also tells us that it she finds it difficult when her sheep get sick and die, and almost all of the group members agree.  Also, another difficulty that Mari faces is that the place where she has her sheep is a very small space.  Mari's goal is to have her children finish a course of study, even a short one, so that they can have a secure job, because she wants her family's quality of life to improve.  \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are: Elena, who will invest in pigs and chickens, Lura, who will buy pasture grass for sheep, Carmen, who will buy pigs, Candelaria, who will buy chickens and pigs, Maribel, who will buy chickens, Victorina, who will buy pigs and turkeys, and finally, Cristina, who will buy sheep.  The members of the group \"Las Golondrinas del Ejido,\" are sincerely grateful for this loan that is being granted to them by FRAC and by Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1105777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and pasture grass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pedro El Alto, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":681.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9524.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419075},{"amount":681.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9524.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568651},{"amount":1021.88,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":14287.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399941},{"amount":340.62,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4762.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407608}],"funded_date":"2012-06-12T21:45:23Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":432151,"name":"Martha Asunci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora se re\u00fane en La parroquia Sequita que pertenece a Montecristi prospero cant\u00f3n manabita, lleno de gente trabajadora, dedicada y orgullosa de sus ra\u00edces, La Sequita es una parroquia donde sus habitantes son gente honesta que solo saben trabajar y dedicarse a sus familias.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Martha, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene cinco hijos de 14, 9, 7, 4  y 1 a\u00f1o, la mayor estudia en colegio y vive con los abuelos ya que es de otro compromiso que tuvo, los dos siguientes estudian en la escuela.

She told us that in the mornings she prepares some of her products which she sells in the afternoons. She also raises chickens and pigs, because she has room to do so near her house. This also is a small source of income which helps her to get ahead. She has been doing this for the past three years and she is doing very well.   \r\n\r\nOur friend told us that even though the season was not completely good, she was still left with profits, which she used to pay expenses related to the her children's education.

Her son helps her with the business when he's not busy, and in those times when she goes out to sell and to collect.  She sells her products on credit, and collects on a weekly basis.  She has had this store for more than 2 years, and she's been selling Yanbal products for much longer.

She is asking for a loan to purchase more automotive parts and to purchase a curtain for her store. She thanks Vision Fund for helping her fulfill her dreams that would otherwise be cut short. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1087475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase more automotive parts and to purchase a curtain for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santiago Jamiltepec Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T21:50:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2268.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2322.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2479.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2550.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2671.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2832.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2931.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3096.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3217.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3369.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3697.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristin Connor","image":1393863}},{"id":428719,"name":"La Buchicata Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En este grupo se integr\u00f3 una nueva persona es la se\u00f1ora Gladis Alicia quien se dedica a la venta de comida.\nLa representante de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda de la Paz, una se\u00f1ora alegre amable, trabajadora y sobre todo muy  humilde.\nDo\u00f1a Mari como mejor la conocen nos dice que se dedica a la venta de pan, queso, carne enchilada, pollo destazado y huevos de granja desde hace diez a\u00f1os.

From the department of Magdalena, she arrived 10 years ago in the city of Barranquilla with her entire family. They stayed in her parents' house, where she developed a business in order to be able to generate income and sustain her family. This was how, with her husband, she put a restaurant in her father's house, locating it on the terrace. Since it was a main road, it made an impression on the clientele, which gradually increased. Today she sells lunches and a range of fried items and spongy bread rolls or dough products made with corn, cheese, and anise, wrapped in baskets. Her dream for later on is to have her own house and to continue organizing her business. Her great challenge was the displacement from her native land to this city and having to immediately start a business in order to generate income that would cover the basic needs of her family. But this is already in the past, and today she concentrates on her future business growth, although with the need for business capital, in order to develop her work in a harmonious way.

Su naturaleza campesina y capacidad de sembrar la tierra, en esta ciudad, a la que se hab\u00edan trasladado,  le daba pocas posibilidades de  generar ingresos para sustentar los gastos del hogar, pero sus necesidades fueron superiores y emprendieron su propia aventura de negocios, apoyados por un gran amigo, que les prest\u00f3 el primer capital de trabajo, para que compraran mercanc\u00edas variadas y desde entonces han logrado ampliarlo y seguir so\u00f1ando con mejorarlo aun mas su nivel de vida. En la actualidad comercializa sombreros y todos los art\u00edculos de consumo que piden sus clientes; as\u00ed mismo vende pescado de rio y galletas especialmente. Su mercado lo conforman las amas de casa, peque\u00f1as tiendas y recomendados de sus clientes, ubicados en los alrededores del barrio. Su meta es capitalizar su negocio y obtener ingresos para aumentar su bienestar familiar. Su principal desaf\u00edo actualmente es el poco capital de trabajo con el que cuenta,  para poder lograr aumentar su clientela, que cada d\u00eda aumenta la demanda de los productos que vende.

Coming from the countryside her skills were in working the soil which in the city they had relocated to give her few opportunities to generate income to support her home.  But her needs were greater so they started their own business venture with help from a great friend who lent them their initial working capital to buy assorted merchandise.  Since then they managed to expand it and to continue dreaming with improving their standard of living even more.\r\n\r\nShe currently sells hats and all kinds of consumer goods her customers request; she also sells river fish and cookies in particular.   Her market is composed of housewives, small stores and customers referred from other customers located around her neighborhood.  Her goal is to capitalize her business and to obtain income to increase her family\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge at present is the little working capital she has available to increase her clientele which every day increases demand for the products she sells.  This is the reason why she\u2019s calling on her Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy fish to fill her orders and hats and cookies that have

They are all very responsible women who devote all of their efforts towards their families being okay financially.  They chose the name of the group, Valerio, for the place where they live.  It is a large community, which is devoted to growing corn.  The people in this place are sad because there was a recent frost that burned the corn crop.  They believe they will not recover, and it is even worse if it does not rain. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of the group.  She has been in a common-law marriage with Basilio for 15 years.  He works in the field.  Together they have formed a family of five children who are still dependent upon them.  Four of the children go to school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda buys and sells clothes.  During the week she visits her neighbors to offer them a little clothing that she has.  She also takes orders that she will bring from the capital on the week-ends.  She is a very hard-working woman who wants her children\u2019s quality of life to improve.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a loan to buy more wholesale clothes like sweaters, pants, jackets, skirts, and shirts, etc.  This is to cover the pending orders that she has.  The loan will help her stock up on more clothes, and she will have more income.  When the loan comes she will take advantage of it to stock up, and this way she will not need to travel to Mexico City.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda would like to have a car for transportation to other communities in order to sell clothes.  However, she would also love to rent a place to have a stable business and no longer have to walk.  She knows that the rent is very expensive, and she tells us that she has to work a lot more to be able to have a place.\r\n\r\nHer income helps her a lot because she can stock more clothes, she is able to buy clothes, shoes, food, and more than anything, pay the educational expenses.  This is a big help when her husband does not have work.  She helps him with the income from her clothing sales.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and the rest of the group are very grateful for the support from Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC).  They can now invest in their business activities.  Mariel will invest in clothes, Mar\u00eda, in sheep; Concepci\u00f3n in feed for her calves; Celedonia also in calves;  and Concepci\u00f3n in clothes and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThey are all very happy because of the loan, and they are committed to remain in good standing with the institution and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":1103194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio San Jose del Rincon.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":61000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1650,"local_amount":22875,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":22970.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419082},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":15250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15313.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568658},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":15250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":15313.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399948},{"amount":550,"local_amount":7625,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7656.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407615}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T13:09:05Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":433618,"name":"Eter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eter is 59 years old.

He is a person who can talk very comfortably when we comment on his history of success. He was excited knowing we would take the picture. This is why he gave us the interview. In it he tells us that he is 37 years old and lives in a Mazahua community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec. He has been married to Guadalupe for 16 years, and together they have 3 children who attend school. \r\n\r\nIsmael has a shoe store. From the time he was a child, he knew how to sell shoes, since his parents were the founders of the business and of the market where they sell the shoes. Now he has his own business. Although it comes from his parents, Ismael is the one who tends to it and is in charge of it. Ismael is asking for the loan in order to purchase more shoes such as boots, tennis shoes, high heels, sandals, etc., for women, men, girls, and boys. He tells us that the loan will help him a lot since he will be able to invest more in his business and he will not have to worry about buying merchandise for a long time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the difficulty he is facing is that many times he doesn't sell and due to lack of money, and also because he just went through the illness of his wife, he can't invest more in his business. Regarding this, he also says that he likes the countryside a lot and had sheep and a field of cactus, though he sold the sheep to cover the costs resulting from the illness of his wife.\r\n\r\nBut Don Ismael is a very hard-working and responsible person, and he has goals, such as to push hard with his shoe business, since he remembers that once his shoe sales were very good, and he would like to sell like before in order to improve the quality of life for his children and wife. He thinks that due to lack of money he will not be able to raise himself up, but he will do everything possible to raise himself up again. He is a very hard-working family man, for which reason he is very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the support they give him, and he hopes not to end up looking badly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1105850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

In this beautiful area,  Yohenis has her own business selling a variety of goods such as footwear, cosmetics and perfumes.  She decided to start her business when she arrived in this city from Barranquilla (a city two hours from Cartagena) five years ago together with her family (her husband and her two children who are now 6 and 4 years old).  Yohenis started off buying merchandise which she later sold retail.  She sold her products on credit to a small number of customers.  She gradually increased her customer base and also her opportunities for investment.  She started selling products through specialized guides and catalogs and still does this.  Yohenis' main products are cosmetics, clothing, and men's, women's and children's accessories.

El nombre del grupo se eligi\u00f3 ya que cuando las integrantes formaron el grupo, la representante de entonces ten\u00eda un grupo musical de ni\u00f1os llamado \"Rayito de Sol\".\nAhora quien es la representante del grupo es Do\u00f1a Guadalupe de 42 a\u00f1os de edad; ella est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas desde hace 26 a\u00f1os quien tambi\u00e9n es comerciante. Juntos han formado una familia; sus hijos son: Omar quien se encuentra estudiando la universidad y una ni\u00f1a en primaria. Do\u00f1a Lupita, como mejor la conocen, nos cuenta que ella se dedica a vender productos de jarcer\u00eda desde hace 18 a\u00f1os; ella vende en el mercado casi todos los d\u00edas de la semana solo descansa los mi\u00e9rcoles, s\u00e1bados y domingos. Do\u00f1a Lupita inici\u00f3 esta actividad para ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y tambi\u00e9n con los gastos de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar \u00fanicamente vasos de licuadora, pilas, estropajos, fibras y cosas de pl\u00e1sticos. Comenta que el cr\u00e9dito le ayuda de mucho ya que as\u00ed ella puede surtirse en lo que m\u00e1s necesita y as\u00ed no preocuparse un buen rato por su mercanc\u00eda. Sin embargo, Do\u00f1a Lupita tambi\u00e9n explica que presenta dificultades como el no tener un lugar bien establecido para vender ya que por ahora, para vender tranquilamente tiene que buscar y pagar un lugar estable a los delegados del mercado. Por lo general todas las integrantes del grupo tienen esta dificultad y no lo pagan porque es muy caro. En temporadas de lluvia tampoco pueden vender durante mucho tiempo y es la temporada en la que les va un poco mal en sus ventas. Una de las metas que se ha propuesto es que su hijo termine su licenciatura de contadur\u00eda para que su calidad de vida mejore ya que si est\u00e1 dentro de sus posibilidades el ayudarlo, lo har\u00e1, aunque tenga que esforzarse m\u00e1s. Do\u00f1a Lupita menciona que sus ganancias son de gran ayuda ya que cuando no tiene buenas ventas, toma de los ahorros para cubrir otros gastos como la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado y tambi\u00e9n para realizar sus pagos con la institituci\u00f3n.\n\nDo\u00f1a Lupita y las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con Kiva y Vision Fund (FRAC) por el apoyo que les ofrece ya que cada una de ellas podr\u00e1 invertir en sus actividades.

These women live in a community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec where the people in addition to growing corn also work in commerce in a small, very tranquil setting.  The name of the group was chosen when the members formed the group.  The representative back then had a children\u2019s musical group called \u201cRayito de Sol.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe group representative now is Guadalupe, 42.  She\u2019s been married to Jes\u00fas who is also a merchant for 26 years.  They have formed a family together.  Their children are Omar who is attending university and a daughter in elementary school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita, as she\u2019s better known, tells us that she\u2019s been selling janitorial supplies for 18 years.  She sells in the market almost every day of the week; she only takes off Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Do\u00f1a Lupita started this business to help her husband with household expenses and also to help cover her children\u2019s educational costs.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy blender jars, batteries, scouring pads, fibers and plastic items.  She comments that the loan will help her much because she will be able to stock up on what she needs the most and not have to worry about merchandise for a while.  However, Do\u00f1a \r\nLupita also explains that she does have the difficulty caused by not having a well-established place in which to sell because for now, in order to sell in peace, she has to find a space and pay the market delegates for it.  In general, not all the members of the group have this problem and they don\u2019t pay it because it\u2019s very expensive.\r\n\r\nWhen it rains they can\u2019t sell either and sometimes that\u2019s for long periods of time and she does poorly with her sales then.  One of the goals she\u2019s set is that her son finishes his bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting so that his quality of life can improve and if it\u2019s within the realm of her possibility to help him, she\u2019ll do so even if it means striving harder.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita mentions that her profits are of great help to her because when sales are poor she draws from savings to cover other expenses like her children\u2019s schooling, food, shoes and also to make her payments to the institution.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita and the group members are very happy and grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC) for the support they give because each one of them will be able to invest in her activities.  Carolina will invest in remote controls for television sets, DVD\u2019s, etc., Do\u00f1a Elvira will stock her store, Do\u00f1a Eufemia will buy socks, Do\u00f1a Juana will buy robes and aprons, Do\u00f1a Paula and Elena will buy blender jars and janitorial supplies while Josefina will invest in shawls and \u2018rebozos\u2019 [Mexican shawls] and Do\u00f1a Florentina will invest in her grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1105832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy spoons, plates, blender jars, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1246.88,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17358.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419085},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11572.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568661},{"amount":1246.87,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":17358.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399951}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T05:26:10Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":432458,"name":"Mu'ssha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Venancio tiene 70 a\u00f1os de edad y es originario de una poblaci\u00f3n pintoresca y con una gran cultura como la mazahua, \u00e9l es parte del grupo llamado Mu\u00b4ssha dice que eligieron el nombre porque antes invert\u00edan en borregos y es lo que significa esa palabra en lengua mazahua. \u00c9l es carpintero desde hace mas de 20 a\u00f1os, dice que por falta de un trabajo estable un amigo le ense\u00f1o a como trabajar la madera para que tuviera un trabajo m\u00e1s seguro, el platica que hace mesas, sillas, bancos, puertas, ventanas de madera y muchas otras cosas m\u00e1s.

Since 1984 when she arrived in Cartagena, she\u2019s been selling products from the sea to support her home.  Later a merchant gave her the opportunity of selling clothes that he sold and she did very well.  She started earning two incomes and when she had a solid customer base and a little capital she became independent.  Her greatest strength in her business development is her independent spirit because since she was a girl she\u2019d show this to her parents and this is reflected in the joy she gets from commercial activities that she\u2019s engaged in selling many products.\r\n\r\nFour years ago she consolidated into selling fish and she organized her infrastructure with cases that she buys stocked with assorted river fish from the market in the city and then sells among her customers taking advantage of the good prices her suppliers give her which allows her to generate profits to reinvest again like she\u2019s done previously when she added a new business with a stand where she sells candy and natural fruit from each harvest, activities with which she\u2019s effectively complemented her household\u2019s income because her great challenge is attaining her family\u2019s total wellbeing and to see her children become successful at whatever they undertake.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan because she wants to strengthen her three businesses more each time and plans to use this loan to buy fish, candy and fruit at a much more special price than usual because she has the capacity to buy at wholesale with her Kiva loan which will make the investment successful and this is why she\u2019s very competitive when she sells the products and earns more each

He uses a carbon oven in his kitchen and every day sells fried food. He is located in a commercial area of the city where little by little he has gained clients trust and affection. With this business Javier is able to sustain his family and he has high expectations for growing this business since he works hard every day. His wife started this business while he distributed bread to various stores but sales were so low that they decided to divide their efforts. This way his wife could raise their children and he was in charge of the business and helping it grow little by little. Today his main clients are employees from local companies, neighbors, passer-byers making it a highly trafficked place. However he wants to take more opportunities. His investment plan consists of diversifying his merchandise, adding more products requested by clients such as chicken, grilled beef, pork rinds, etc and change his carbon oven to a gas oven. This will improve his working conditions and amplify his product selection according to client\u2019s demand. This is why he is requesting Kiva a loan and start his project. He believes he can succeed due to the highly trafficked area, his strength in his performance, and work discipline.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el  cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor cantidad y de contado v\u00edveres, abarrotes, licores, con los cuales ganar\u00e1 descuentos por el volumen y con ello potencializa el aumento de sus ventas y ganara tambi\u00e9n,  el aumento permanente de los precios que es una constante en su negocio, haciendo que su inversi\u00f3n credikiva sea muy exitosa.  ","en":"From 6 a.m. until 10 pm. Monday through Sunday, Marta is attending her business of a general store where she sells supplies, snacks, liquor, meat, and groceries.  At her 18 years of age, she has unequaled experience and working ability.  Her customers are her neighbors and pedestrians who pass by the location of her business.  Her neighborhood is in the south of the city, where she lives with her husband and her 9-month-old daughter.  She is very well-known for the good service she offers her customers, whom she treats with a lot of respect.  Little by little, her clientele is increasing, and with it, so is the demand for her products, which she sells retail and turns over quickly.  Even though her competition is strong, she sustains herself in the market because she offers very competitive prices.  Her biggest challenge is always having what her customers need, which are basic goods that they can't wait for since the families consume them daily.  This is why her working capital has become insufficient to maintain a stock of merchandise and respond appropriately to the demand.  So, she has applied for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has had with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy supplies, groceries, and liquor in larger quantities so she can receive discounts.  She will then be able to increase her sales and profits.  Ever-rising prices are constant in her industry, so investing her Kiva loan will be very successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1107761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies, groceries, and liquor in large quantities and with cash.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91090},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103762},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106183},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108660},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111196},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113790},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116446},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119163},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121943},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137767}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.38,"local_amount":91090,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":91795.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338868},{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":103762,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":104565.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395419},{"amount":58.73,"local_amount":106183,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":107005.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775212},{"amount":60.1,"local_amount":108660,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":109501.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387202},{"amount":61.5,"local_amount":111196,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":112057.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994048},{"amount":125.81,"local_amount":227460,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":229221.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519288},{"amount":133.67,"local_amount":241679,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":243550.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497352},{"amount":77.42,"local_amount":139970,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":141053.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527184}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T21:03:25Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":433692,"name":"Yoel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Searching for opportunity and a better financial situation, Yoel emigrated from Cuba to the United States.

She will use the money from her first Kiva loan to buy supplies and ingredients in order to increase the opportunities in the market, such as responding to new customers that have been referred by the current buyers and those whose attention she wants to capture.  This is the reason she is asking for this Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy supplies in quantity, which will allow her to buy at a discount for cash and large volume.  She will pass these savings onto her customers, making her prices more competitive.  This is what the Kiva loan will allow, a successful investment.

Her husband is Wilfredo, who makes a living through being a security guard.  He is the father of her 7 children.  They live with the youngest, Kenny, 22, in their own home.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling candies and sweets at a stand that she put in her home with initial working capital that her husband gave her.  She first bought her products in small quantities, and she was able to sell all of it, which motivated her to keep buying and to continue with her business.  She started more than 6 years ao, and now she has her son's support in attending to the customers during his free time.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be rather profitable due to the demand for her products.  She likes what she does because she gets to attend to her customers, which means socializing with her neighbors and exchanging ideas.  The economic income also helps her support her husband with their home's expenses, since many times the income that he makes doesn't cover everything, and they have had difficulties paying for all of their expenses and their children's educational costs. By seeing the good results that she has had, she hopes to use her profits to finish her home and to fix up rooms to rent out, which will generate more economic income.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She is happy and thankful for the financial support that she receives.  She hopes to keep having it, which is why she promises to make all of her payments.  With the requested amount of 1,000 PEN, she will invest in the purchase of a larger quantity of candy to supply her stand.  She thinks that this will let her be more preferred by her customers.  She will also buy wood to finish building the rooms in her home to rent them out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1108377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy candy for her stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T03:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T03:30:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":163.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":177.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":184.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.4,"local_amount":153.06,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":155.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098983},{"amount":60.12,"local_amount":160.31,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":162.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401841},{"amount":62.01,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456122},{"amount":64.14,"local_amount":171.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":173.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451777},{"amount":131.33,"local_amount":350.22,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":355.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446961}],"funded_date":"2012-06-28T02:13:11Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":433806,"name":"Anamer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anamer is 41 years old and lives in Basirang, Tudela, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

She began this about five years ago with her own capital, buying in small amounts that grew as she saw the demand for her products.  It began as an idea from her sister-in-law who was excited to enter the business.  She considers it profitable enough for the earnings that it leaves her; she manages to sell all that she offers since she has become well-known in her town.  Before beginning her business she had financial difficulty because the expenses grew with the arrival of her second child and she wanted to offer them a better quality of life and a better education, in addition to helping her mother-in-law with the household expenses.  Therefore, seeing the good results that she is getting, she wishes to continue with her business and would like to use her earnings to buy her own home, where she wishes to open a small grocery store.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution.  She is very happy knowing that she will have financial support since this way she will feel sure about moving forward with her business.  Also, she feels at ease with her bank because she likes the support they offer to people with the desire to improve.

She is an enterprising and dynamic woman, as well as being friendly and happy. She is single, and lives with her parents and three siblings.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe works selling drinks from her home, and has a refrigerator to do so. She started this business two years ago with her own capital, which she obtained from her savings, buying small quantities of drinks and selling coal with her father. She thinks that her business is fairly profitable because of the demand for the drinks in the hot area where she lives, and she makes a good profit. Thanks to this she wants to continue with her business, extending it so that she can have a soda distribution business in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is Musy\u2019s second loan with the MFP institution. She is grateful for the financial support given, which helps her progress with her business. She is therefore committed to being punctual with her loan repayments, so that she has a good credit history. She also feels good about her communal bank, as she knows the members and thinks they are good people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1,000 nuevos soles, Musy plans to buy more sodas at wholesale prices. She also wants to buy more coal to sell in her father\u2019s stall in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1108438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She saw inmediate results and now has 5 computers, a scanner and a copier. She tends the store with her son. He works mornings and she works afternoons. She tells us that right now her biggest problem is crime and the wireless connection, which despite everything is very low. With the loan she hopes to buy more computers to grow her business with which she will increase her income and fix up her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1108440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He lives in his own home, located in a rural area of the M\u00f3rrope district. Most of the populated areas of this distrcit are considered to be rural with high rates of poverty. Its quality of life is precarious and limited. In the area where Carlos lives, the residents have potable water, but no electricity. \r\n\r\nCarlos sells animals, especially cattle, pork and goats. He raises them in pens located behind his house. He learned this activity from his parents several years ago and he knows the business perfectly. He sells in the towns of M\u00f3rrope and also makes deliveries from his home. During all this time, Carlos has acquired regular customers for his business. He also makes additional income with agricultural products.. \r\n\r\nCarlos wants to acquire balanced feed so that his animals can develop properly and be sold at a better price. For this, he is asking for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa. \r\n\r\nCarlos is a very responsible and hardworking person. Where he lives, his neighbors give very good references for him. He has had a loan from Kiva before. He is very grateful to the people that cooperate with him with this opportunity, since they have allowed him to make improvements on his home.

The quality of life of the residents of this area is humble, and many do not have even basic public utility services.\r\n\r\nFor the past year, she has dedicated herself to preparing and selling food, especially fried chicken and homemade desserts.  She makes the food in her home, and sells them right there to neighbors and acquaintances, also occasionally selling from her in-law\u2019s house.

The inhabitants of the area are mainly farmers and livestock breeders: this is a very hard-working community, and their standard of living is very poor, electricity being the only commodity.\r\n\r\nCintia has been engaged in breeding and selling small animals, such as sheep, turkeys and chickens for many years. Cintia raised her animals at home, in especially fit out pens, and she feeds them with balanced animal feed, grains and natural fodder; once they have reached a good size she sells them to shopkeepers and to neighbors of her area. This activity grants her a monthly income that she uses to help her husband in supporting their family\u2019s economy.

Together they have seven children who are now adults.  However, he always gives them his affection and his love as a father, the same as they give to him.  His house is in the city of Nazca, a city known for its hot climate.  You can also find the Nazca Lines in the city (huge drawings in the middle of an arid field that served as a calendar of the rains for the Nazca culture centuries ago), which receives a lot of tourists all year.  Agriculture is developed in Nazca, especially the cultivation of cactus pear, cotton, and corn, among others.\r\n\r\nWhen Nazario has free time he really likes to read.  He sometimes asks his wife to prepare one of his favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cSeco de Res\u201d (a traditional Peruvian dish like beef stew).  Due to the few financial resources that his parents had, he only has a primary school education.  However, he would have liked to have finished school and had a university degree.\r\n\r\nHe enthusiastically devotes himself to his cotton crops.  He works on his parcel of land around ten hours a day.  He believes that it is going very well for him in his business because he is very dedicated, and, above all, because God is always with him, and his faith is very strong.\r\n\r\nNazario is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the support they have given him he will be able to fertilize his cotton.  He will also buy products to cure his crops from pest infestations.  This way he will be able to have a good harvest, and he will have better income.

Several places with precarious and humble living conditions are concentrated in this district.  Most of them do not have all of the basic services.  In Blanca\u2019s case, her house only has electricity.\r\n\r\nShe currently raises and sells sheep.  She has a flock of sheep at her house, and she is raising them and feeding them natural grasses.  When the sheep reach an adequate weight, she sells them to her neighbors, to businessmen in the area, or at the local market.\r\n\r\nThe income that she gets from this business activity will allow her to help her husband with the financial support of her family.  Her husband is responsible for a parcel of land where he cultivates mango and staples products.\r\n\r\nBlanca wishes to get balanced feed for her sheep.  She wants them to develop in a better way, and she wants to be able to get improved income from her sales.
