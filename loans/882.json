school.\r\n\r\nWhen she separated from her partner, she went back to her work in retail trade to generate income and be able to contribute to the expenses of the household, such as the educational expenses and other basic needs for her nuclear family.\r\n\r\nShe sells products through a catalog (lingerie and cosmetics), and she collects according to the school schedule of her youngest daughter.  She makes her sales and collects when her daughter is in school, some days in the mornings and others in the afternoons.  \r\n\r\nMartha lives in a lower middle-class residential neighborhood located in Cartago province. She sells her products in neighborhoods close to her place of residence.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Martha has requested a loan, and she is doing it through the Fundacion on the recommendation of a good friend of hers who has been our client.  As head of household, Martha has had to confront obstacles, such as not having much time for her business because she must care for her daughters.

In time, she acquired experience and her children grew and everything became simpler.  However, her husband died a few months ago and she had to completely take over the coffee farm with help from her children but since they are already married they can\u2019t neglect their other activities.\r\n\r\nRosal\u00eda produces organic coffee which means she uses no chemicals to fertilize and she needs a loan to do the clearing tasks and to prepare the soil.

She sells fruits and vegetables as well as spit-roasted meat and general articles. She has been doing so for 10 years. She works Monday to Sunday from 8:30 to 10:30; her business operates in her own home. She buys her products from fruit and vegetable distributors, in supermarkets and from general articles distributors, since those sell them at a lower price, which means it is the best thing to do from an economic standpoint. With the loan she will buy fruits, vegetables and general articles such as hairgrips, toys, hair accessories and other accessories. One of her goals is to be able to restore her retail space, to have more to offer and to repaint the walls, buy new doors, redo the floor and lighting. Carla lives with her two children, aged 9 and 6. Her personal goals are to be more at ease with her business and to manage the profits well in order to have a better quality of life with her children. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, since it allowed her to invest in her business. She also feels very comfortable in the company of the other women entrepreneurs in her communal bank group, since they share various activities and interests, and the group provides a welcome distraction from everyday life. Thanks to the training imparted in group meetings, Carla learned to better manage her business. Talca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central part of the country. It is the administrative, economic and cultural centre of the region: it is the most important city of the Chilean central valley. A curious fact about Talca is the existence of a somewhat obscure phrase in Chile: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (\"Talca, Paris, and London\"). Several explanations of varying degrees of plausibility circulate about its origins. Some say that it derives from a comment uttered by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds almost identical to \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", and means \"Talca resembles London\"). Indeed, in the winter, an abundant fog often blankets the city, as happens in the capital of the United Kingdom."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1109042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Her house is located in the Ferroviaria sector, which has water, electricity, a sewer system, and paved roads. It is one of the few sectors to have basic utilities. She lives with her husband Jaime, who is a petrol station attendant in the city. Her 4 children are adults and married. Victoria started to sell products through catalogues at a young age, since she has always liked retail. She also did it in order to have enough income to meet her expenses. Nowadays, she has a small shop where she sells products such as sweets, snacks, yoghourt, etc. She minds the shop Monday to Saturday and one of her daughters accompanies her when she has to buy supplies. She likes her work because it keeps her active and provides a distraction. Victoria tells us that they have not had any problems with criminal activity but that she does face other challenges such as health problems, since she had an incipient bronchitis a while ago.

The house where she lives in her own and is built of cement. It only has water and electricity services. It is not strange in this city to only have this type of service as the authorities care very little about improving living conditions. Despite this Judy has a shop where she sells general products and offers a sewing service to individuals. She started this business due to her split with her partner as she had to care for her children and so started her sewing service.\r\n\r\nThree years ago she was able to collect enough money to open a mini market. She tells us that she serves in the shop alone although sometimes her children help her in their free time. She opens from 8 in the morning until 9 at night. Judy has high hopes that her business will increase as it is her means of sustenance for her and her children, as her ex does not help her economically. Her children are 11, 13 and 16 years old and attend school. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she has thought about buy stock for her shop and with this increase in sales improve her shop; she will also support her children until they attend university."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1109052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks, rice, household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy Geomar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":848.52,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":71.12},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":74.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":432290,"name":"Junaydullo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0427\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u0415\u043c\u0443 59 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 8 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0427\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u044e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0427\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432.

The community is composed of several population centers with groups of a maximum of 15 to 20 families.  His is called Punto Nueve.  In his community everyone subsists from farming activities.  His dwelling is made from rustic materials.\r\n\r\nHe works raising small farm animals in his back yard.  When they reach a good level of development he offers them for sale at home to his neighbors and to merchants who periodically visit the zone where he lives.  Oscar raises barnyard fowl like turkeys, ducks, chicks, chickens, etc.  He also raises cattle, sheep and pigs.  Income earned from this activity is used to cover family expenses.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Oscar wants to expand his business with the purchase of more animals.

Today, thanks to her hard work and dedication her business has grown to include 3 cows, 2 horses, 20 heads of small-horned cattle and it brings in around 3,000 soms a month from the sale of milk products. \r\n\r\nHoping to expand her business further, Klara approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 90,000 in order to purchase cattle intended for fattening and resale. She plans to invest profits from the loan back into the business.

En un principio trabajaba con su padre y tiempo despu\u00e9s, gracias a sus ahorros, pudo comprar un terreno para empezar a producir su propio caf\u00e9 y ser independiente. El actualmente tiene 39 a\u00f1os y gracias a la experiencia adquirida ha logrado que sus fincas tengan una buena producci\u00f3n. Durante la \u00faltima cosecha entreg\u00f3 un total de 24 toneladas a la \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d con la finalidad de que su caf\u00e9 sea exportado. \u00c9l es un productor org\u00e1nico, es decir, no utiliza fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos lo cual a lo largo del tiempo le trae beneficios al medio ambiente. La meta de V\u00edctor es que dentro de un periodo de 3 a\u00f1os sus tierras produzcan la cantidad de 50 toneladas, es decir, el doble de lo que obtiene actualmente y para ello necesita comprar planta de caf\u00e9, pues cuenta con el espacio suficiente para sembrarla y es por esta raz\u00f3n que el necesita de un cr\u00e9dito. V\u00edctor tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y a la cr\u00eda de cerdos, actividades que le han sido de gran ayuda sobre todo en los a\u00f1os que el caf\u00e9 ha tenido un precio bajo en el mercado. Debido a su enorme gusto por el caf\u00e9 a V\u00edctor le gustar\u00eda poner en un futuro una cafeter\u00eda para poder vender all\u00ed parte de su producci\u00f3n y para que sus familiares y amigos puedan disfrutar cuando gusten de una rica taza de caf\u00e9.","en":"Since he left school at 15, V\u00edctor has been a coffee grower. At the beginning he worked with his father, and some time later, thanks to his savings, he was able to buy a piece of land to begin producing his own coffee and be independent. \r\n\r\nNow he is 39, and thanks to the experience he has acquired he has managed to secure good production from his plantations. During the last harvest, he delivered a total of 24 tons to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d with the aim of having his coffee exported. \r\n\r\nHe is an organic producer, that is to say, he does not use chemical fertilizers, which over time benefits the environment. V\u00edctor's goal is, within a period of three years, to have his lands produce the amount of 50 tons; that is to say, double what he currently gets. For this reason, he needs to buy coffee seedlings, as he has enough space to plant them and this why he needs a loan. \r\n\r\nV\u00edctor also produces sugar cane and raises pigs, activities that have helped him greatly, especially in the years that coffee has had a low market price. Due to his very great liking for coffee, V\u00edctor would like to set up a coffee shop some day, in order to be able to sell part of his production there, and so that his family members and friends can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee whenever they like."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1108340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair

Luis ha empezado con poco capital y por esta raz\u00f3n tiene poca mercader\u00eda para ofrecer a sus clientes y pese a ello se ha sabido mantener. Quiere realizar una inversi\u00f3n para ampliar su negocio, comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda principalmente ropa de mujer que es la de mayor demanda. Con ello piensa incrementar su cartera de clientes y as\u00ed mejorar sus ingresos y calidad de vida.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es poder tener un gran local y quiz\u00e1s abrir varios y as\u00ed convertirse en un gran empresario.\n","en":"Luis is a single young man of 24 years who lives with his sister and grandparents, Gladys and Luis, who are 55 and 63 years old, respectively. They live in \"San Miguel de Los Bancos\" in the province of Pichincha, where the capital of Ecuador is also found. One of the principal resources of San Miguel de Los Bancos is its water, as there are countless rivulets and small waterfalls that originate in this territory and give rise to rivers of considerable size. San Miguel de Los Bancos exhibits the characteristics common to several towns located between the Sierra and the Coast: commercial traffic unfolds along the main street where you can find hotels, restaurants, and department stores. Above all there are products from farming and livestock, as well as veterinary services and shops for the daily needs of the population.\r\n\r\nOne year ago Luis opened a small casual clothing store across from a busy restaurant. He waits on his customers 9 hours a day and is helped by his sister. He learned this work from his family, who have also been working in this type of business for several years. Luis started with little capital, and for this reason he has little merchandise to offer his customers, and despite this he has known how to persevere. He wants to make an investment to expand his business and buy more merchandise, mainly women's clothing, which has the greatest demand. With that he plans to increase his portfolio of customers and in this way improve his income and quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to have a big store and open several of them, and in this way become a great businessman.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1109090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

completely finished but that\u2019s where they have their meetings.  When we asked the group why it was called La Huerta, they answered laughing: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have an orchard anymore but we used to meet in a huge orchard where there was lots of fruit like apples, pears, figs, lemons, etc.  But now look where we are.\u201d  The members of the group are very grateful and happy with VisionFund (FRAC) and with Kiva because they will be able to invest in their activities.  For example:  Do\u00f1a Reyna will buy bedspreads and blankets, Do\u00f1a Silvia and Alma Jazm\u00edn will buy crafts, Jos\u00e9 will buy jewelry, \u00c1ngela will invest in painting napkins and finally, Don Leonardo will buy belts but also will invest in his sheep.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Petra who also belongs to the group tells us that she\u2019s 46-years-old and a widow with two dependents still, a girl and  boy; the girl is still attending secondary school and the boy is no longer in school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Petra tells us that she works making crafts like sashes and napkins.  Petra learned how to make these crafts from her mother.  She tells us that in order to make the sashes she needs yarn.  She buys the entire skein and then unravels the individual threads and then embroiders again so that the sash will end up embroidered; in addition to the sashes she also does napkins.\r\n\r\nPetra tells us that the only difficulty she has is being able to buy her supplies sometimes which is why she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy yarn and embroidery fabric.  The loan will be very beneficial because she will be able to stock up for a good period of time.  Petra says that what she likes best is to make them so her customers will be satisfied with what she does.  Petra always sells outside the gates but would like it if her business grew gradually so as not to need to come all the way to San Felipe to sell any longer.\r\n\r\nPetra is very grateful for the loan because her profits will be of much use to her to cover household expenses and her children\u2019s schooling.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1107597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Jazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419095},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568671},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399961},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407626}],"funded_date":"2012-06-14T05:21:59Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":433959,"name":"Dhorke","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dhorka is a hard-working woman in her early seventies with seven grown children and 24 grandchildren.

Only Damaris and Eduardo are supported by her; her other children live with her but are already married. Marce is very happy because her children help her with her business. The thing she likes best is making tamales, and going out in the streets of her community to sell. She said that since she was young she has enjoyed selling things, managing her time and her money, but that now it is different because she is working to be able to give a better life to her children and above all to give them a better education.

He is married and the father of five children. He started his business with his personal savings and has made it profitable, in part because he is in a good location with many residents who are attracted by low-cost housing. The main challenges he faces are fluctuating prices and the high cost of materials. He would like to increase the capacity of his cafe because that would maximize his income. He was introduced to Yehu by his friends and is applying for a loan for 15,000 Kenyan shillings to buy food stock of maize flour, wheat flour, rice and sugar. His ambition is to turn his caf\u00e9 into a world class hotel in the near future, and he believes that the additional income made possible by this loan will help him improve his family\u2019s living standards.

Martha is a single mother, in spite of the adversities that have come up in her life she has been able to get through, together with her daughter. She has always been a fighter and a hard working woman. In her spare time she likes to knit wool sweaters for her daughter and some family members, and in some occasions she prepares a delicious \"caucau\", her and her daughter's favorite dish. With a lot of hard work she finished her secondary education. Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources she wasn't able to go to the university, but she would have liked a lot to study Accounting. Thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit and the support of her sisters, over a year ago, Martha set up her business selling broaster chicken and selling clothes. She dedicates about 13 hours a day to her business, which allows her to service up to 35 customers. She believes her business is doing well, thanks to her cooking skills and talent for sales, as well as her kind disposition and good customer service. Martha is very thankful to Kiva lenders since thanks to the help provided by them she will be able to purchase merchandise such as: polo shirts, sweaters, pants and blouses among others. In this way she will be able to supply her clothes selling business and increase her financial income, which she hopes, further on in the future, will allow her to buy a sandwich cart she will use to continue working and accomplish her big dream of having a house of her own and help her daughter become a fine, professional

They don\u2019t know what the name of their group means either, or why they named it thus, but now they like it very much.\r\n\r\nThe Sinai group is very happy and grateful to have been granted the loan and it will help  them very much to invest in their activities such as Petronila\u2019s and Maria de la Luz\u2019s grocery store, Matilde\u2019s baby clothing, Jose\u2019s clothing for women and men, Antonio, Sofia, Tomas and Leo in jewelry, Jesus in household appliances, Abelina in her stationery store, and Angelica in household items. \r\n\r\nMartha is also a part of the Sinai group. She tells us that she is 49 years old, married to Alfonso for 30 years, and has no dependent children as they are already married adults outside her household.\r\n\r\nWe note that for 10 years she has been selling plastic products such as spoons, glasses, dishes, etc. She tells us that the only difficulty that she has had was when she had to roam about as she was tired a lot, but now that she has a stable location she does not have to battle the road.\r\n\r\nMartha tells us that in the future she would like her business to expand and her earnings to increase more and more, for the quality of life for her and the children too, and she would like to improve her housing and she always has wanted to have a pretty house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7150,"image":{"id":1108546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics

llamada San Isidro Boxipe una comunidad muy tranquila, el d\u00eda que vistamos al grupo estaba festejando la fiesta m\u00e1s grande de su pueblo que es el santo San Isidro, algunas integrantes del grupo participan en la danza de la comunidad.\nEl nombre del grupo lo eligieron ya que estaban en un grupo grande de 41 integrantes que tuvieron que dividir en dos por eso el nombre de Divisi\u00f3n y Hanrrora por el lugar donde viven, una parte se quedo con el nombre de Hanrrora y este grupo se quedo con el nombre de Divisi\u00f3n Hanrrora.\nDo\u00f1a Catalina una integrante del grupo nos cuenta que ella tiene mucho tiempo trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n, ella tiene 66 a\u00f1os ya es una se\u00f1ora viuda  hace poco viv\u00eda sola pero enfermo y uno de sus hijos se vino a vivir con ella para cuidarla, Do\u00f1a Catalina se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos desde hace 30 a\u00f1os la idea de iniciar la actividad le naci\u00f3 sola ya que en la comunidad la mayor\u00eda se dedica a la cr\u00eda de borregos nos cuenta que los cuida mucho, les da de comer para que crezcan grandes y gordas para que a la hora de vender puedan pag\u00e1rselos a un buen precio.\nUna de las dificultades mas grandes es cuando sus borregos enferman y mueren nos cuenta que hace poco murieron 5 borregos estaba muy triste ya que fue una gran p\u00e9rdida perder 5 borregos al mismo tiempo no es nada f\u00e1cil, sin embargo comenta que hace poco le trato de arreglar el corral donde los tenia poni\u00e9ndoles un alambr\u00f3n que los resguarda mejor.\nLa meta que tiene Do\u00f1a Catalina es llegar  a tener  masa barreritas es por eso que esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar 5 borregos y un poco de alimento para sus borregos, siempre ha querido ver su corral lleno de borregos entre grandes y peque\u00f1os.\nNos comenta que sus ganancias le ayudan para seguir comprando mas borregos pero tambi\u00e9n ayudan  mejorar su calidad de vida para comprarse cosas que necesita como zapateos, ropa, alimentaci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n invierte una parte para sacer adelante sus terrenos que tiene que sembrar ma\u00edz. Y de los pagos con la instituci\u00f3n le ayudan sus hijos que ya trabajan. \nEl grupo est\u00e1 conformado por otras nueve mujeres que son Austreberta, Irma, Teresa, Juliana y Mar\u00eda Eva son se\u00f1oras que invertir\u00e1n su cr\u00e9dito comprando borregos para cr\u00eda y engorda. Mientras que las se\u00f1oras Eloisa, Aurora, Eva compraran alimento para sus borregos entre pastura, zacate, ma\u00edz y alimento para sus borregos. Finamente la se\u00f1ora Lucia comprara pollos, guajolotes y borregos para cr\u00eda y engorda. En fin todas las integrantes invertir\u00e1n en sus actividades pero todas est\u00e1n muy agradecidas con el cr\u00e9dito ya que siempre han sido de gran beneficio.\n","en":"The group \u201cHanrrora Division\u201d is located in the tranquil San Isidro Boxipe community. The day we visited the group their town was celebrating their biggest holiday for Saint Isidor. Some of the members of the group participated in the dance.\r\nThey chose the name of the group because there were already 41 members and a division was necessary and they chose to name it after their town. One portion was named Hanrrora and this group was named Hanrrora Division.\r\nMrs. Catalina is a member of the group and she tells us she has been working with the institution for lots of time now. She is 66 years old, widowed, and until recently lived alone since she got sick and one of her sons comes to look after her. Mrs. Catalina raises sheep for 30 years now. She decided to start the business alone since it is a common business in the community. She takes care of them, fattens them up so they grow a certain size, and sells them at a reasonable price.\r\nOne of the biggest difficulties is when her sheep get sick and die. She tells us that recently 5 have died and she is very sad since it is a hard hit loosing 5 at once. Recently she has fixed the corral she keeps them in to protect them better. \r\nMrs. Catalina\u2019s goal is to have more sheep and is requesting the loan to buy 5 more and feed. She has always wanted to see her corral filled with both large and small sheep. \r\nShe comments that her income helps her buy more sheep and improve her life quality like buying things she needs such as shoes, clothes, food, and maintain the corn crops she has on the side. Her sons will help her pay back the loan since they work.\r\nThe group is formed by new members: Austreberta, Irma, Teresa, Juliana y Mar\u00eda Eva. They will use the loan to buy sheep to raise and sell. Mrs. Eloisa, Aurora, Eva will buy feed, grass, and corn. Finally, Mrs. Lucia will buy chickens, turkeys, and sheep to raise. In the end, the members will invest in their businesses and they are all thankful with the loans since they are always a great help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1103257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Dona tells us, \u201c I would really like to support my daughter so she can attend a university and get a job. I would also like to fix my house since it is incomplete. The floors still need tile and the outside still needs to be flattened.

","en":"Kalbubu is 46 years old.  18 years ago Kalbubu started farming and raising livestock as the main source of income for her family. Thanks to Kalbubu's hard work and persistence, the business that she has started with the initial sum of 10,000 som currently includes 2 cows, 1 heifer and 1 calf and brings in an income of around 10,000 som per month.

She has always been a very hard-working woman.  With great effort she completed her university studies.  Unfortunately due to a lack of resources she was unable to study gastronomy, but she dreams of being able to do so one day.  In her free time she likes to watch television with her children and occasionally spoil her family by preparing a delicious \"Cau Cau\".  Thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit and her desire to get ahead, she has a business growing prickly pear and selling cochineal.  She works at her business for about 9 hours a day, and also works doing mobile food sales in the afternoons.  She is very happy with her  businesses as she has always liked the countryside and the work that is done in it.  Rosa is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because due to the help they provide she can cover the cost of harvesting her prickly pear crop, such as nutrients and fertilizer, and also be able to have her crop infested with cochineal. Her crop will then be adequately prepared for subsequent harvests and she will be able to increase her income as a result of her sales.  Little by little Rosa hopes to save enough money to buy her own property where she can own a restaurant.

The members of the group decided to name it this because close to their town there is a small Virgin of Guadalupe chapel.  This is the story of Mrs. Julia, one of the members of the group.  She is 55 years old and married to Mr. Paulo who works in the countryside.  They have 3 children whom are already married.  She has a small grocery store which she has been working for the last 25 years.  She lives in the community of Cuajinicuilapa.  This is the community where the \"Museum of Afro-Mestizo\" cultures is located, which was previously known as the \"Museum of the Third Race\".  This is the first museum in Mexico dedicated to the descendents of the African slaves in Mexico and their history.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Julia decided to start with this business because one of her sons who lives abroad suggested it and supported her so that she could start the small store.  She will invest her loan into the purchase of more merchandise such as: soft drinks, milk, eggs, oil, rice, beans, sugar, nescafe, toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, etc.\r\n\r\nThe dream that she has is to continue investing in her business so that she can increase the size of her store.  She was also thinking of starting to sell corn, in addition to buying another refrigerator and two more shelves to display more merchandise. \r\n\r\nShe mentions that she appreciates Fundacion Realidad and Kiva for their support and the loan which they are providing.  Thanks to the loan her business will start to improve, and so will her life and that of her family as well.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group and the activities that they participate in consist of the following:  Lourdes - sells cheese; Maximina- sweet shop; Leonila - sells corn; Julia- groceries; Gracias - sells soft drinks; Maria Isabel- sells chicken; Elizabeth - sells shoes; Reyna - butcher shop; Alfredo - soft drink store.

They work in different economic activities, and they want to improve their businesses and their lives. They are from Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca.

She is known for being a quiet and kind person. She is happily married to Se\u00f1or Roberto, with whom she has two children, \u00c1ngel David and a recently born baby. Her business, which she began six years ago, is selling tamales and bread. The tamales she makes are of chicken, pork, clams, and chipiles (a leafy vegetable). She sells them in the neighborhoods close to her community and goes from house to house every day. What she likes most about her work is that it gives her good earnings, and when there are leftover tamales, she heats them and sells them at another time, so that she doesn't lose what she invests. Alma Delia is requesting this loan to buy more ingredients to prepare tamales: green chiles, dried chiles, garlic, onion, chicken, pork, banana leaves, and lard. She is very thankful to the Vision Fund since with its support and her earnings, her life and business have improved.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Albina, who sells tortillas; Juliana, who sells handicrafts; Martina, who sells Mexican snacks; Elvira, who sells Mexican snacks; Ana Magali, who sells chickens; Luz Martina, who sells chickens; Catalina, who sells chickens; Belem, who sells chickens; Flora, who sells perfume; Avelina, who sells footwear; Ynocencia, who sells food; Maria, who sells fruits and vegetables; Iris Isaura, who sells Mexican snacks; Francisca, who sells tortillas; Berenice, who sells Mexican snacks; and Jos\u00e9, who sells bread.

On Saturdays and Sundays she goes to the town\u2019s traffic circle. And on Mondays the best place is a bridge in the market area. In this way Judith ensures that she makes lots of sales. She wishes to put her business on a more sound footing and increase sales.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP. She is grateful for the support and opportunity. It is also the first time she has joined with a group of women who share the same interests. The group is called Los Amigos Capelinos Community Bank. With the loan money Judith will buy oranges, avocados, mandarins etc. at wholesale prices to sell at her stalls."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1107657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-06T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-06T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.54,"local_amount":68.86,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":74.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098978},{"amount":31.27,"local_amount":78.16,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":84.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401836},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":166.58,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":179.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451773},{"amount":36.32,"local_amount":90.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":98.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446957},{"amount":38.24,"local_amount":95.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":103.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052865}],"funded_date":"2012-06-07T04:21:04Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":433186,"name":"Rosalva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosalva de 44 a\u00f1os vive con su grupo familiar conformado por su esposo,  3 hijos: Karla, Alba y Manfredi, los primeros  dos estudian en la Universidad y el \u00faltimo de 16 a\u00f1os estudia el bachillerato, sus hijos tambi\u00e9n colaboran con la atenci\u00f3n del negocio.

The first two study in the university and the last, a 16 year old, is in high school.  Her children also help out by attending to the business.  They are the ones for whom Rosalva fights and works hard day after day to try to get ahead.  She is a determined person, and through her efforts wants to propel her children to be professionals so that they have greater opportunities in life.  Currently she has a store where she sells basic goods like eggs, oil, and cooking grease, among other items.  Her husband also has a car wash business.  Together they are a very responsible, hard-working pair.  Rosalva's store is located within her own home. She would like to expand it, meaning sell things like clothes, shoes, and other products she doesn't currently have which her clients ask for.  For this reason, she is requesting this loan through INTEGRAL; to buy both men's and women's clothes, as well as more basic food goods like oil, milk, eggs, and beans.  She is sure that with the earnings gained she will be able to pay back the loan on time and give her family a better life.\r\n\r\nRosalva de 44 a\u00f1os vive con su grupo familiar conformado por su esposo,  3 hijos: Karla, Alba y Manfredi, los primeros  dos estudian en la Universidad y el \u00faltimo de 16 a\u00f1os estudia el bachillerato, sus hijos tambi\u00e9n colaboran con la atenci\u00f3n del negocio.

It is towards this dream that Maria puts much time and effort in her current business. \r\n\r\nMaria will use this new loan to buy more chickens\u2026 and a goat!

Desde muy joven y durante 11 a\u00f1os,  se dedic\u00f3 a la actividad comercial en su natal Villanueva, municipio en el departamento de La Guajira al norte de Colombia. Por eso cuando lleg\u00f3 a la ciudad de Barranquilla, organiz\u00f3 un ciber-caf\u00e9 , en el que obtuvo una experiencia de 2 a\u00f1os, para posteriormente emprender con la distribuci\u00f3n de pescados y mariscos en otro municipio muy cercano a la ciudad, pues lo consider\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s rentable; all\u00ed  consigui\u00f3 buenos clientes  y logr\u00f3 estabilizarse en \u00e9l, desde el mismo momento en que se traslad\u00f3  al municipio donde actualmente  habita. Su negocio lo realiza con instituciones importantes, como  un batall\u00f3n militar y cl\u00ednicas, a las que le provisiona de pescados y mariscos para el consumo de su poblaci\u00f3n objeto. Los pagos de estos productos los recibe mensualmente y compra con una frecuencia diaria. En su negocio participan activamente sus dos hijos, que son parte de toda esta tarea, que proporciona  diariamente a estas familias la posibilidad de tener cada vez m\u00e1s,  bienestar en sus hogares. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y es un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 pescados y mariscos en mayor volumen que el usualmente acostumbrado. Con esta inversi\u00f3n de credikiva ganar\u00e1 descuentos y extender\u00e1 su mercado a nuevos clientes que cada vez mas crecen y esto es gracias a que solo vende productos del  mar frescos y saludables,   raz\u00f3n por la cual todo el que los consume, le refieren nuevos compradores y por eso su demanda crece. El mayor desaf\u00edo de Elisa, es tener un suficiente capital de trabajo para diversificar su negocio y agregar otros productos, como queso, carnes fr\u00edas, suero,  que se venden de contado y con los cuales ella aprovechar\u00eda el actual segmento de mercado, que no ha satisfecho esta demanda y cuando ella lo logre se aumentar\u00e1n aun mas sus ingresos, tal como ella sue\u00f1a.  ","en":"Elisa is 68, lives in a town very close to the city, and is a widow and mother of two children ages 37 and 38.  Since she was very young, and for 11 years, she made a living through commercial activity in her native Villanueva, a town in the department of La Guajira to the north of Colombia.  This is why when she came to the city of Barranquilla, she organized a cybercafe in which she had two years of experience.  Later, she undertook the distribution of fish and seafood in another town close to the city because she considered it to be more profitable.  There she attained good customers and managed to stabilize her business, at the same time that she moved to the town where she currently lives.  Her business works with important institutions, like a military battalion and clinics, to which she provides fish and seafood for the consumption of their target population.  She receives monthly payment for these products and buys on a daily frequency.  Her two children actively participate in her business and are part of this whole task, which provides these families daily with the possibility of having more and more welfare in their homes.  \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and it is a Kiva loan, which she will use to buy fish and seafood in a greater volume than she is accustomed to.  With the investment of this Kiva loan she will earn discounts and will extend her market to new customers, who will cause it to increasingly grow.  This is thanks to the fact that she only sells fresh and healthful seafood products; the reason for which everyone who consumes them then refers new buyers and causes her demand to grow.  The biggest challenge that Elisa faces is having enough working capital to diversify her business and add more products like cheese, frozen meats, and whey, which she would sell for cash and use to take advantage of the current market segment which has not yet satisfied its demand.  When she achieves this, her income will increase further just as she has dreamed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1108984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Her market is located in the neighborhood where she lives and is aimed at serving the surrounding areas, where little by little she is becoming better known for the quality of the food and drinks she offers and for the freshness of her fruit and base ingredients, and also because her business is located across from a very popular fast food business operating in the area, which boosts her sales. \r\nHer mother and her aunt help her with her business, because her customer base is growing and there are times of the day which become critical: the number of customers increases and, accordingly, so do her sales.\r\nHer production process is very traditional. She still grinds the corn with a manual mill, which is why she requires a more effective work tool, such as an electric mill, which would substantially improve time efficiency and would increase output. She also needs to purchase input materials at a better price and in larger quantities, so that she can become more competitive. Actually, her working capital is her greatest challenge in achieving her productivity goal. \r\nThis is why she is requesting a Kiva loan, which she will use to acquire an electric mill and to purchase oil, corn, sugar, salt, and other ingredients in cash and in larger quantities than usual.\r\nHer Kiva loan will be a successful investment because it is aimed at increasing her business' productivity and competitive capability, so that she can gradually expand and generate a sustainable income that will provide for her young children's wellbeing.

This is how he began leasing it out as a vehicle repair shop but because his tenant failed to make the monthly payments, he decided to use it himself as he had slowly got to known the drivers and vehicle owners. He therefore opened his parking lot, where he rents a space to each vehicle under his care. His idea had an impact on his target customers and he has gradually perfected it with the daily income from 40 vehicles, who are regular customers and others who pay for a spot in a secure place by the hour or by the day.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is when the rain comes as his lot doesn't have a cover and he does not have enough working capital to fit a roof over the entire parking lot and protect all his customers' vehicles. This means that he cannot increase the parking price and he is behind his competition. He is currently applying for a credikiva which he use to put a cover on the parking lot, potentially increasing his customers and charging the average market price, which will not leave him behind his competition. His credikiva will be a success because the price will be adapted according to the specifications of the customers that Hernando wants to attract - those who keep their vehicles a long way from their
