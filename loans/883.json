She lives to the southwest of the city, where she has a commercial business.  She has a variety shop that carries the name of her two children; this reminds her daily that her goal is to work in a disciplined and persistent way so that she can see her children become successful people.  She started her business is 2007, when she decided to look for a way to generate income through an independent activity.  With 200,000 Colombian pesos and a small glass display case, financed with money that she had saved from the household budget, she started her entrepreneurial adventure.  Now her business is located in a suitable space where she has 3 glass display cases, 3 computers, a photocopier and other equipment.  With this business, she has managed to support herself and her 2 children.  There she sells stationery items, women's accessories, home accents, sweets and snacks.  Her goal for the future is to buy a store on the main street where it is busy with a lot of commerce, and expand her inventory and her sales capacity.

He is 38, and came to the city of Barranquilla from San Antero en C\u00f3rdoba, one of the main livestock-raising departments in Colombia. \r\n\r\nWhen he as 17, he signed on as a worker in food warehouses in the city. That was where he acquired his major entrepreneurial experience and knowledge of the ever-changing market, especially in the sales area. So three years later, he managed to go it alone and create his own venture with which to earn money independently. This was how, with his savings from his work as an employee, he bought a small shop in an area of the city's public market and supplied himself with disposable products such as bags, glasses, plates, cutlery, spoons, straws, etc. \r\n\r\nSubsequently he fitted up a refreshment stand that has produced new income for him and which he also wants to make grow, due to the potential clientele  centering around his business location. His main customers are restaurants and soft drink sellers, such as what they call on the coast, \u201craspao\u201d, a well-known shaved ice with natural fruit flavors, such as tamarind, lemon, orange, etc. His customers also include stores selling brown sugar loaf, fruit sellers who buy plastic bags, and other companies that buy these products in various quantities and specifications. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to someday become a wholesaler of disposable products, but his great challenge is not having sufficient working capital to really achieve it. This is why he is applying for a credikiva loan, with which he will buy plastic bags, disposable party items, as well as soft drinks and other beverages for supplying his refreshment stand. \r\n\r\nWith this, he is on his way to gradually achieving his growth objectve, and this thanks to his credikiva, the first loan he is taking out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Two years ago, Martha started a business selling food, juices, and sweets on a piece of land given to her by her parents.

Esta condici\u00f3n ha hecho que gane todos los d\u00edas mucha mas clientela y por eso tambi\u00e9n ha logrado tener dos locales o puntos de ventas, uno de los cuales atiende su c\u00f3nyuge; con estos negocios ambos,  han logrado generar ingresos, para el sostenimiento de su hogar y especialmente para pagar a educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Su meta mas adelante es tener su propia casa, pues actualmente su familia habita en casa de su abuela materna y su mayor sue\u00f1o es tener su vivienda.  Su esmero en trabajar todos los d\u00edas, se hace muy evidente pues todo lo que gana lo invierte en generar ingresos; \u00faltimamente est\u00e1 vendiendo queso y suero, aprovechando que en sus tres a\u00f1os como comerciante, conoce mucho el mercado p\u00fablico donde est\u00e1 ubicada;  por eso da cr\u00e9dito a personas que ya conoce y que lo compran para vender estos productos l\u00e1cteos m\u00e1s adelante y para el consumo de sus familias; con este \u00faltimo negocio, genera ingresos adicionales, con los que aumenta cada vez mas el bienestar de su familia y por eso ante la demanda no solo de las frutas, las verduras sino tambi\u00e9n de su queso y suero, su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente, para responder a su clientela. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprara\u2019 al por mayor, frutas, verduras, con los cuales aumentar\u00e1 su capital de trabajo y ser\u00e1 suficiente para invertir con las utilidades que le produzca su inversi\u00f3n credikiva, en queso y suero; la que promete ser exitosa, porque la hace en el marco de la demanda del mercado, conoce bien las necesidades de su  clientela  y con ella genera una rentabilidad no menor del 29 % y le proporciona  un margen de contribuci\u00f3n del 57%. ","en":"Eliana, age 37, has four children from the ages of 9 to 15.  She works persistently in her own business in the heart of Barranquilla.  She sells very fresh tropical fruits and vegetables in large volume.  She sells things like tomatoes, onions, carrots, cucumbers, beets, potatoes, 'lulo' (a native fruit), melon, passion fruit, and everything that is produced in the harvest of each season.\r\n\r\nBecause of this she wins over a lot more customers every day.  Also, she has managed to have two points of sales.  Her husband tends to one of them.  With these businesses they have both managed to generate income to support her household and especially to pay for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to have her own house.  Her family currently lives with her maternal grandmother.  Her greatest dream is to have a house.  She works carefully every day, and that makes it very evident that everything she earns is invested in generating income.  Lately she has been selling cheese and whey, taking advantage of her three years as a merchant.  She knows a lot about the public market where she is.  That is why she gives credit to people she knows so that they can buy these dairy products to later sell or use for their family\u2019s consumption.\r\n\r\nWith this last business she generates additional income, which increases her family\u2019s well-being every day.  However, she has insufficient working capital to meet her customers\u2019 demand for fruit, vegetables, cheese, and whey.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy wholesale fruits and vegetables.  This will increase her working capital, and there will be enough profits produced by her Kiva loan to invest in cheese and whey.    This promises to be successful because she does it within the framework of the market demand.  She knows her customers\u2019 needs very well .  She generates a profitability of no less than 29% and a contribution margin of 57%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1108972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She also offers electronic load (pre-paid cell phone credits) business and also operates a tailoring business. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

At age 19, she completed high school and continued on to university to try to become a computer systems analyst, and she hopes to finish her degree this year. She also sells scrap metal and other recyclables, which allows her to support herself. With her income, she has also been able to pay for her university studies. Her goal is to expand this business as she is currently facing one of the biggest challenges in her life, supporting her family, especially because when her mother suffers a relapse, Cindy is the one who needs to take over her business. She is currently requesting a loan in order to increase her chances of purchasing recyclables because her business requires that she have enough money to buy and sell immediately. This is why she now turns to Kiva for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She opened the business because she has always liked doing business, but since she was a housewife she wasn't able to develop herself that way.Talking to her husband one day she got the idea and with some capital they had saved up they started. At first it was difficult to find customers but over time they became better known. The hardware store has been running for 4 years and it is going very well for them. Rosario tends to it and when her daughter visits she helps her with the cleaning and serving customers. The locale is open every day from morning to night and has had no problems so far. Rosario wants to take out the loan to buy some complete toolboxes. Her dream is to add on to her house and her business to make it bigger and more spacious.

He tells us that in spite of the great progress made in recent years from tourism, Playas still lacks economic development.  For example, he tells us that in spite of having his own house made of cement with water and electrical utilities,  there is no sewer and the roads are not paved.  In spite of this, he has been working as a baker for 21 years.  He started this work in his uncle's neighborhood that had a bakery; they hired him to help with production and sales.  He is grateful for this training, because now this is the way he earns his living and supports his family.  He now has a store in his house where he works each day from 7am until 9 at night.  Vincente tells us that when he started the business it was very profitable, because the products he made were very economical.  Now with the increase in prices it is less profitable. Therefore, he focuses on numbers: the more he produces and sells, the greater his earnings.  He is hoping to obtain a loan so that he can buy raw materials to make the bread which will help his business, allowing him to hire an assistant in the near future.

This was when she made a bet on some numbers and won her first working capital, with which she bought some small home appliances and various other items for the home such as bed sheets, tablecloths and other home furnishings.  Twenty years ago, she worked doing domestic washing and ironing, and seven years ago she joined a cooperative of a variety of trades where she still works.  Over the last 2 years, she has managed to simultaneously consolidate a market among her colleagues and the company to which the cooperative provides its services.  They order products that she sells on credit and her customers pay in installments at terms adjusted to their circumstances.\r\n\r\nFatima belongs to a family group with her husband and 5 children aged 16 to 27, who she dreams of seeing become successful people in whatever they do.

","en":"Rakhat is 40 years old, married, and has three children, the youngest of which is 3 years old. Early this year, in search of a source of income for her family, she used a starting sum of 28,000 som (KGS) to open a business selling groceries. Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Rakhat's business now brings in a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS). Her inventory is currently limited, so Rakhat turned to Bai - Tushum & Partners for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan. Rakhat plans to invest the resulting revenues into development of her business.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nFernando was introduced to textiles by his uncles. He says, \"My artistic origins come from my family. My uncles worked in textiles and little by little they introduced me to this world. I love being able to translate materials into beautiful products. My work means everything to me: it's what I love and cherish, and I love the fact that it allows me to provide for my family. I consider myself a happy person and every day I strive to get ahead, not only in work, but also as a human being, a husband, and a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud to be an artisan, and I am proud to have been born in a land such as Peru that is so rich in culture and tradition. It is here where alpacas are bred, and their fleece has been used since the days of our Inca ancestors to make clothes. Today I have the opportunity to preserve this custom by designing apparel. On top of that, this great door has been opened for us to show customers around the world this rich tradition of ours. Thank you for appreciating what is ours, and for your support in helping me grow my business with this interest-free microcredit.

This has provided him with the opportunity to generate new income. Meanwhile, Juma can earn extra money. \r\n\r\nThe lack of working capital in the face of Juma\u2019s dreams is his biggest challenge. This is why he has turned to Kiva credit and his first loan with Yehu Microfinance Trust. With his Kiva credit, Juma will buy sacks of charcoal which are in high demand during this rainy season and due to the high cost of purchasing fuel. His loan should be successful, because his sales are based on customer orders. What he buys has a fast turnover, allowing his working capital to turn quickly and therefore increasing his profits. Choosing good customers would increase the recovery of his capital and thereby increase his earnings.

He is very comfortable in his job because they appreciate him for his punctuality, efficiency, and good manner with the others.\r\n\r\nHiginio is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help given he will be able to do the cleaning and plowing of his plot of land, where he wants to plant cotton and corn.  This way he will be able to increase his income, which will help him give his wife a better quality of life.  He also hopes to be able to study in the agronomy program soon, something he wants very much.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1110324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to clear and plow his plot of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T04:30:01Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Higinio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":76.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":92.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":92.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":99.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":116.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":119.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":122.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":128.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":131.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":136.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":143.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":147.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":154.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":159.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":165.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":174.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":179.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":186.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":433748,"name":"Jose Lenin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Lenin de 58 a\u00f1os de edad , tiene como actividad econ\u00f3mica  servicios funerarios y a la elaboraci\u00f3n de ata\u00fades, \u00e9l ya tiene varios a\u00f1os de experiencia en esta actividad y durante este tiempo ha llegado a conocer mucho sobre el manejo de su negocio.

Para el desempe\u00f1o en su negocio tiene una m\u00e1quina de dos latas para trillar ma\u00edz y una experiencia familiar que inici\u00f3 desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, con muy poco capital, pero con la ayuda de Dios y esfuerzos conjuntos de su familia, han logrado s\u00e1calo adelante y ser cada d\u00eda mas competitivos. Su meta principal es impulsar el crecimiento de su negocio, porque su clientela se incrementa, pero su capital de trabajo resulta insuficiente, para responderle, convirti\u00e9ndose esta situaci\u00f3n en su principal desaf\u00edo.

","en":"Yoanna has a business where she sells purina animal feed and grower, as well as heads of corn, threshing bran, hulled corn, cuchuco and cabecita, which are different characteristics of corn and have different uses in Colombian nutrition. Yoanna also sells sacks which give her an extra income which she counts on. In order to run her business she has a machine with two tins for threshing corn as well as family experience. She started four years ago with very little capital but with God's help and her joint family efforts they have managed to get their family ahead and become more competitive every day.\r\n\r\nHer main goal in is continue extending her business, because her client base is increasing but she does not have enough capital to respond to the demand, so this situation has become her main challenge. This is the reason why she has come to Cridkiva for her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use this loan to buy supplies (corn) in large quantities. Yoanna thinks this investment will be successful because she will always have products to offer to her growing number of customers. In the future she plans to buy a machine to obtain cuchuco (a food which consists of corn, barley or wheat grains peeled and chopped or semi ground, which are used to make soups in Columbia) and so she hopes to concentrate on strengthening her production and therefore her client base in order to finally fulfil a dream she shares with her husband; to see their two children grow up, today they are 4 and 9 years old, in conditions which boost their professional success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1109168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies (corn) in large quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yoanna Milena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":158533},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168765},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":172703},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":176733},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":180856},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":192410}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.82,"local_amount":158533,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":158872.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338884},{"amount":92.41,"local_amount":168765,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":169126.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395435},{"amount":94.58,"local_amount":172703,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":173073.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775224},{"amount":96.78,"local_amount":176733,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":177111.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387219},{"amount":99.04,"local_amount":180856,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":181243.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994059},{"amount":105.37,"local_amount":192410,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":192822.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130422}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T06:03:00Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":434476,"name":"Janelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janelyn is married and works hard to support her three children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJoane maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also sells snacks for additional income. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nJoane dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

For this reason, he continues to persevere and press forward in life.  Victor has always been a very enthusiastic and hardworking man.  He has held various jobs, one of them working as a miner in the city, which unfortunately led to him losing his vision in his left eye.  Four years ago, with the help of his family, Victor was able to proceed with establishing a small business selling food.  He has good clients who enjoy his delicious food, his charisma, and his friendly service.  \r\n<p>\r\nVictor is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the assistance they have provided, he will be able to buy a freezer that he needs for preserving perishable supplies, such as meat and vegetables that he uses in cooking.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is married to Gill, her business partner, and a mother to her child. By the grace of God, she has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilibeth operates a food stall and also delivers bread for additional income, her regular customers consisting of her neighbors and the local community.   In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is both family tradition and a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered wasteful to spend money on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.  Lilibeth earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Most of the people here cultivate corn. They chose their group name because where they meet there are a lot of capulines [a type of cherry]. They are a small group, but they take advantage of the opportunity to do big things like making cherry atole [a corn-based drink], cherry tamales, etc. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are all very busy women with a lot of commitments - the day we visited them they had a lot on their agenda including tending to their businesses, school meetings, etc.\r\n\r\nWe interviewed the friendly Maria de los Remedios, 51, who has been married to Alfredo for 34 years. Together they have 4 children who are already grown. They still support their daughter who is a single mother - Remedios takes care of their grandchild while her daughter works in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she makes aprons that are typical of the region, in traditional colors like pink, green, neon yellow, red, blue, etc. She says \"I learned from very young to make Nahua skirts that are typical of the region, as shown in the picture they are very full skirts and are therefore referred to as aprons. They are put on top of the skirts.\" she has been making the aprons for 25 years, starting when her husband bought her a sewing machine. She said that before, she didn't know how to make them but her mother-in-law did and didn't want to teach her. Remedios tried to make them herself, and with practice they started to turn out well and she has no trouble selling them because customers come on their own to her house to buy them.\r\n\r\nHer difficulty is that her sewing machine is broken, but if she has leftover money from the loan she will fix it. Even though she doesn't have a sewing machine right now, in the future she wants to fix up the room where she sews and make it into a seamstress workshop. She thinks that it's very difficult because fabric is expensive, but nevertheless she invests her earnings in fabric and is also able to save to make her dream a reality.\r\n\r\nRemedios and the rest of the group are very happy because they can invest in their businesses and improve their lives, and their families, with their profits. Filomena will buy an ox, while Maria Sabina, Josefina, Socorro, Esperanza and Angelica will buy sheep. Liliana will stock her grocery store and Viviana will buy party favors. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1108518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Remedios","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1218.75,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":17296.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419125},{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11531.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568704},{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11531.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399994},{"amount":406.25,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5765.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407650}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T22:54:22Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":434088,"name":"Jose Honorio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Desde Duran conocemos a Jos\u00e9 un carpintero de 47 a\u00f1os.

Twelve years ago, he decided to put his knowledge to work by opening up his own shop where he could work independently.  Carpentry is a family business, because his father was the one who taught him to work with wood and make final products such as beds, dressers, living room sets, and other items.  Now it's his turn, and he is working in his shop with his children.  His wife Flor has a business selling clothing.  Jose tells us that he enjoys the work that he does and he is well known for it.

His neighborhood has all the basic services but it does not have paved roads at the moment. Angel has a small motorcycle and bicycle repair shop, and he tells us that he has many clients because there are very few people who currently do this kind of work. He has learned how to be a mechanic from a young age by helping his father, who taught him not only how to repair but also about the kind of treatment that he should give to his clients. A little while ago he decided to find his own path as he was starting a family and he needed to improve his income. He tells us that now he works from Monday through Sunday, from 8 in the morning until 7 at night, and he is able to work these hours because the shop is located next to his home. Angel tells us that he hopes to not face any further competition in this sector because things are going well and he is generating enough income for his family. With this loan, he will buy parts and a pump to improve tire repairs. He also tells us that his wife Angela works in the sale of products by catalog, and by doing so she helps him with their income. They have three children who are 5, 4, and 2 years old, and who are students in public school.

He is married to Agripina, a housewife, and father to his children, who are all employed. With his wife and children, he manages their household while operating a processed meat business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nThe processed meat store is where one can buy processed and frozen meat like hot dogs, ham, and the like. Felix buys processed meat at wholesale prices and sells retail by the kilo. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. He will use the loan to buy additional processed and frozen meat products to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nFelix hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to college level.

On the one hand she offers beauty services and on the other she makes fruit juices for sale. She learned both activities three years ago and it was in 2010 that she started to use them to earn income.\r\n\r\nHer clientele are neighbors, friends, family members and people referred by current customers. The sale of natural juice takes place nearby her place of operation and she is able to monitor both businesses. She works as a stylist whenever her clientele requires it.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to become a professional stylist and to expand her profit margin investing to attract more customers but her working capital is her greatest challenge to reach this dream. This is the reason why she\u2019s requesting her Kiva loan, her first financing from Yehu Microfinance Trust, that she\u2019ll use to buy beauty supplies and modern equipment like a hair straightening iron and a hair dryer. She will also buy fruit to continue strengthening her two income-producing businesses she plans to use to improve her family\u2019s future.

They live in a house that she inherited from her parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nElva sells hardware goods from a store that is set up in her home, which prevents her from paying rent on a shop.  Her business is busy with activity and is stocked with various products.  She has been in this business for 10 years and her son helps with attending to the customers.  Elva enjoys her work because it generates an income that helps her partner with the household expenses and it also provides a distraction for her.  She enjoys having her own capital because it makes her feel independent.  What she dislikes is the fact that her business is located along a road that is not paved.  Therefore, the vehicles that drive by stir up dust that accumulates on her shelves, so she is left having to clean every day.  Elva is not discouraged and wants to continue and expand her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP organization.  She is pleased to have financial support for advancing her business.  For this reason, she promises to be punctual with her payments, just as she was with her previous loans.  Elva feels comfortable with her group because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  The loan amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy hardware goods in bulk.

Se dedica a esto hace m\u00e1s de 15 a\u00f1os, contando con la ayuda ocasional de peones, a quienes contrata por d\u00eda trabajado en labores de cultivo, siembra y cosecha. Considera su actividad muy rentable por las buenas ganancias que le deja. Y lo que le gusta es estar en el campo, en contacto con la naturaleza, oficio que aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres. Adem\u00e1s que con los ingresos econ\u00f3micos que tiene apoya a su esposo (que es obrero) a solventar los gastos de su hogar. Ahora se est\u00e1 recuperando de las p\u00e9rdidas que le dej\u00f3 la creciente del r\u00edo. Pero por otro, lado, se siente contenta, ya que logra vender toda lo que produce. Debido a su edad, solo tiene planes de mantenerse en esta actividad.\nEste es su pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 5 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Est\u00e1 agradecida por la l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito que tiene, por eso se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores. Adem\u00e1s de sentirse c\u00f3moda con el grupo del que forma parte, pues considera a sus miembros personas responsables y solidarias.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 2500 nuevos soles, invertir\u00e1 en la contrataci\u00f3n de ocho peones para la preparaci\u00f3n del terreno y siembra de ma\u00edz frejol, y posteriormente con ayuda de cuatro peones realizar\u00e1 la cosecha de su producci\u00f3n. ","en":"Elsa, age 64, is a hard-working, diligent, dynamic, and happy woman who likes the country.  She lives with her husband, Nicol\u00e1s, and her 20 year old daughter.  The house is hers as she inherited it from her parents.\r\n\r\nHer business activity is agriculture.  She grows corn, beans, bananas, and other fruit.  She has a field in a village on the banks of the river.  These three hectares were granted to her by the government.  She has been farming for over 15 years.  She has the occasional help of workers whom she hires for the day to do farm work like planting and harvesting.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business activity to be very profitable because of the good income it gives her.  She likes to be in the field and in contact with nature.  She learned farming from her parents.  Also, with the income she has she helps her husband (a worker) to pay for the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is now recovering from the losses that the rising river caused.  On the other hand, she is happy because she manages to sell all that she produces.  Due to her age, she only has plans to maintain this business activity.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  She is grateful for the loan, and she pledges to make her payments as she did with previous loans.  In addition to feeling comfortable with her communal bank, she considers the members to be responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,500 soles to hire eight day workers to prepare the land and to plant corn and beans.  Later, with the help of four people, she will harvest her production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1110658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire eight day workers to plant and harvest her next production of corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T16:00:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":363.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":397.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":408.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":425.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":444.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":460.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":134.46,"local_amount":363.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":363.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098994},{"amount":147.2,"local_amount":397.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":398.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401858},{"amount":151.14,"local_amount":408.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":408.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456136},{"amount":157.39,"local_amount":425.39,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":425.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451793},{"amount":164.36,"local_amount":444.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":444.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446975},{"amount":170.45,"local_amount":460.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":461.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052882}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T17:25:30Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":434096,"name":"Timotea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Timotea naci\u00f3 en el distrito de Coya de la provincia de Calca del departamento del Cusco pero actualmente ella vive en la comunidad de Huchuy Qosqo de la provincia de Calca. \n\nLa socia Timotea se sigue dedicando a la crianza de animales menores y ella tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes.

Now she has six machines that produce different finishes.  Anith considers her business to be profitable because of the good revenue that it generates.  She also enjoys working because she can have an income to cover her personal and household expenses.  Adith also likes to spend time doing something that she enjoys since it provides her with a distraction and makes her feel like a productive individual.  She has plans to expand the space in her workshop so that she will feel more comfortable and be able to display her finished garments.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 12th loan with the MFP organization, so she has had several years to become familiar with the loans.  Anith promises to be punctual with her payments, just as she was with her previous loans.  She gets along well with the other members of her Communal Bank since she has known them for a long time and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.

Her greatest wish is to have a well-equipped restaurant to develop her business more comfortably, because her greatest challenge to growing her business is the small space she has. \r\n\r\nHer shopping is done daily and her transportation expenses increase the cost of her products. For this reason she needs to buy in greater quantity and decrease the frequency of her shopping so she can qualify for volume discounts and be more competitive. This is why she has turned to Credit Kiva, her third loan with Yehu Microfinance Trust. With this loan she will buy supplies for the preparation of meals, bundles of wheat flour, sugar and maize flour.

Twelve years ago he ventured out on his own and opened his own workshop located in Duran.  He tells us that he enjoys working with wood, making changes to it, and altering its physical form to create useful objects like furniture for the home, doors, desks, and beds.  He tells us that he is in one of humanity\u2019s oldest industries in which we can find different tools and methods of working with wood in every culture and region.  Fortunato says that his current main competitor is aluminum, which is gaining much ground as a modern method.  One of his main difficulties is transportation, which generates costs both when he buys his supplies and when he delivers the finished products, but things are going well and he plans to continue this way.\r\n\r\nFortunato is presently separated and his two children live with their mother, who he supports financially.  He will use the money from this loan to buy tools with which to process the wood, hoping to develop the industry and provide employment, now that he currently has a helper.  Good luck Fortunato.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1110996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Duran (Primavera)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunato Candelario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1049.27,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.6,"local_amount":76.55,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":76.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287211481},{"amount":79.07,"local_amount":79.01,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294286797},{"amount":80.15,"local_amount":80.1,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":80.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340354},{"amount":81.98,"local_amount":81.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":81.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096727},{"amount":84.39,"local_amount":84.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331082},{"amount":85.78,"local_amount":85.72,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939725},{"amount":88.15,"local_amount":88.09,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":88.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072146},{"amount":89.74,"local_amount":89.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":89.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318506},{"amount":91.8,"local_amount":91.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":91.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013251},{"amount":94.94,"local_amount":94.87,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":94.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453616},{"amount":197.4,"local_amount":197.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":197.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459468}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T02:37:24Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:24:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

","en":"Aucileadora lives in the Fort\u00edn zone north of Guayaquil. Four years ago she was able to begin the construction of her home, which is made of cement and has electrical and water service. In Fort\u00edn, there are many services the residents do not have, such as sewer systems and paved streets. Aucileadora is 30 years old and is married to Segundo, who works as an operator at a gas station. They have two children who attend a state school. She has a grocery store located in her home where she provides her customers with rice and sugar that she sells by the pound, groceries, cleaning supplies, meat, chicken, etc. She opened the business with the help of her husband since she was a housewife but wanted to contribute to the household finances. She has had the business for a year, and it is going very well for her, since she has many customers. She opens the store from 8 in the morning to 10 at night and tends it herself. She likes her business a lot because she can have the necessary time to raise her children and help them with their homework. With the loan she will buy merchandise to have in stock. Aucileadora tells us that her dream is to open a branch with which she will have more sales and improve her economic situation."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1111056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, and foodstuffs for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Fortin)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aucileadora Genara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":851.72,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":76.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":434129,"name":"Jorge","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge de 63 a\u00f1os vende jugos en una zona muy concurrida de Libertad.

And since Zahiya noticed that their income does not satisfy their needs, she decided to launch her clothing business from her home with the small amount of money she already had. \r\n\r\nZahiya sells a wide variety of women's and kids' clothes from which she earns a fair amount of money daily. To better develop her work, she\u2019s requesting a youth loan from Kiva Partner Ameen s.a.l. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more merchandise for her business, such as pants, T-shirts and many other items. This will allow her to offer a greater variety of products and thus improve her income. Zahiya wishes to get married very soon and have her own clothing shop.

","en":"The communal bank VILLA MERCEDEZ is composed of 10 members, 8 women and 2 men. The president of the bank is Shirley, 34 years old, who with her partner has two children - 2 and 3 years of age. She has worked in the sale of meat for many years, and this loan is her first with this institution. Shirley will use this loan for the purchase of meat, and in this way increase her working capital. The reason she is asking for this loan is a lack of working capital. Shirley faces challenges in her business including competition - as there are many people who sell meat in the area where she sells - however she has many clients because of the good treatment she gives them and because she is a very friendly person. She is going to use the benefits of this loan to continue improving her business, and she wishes to be able to have a store in the market near where she lives in the longer term. Shirley is a very hardworking person and she is happy for the opportunity provided to her and her group mates, especially since in some cases they are the sole providers for their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1111216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

Esmilda dedicates herself to the sale of clothing and perfumes, and started the business thanks to her husband who gave her $200 as capital to start it. 5 years have passed since she began selling only on credit. Currently she sells jewelry, unisex clothing, pants and perfumes on a credit and cash basis. She does her work alone in the afternoons, and goes about her area visiting her clients. Some also call her and arrange visits in their free time, and in this way she has additionally benefited. Esmilda tells us that her biggest problem is delinquincy as she arrives home late. If she obtains this loan, she will buy merchandise to have in stock, which she does because many times there are special offers or promotions that she should take advantage of to obtain greater earnings.
