She lives in the city of Manta where she has her cement house with basic services. She is separated but is in charge of her two children who study in public school. Amparo tells us that the business was started by her parents, who taught her how to collect and treat her product. She explains to us that the hard and white seed, almost like ivory, is obtained from the seeds of the Phytelephas palm. The polished endosperm of the seed looks much like ivory, despite having completely distinct properties. In Ecuador, the species used for obtaining the tagua seed is phitelephas aequatorialis, which exists in the subtropical region between the Andes and the coast especially in the province of Manabi. Additionally, the tagua seeds can be processed like flour which can then be used to feed animals like cows, pigs and birds. It is estimated that in 1920, some 20% of buttons produced in the United States were made of tagua, principally from Ecuador, Colombia and Panama. Currently, it is mostly used to make buttons and decorative animal figures which are highly sought after by tourists. Her children help her to collect and sell in their spare time, and she is very grateful for their help as it can become quite heavy to transport these products. She will invest this loan in the purchase of utensils which can be used during the polishing process. In the coming years she would like to buy a vehicle to improve transportation for her

Her husband Jose is an independent fisherman.

She began to sell this way because her husband was not earning much money fishing and she needed to cover her family's expenses, especially those of her children. Yoly works alone, going door-to-door in the area where she lives visiting potential clients. She brings with her a suitcase full of her products with the price marked on each one. For example: perfumes for $17.95, deoderants for %7.61, creams for $22.22 and similarly for other products. The products from the catalogs already have the price printed. Yoly tells us that the sale of her products gives her a 20% profit. She mentions that what she needs now is capital to be able to buy her merchandise, principally when there is a promotion and it is for sale since she can then generate greater profitability.

She has a cement house which is located in one of the few areas that have public services such as water, light, a sewage system, and paved roads. She currently does not have any children living at home as they are all older and independent. Martha works selling jewelry and cosmetics door-to-door. She began selling six years ago in order to cover the medical expenses of her diabetic mother who had lost a leg. Now she likes her job a lot, and enjoys conversing with her clients, offering her products, and taking beauty courses so she can better inform her clients of the benefits of the products that she sells. She tells us that the key to success in this business is to know what she is offering. As she is single she likes to travel to other cities, such as Babahoyo for example, to visit some clients, which she does in the company of a friend and only on the weekends. She hopes that in the future, wiht this loan, she will be able to increase her earnings and be able to open a fixed location and work from her home.

Empez\u00f3 este negocio hace 4 a\u00f1os con una peque\u00f1a m\u00e1quina de coser con la cual hacia sabanas, edredones, fundas de almohadas, cobertores. Tambi\u00e9n realiza sabanas tejidas pero estas son m\u00e1s laboriosas y demandan m\u00e1s tiempo por lo que su costo es m\u00e1s elevado. A pesar de esto Cecilia nos comenta que son este tipo de sabanas las que m\u00e1s gustan. Se siente muy satisfecha con sus logros adem\u00e1s nos indica que su hija tambi\u00e9n le ayuda en la confecci\u00f3n. Con el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita piensa comprar lana, agujas e hilos. Su meta pr\u00f3xima es tener su propio taller de artesan\u00eda donde tenga personas que le ayuden con la confecci\u00f3n.","en":"Cecilia lives in the Northern sector of Guayaquil known as Fort\u00edn. She is 45 years old and lives with her family in their own home. Her husband Washington has been working as an independent brick layer teacher for 22 years.  She has a daughter in public school. Cecilia makes and sells blankets for the home. She started this business 4 years ago with a small sewing machine. She made blankets, comforters, pillow cases, and duvet covers. She also knits blankets but these are harder to make and require more time to make so they have a higher price. However, they are what sell most. She is very satisfied with her success and tells us her daughter also helps her with knitting. She will use the loan to buy wool, needles, and thread. Her next goal is to own her own sewing workshop with workers to help her produce

He is a very hardworking and enthusiastic man who wants to continue to exert himself in order to get ahead with his family.  Ever since he was very young, he needed to work to pay for his expenses.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, he was not able to enroll in a university, but he would have liked to have been able to study accounting.  In his spare time, Arturo likes to take a walk through the hot streets of the city with his family, and at times after his walk he enjoys eating the dish of \"arroz con pato\" (duck with rice). \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and thanks to the support of his wife, Arturo works as a driver with his own mototaxi.  He works about 10 hours a day, during which time he can serve about 45 customers.  He believes that his business is going well because of the friendly and respectful service he provides to his customers.\r\n\r\nArturo is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they are providing he will be able to make some repairs and improvements that his mototaxi needs.  These are: replacing the canopy, steering wheel, and sprocket wheel, overhauling the engine and painting the vehicle.  In this way, Arturo will be able to rely on a mototaxi that is in good condition, and he can increase his customer base and his income.  With this income, he wants to be able to do some finishing work on his house, and in the not too far future he hopes to be able to acquire an automobile so that he can continue to work and provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1111277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair and renovate his mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-07T23:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-07T23:50:13Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo Martin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":97.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":106.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":110.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":89.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222541},{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":94.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":95.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298626},{"amount":36.59,"local_amount":97.58,"processed_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":99.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351357},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":103.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108995},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":106.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":107.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345178},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":110.31,"processed_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954391}],"funded_date":"2012-06-08T02:09:57Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":434849,"name":"Consolacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For more than 14 years in Migpange, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental, Consolacion, a 49-year-old married mother of three children, has made a living through the operation of a general store.

She tells us that his production is very good and that currently they are already gathering the harvest.  This is exactly why they need the loan, to pay for labor, because if they sold the crop right now they would have to sell it very cheap, and the wholesale merchants would be the ones to get the profits.  This is why, upon getting the loan, they can wait a little and get better profits from the hard field work.  They plant every season of the year because they have water-pumping equipment.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to pay for labor.

She lives in the Isla Trinitaria suburb of Guayaquil, which is one the the few that has all of the basic services.  The house where she lives is owned by her parents, as is her business premises.  Since she was young she has lived in the business world, starting with her parents who had a pharmacy.  For unknown reasons her parents liquidated the business and thus she proposed opening her own business.  Mercy has a diaper store located in her parents' former business premises.  She decided on this business as she had knowledge of the products after having worked in this type of business.  She is very happy because with this business she can pay for her university studies.  She works every day from 7 in the morning until 10 at night.  In her store she sells diapers at 12 for $1.25, stewed fruit for $1.00, diapers at 48 for $12.40, and also baby clothes, toys, baby bottles and other things.  Between laughs she tells us that it is going well because a baby is born every day and so her business never declines.

Maludajan plans to invest the income from the loan in further growing her farm.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1110212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase purebred sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ala-Buka village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T10:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T10:00:10Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maludajan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":535.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":434762,"name":"Raquel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Raquel de 36 a\u00f1os de edad es originaria de un pueblo llamado Santa Catarina Mechocan.

Today she is applying for her first crediKiva because she wants to improve the infrastructure of her businesses and add heating cabinets, microwaves, buy ice cream, refreshments and sweets in general so that her customers find an atmosphere that is more comfortable, well-equipped and they feel at ease, entering her establishment and buying everything their taste desires because Judith sells delicious food that impacts her customers' liking and this is exactly what creates the success of crediKiva.\r\n\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1109003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy heating cabinets, microwaves, ice cream, refreshments, and sweets, in general.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80049},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84553},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86526},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88545},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90611},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":92725},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":94889},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97103},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99369},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101687},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104060},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.27,"local_amount":80049,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":81023.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338873},{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":84553,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85581.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395423},{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":86526,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":87578.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775217},{"amount":48.97,"local_amount":88545,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":89622.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387207},{"amount":96.93,"local_amount":175256,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":177388.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130414},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":96046,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97214.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519292},{"amount":287.08,"local_amount":519025,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":525340.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071125}],"funded_date":"2012-07-05T00:35:08Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":434955,"name":"Sam Ath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sam Ath (in the photo) has full-time employment in a hotel.

En su negocio,  Ang\u00e9lica tiene como sus principales clientes, a conductores de buses intermunicipales, los cuales promueven las delicias de la deliciosa comida que ella prepara en su restaurante y que combina con refrescos y helados, pues desde muy ni\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 este oficio, debido a que su madre tenia una caseta tur\u00edstica en el balneario de Prado Mar, ubicado a 5 minutos de Puerto Colombia, donde preparaban toda clase de platos marinos.

","en":"Ang\u00e9lica who is 41 years old lives on the Caribbean sea shore in the town of Puerto Colombia where the beach, breeze and sea are conditions for tourism in the cities and towns close by, whose families visit especially on weekends, holidays and their vacations to delight in this atmosphere of great physical and spiritual rest. Angelica has a restaurant in a well located and potentially growing area where there are sporting and educational settings nearby, in a very high place where you can see the old town maritime dock, which hints at the success of her investments. In her business, Angelica's main customers are intermunicipal bus drivers who promote the delicious food that she prepares in her restaurant and that she combines with refreshments and ice cream. Since she was a little girl, she learned this job since her mother had a little tourist house in the health resort of Prado Mar, located 5 minutes from Puerto Colombia where they prepared all types of seafood dishes. All of her family supports Angelica's restaurant, alternating continuously among household and productive chores, such as attending to customers, and in the case of her two children who are 13 and 15, they prioritize their studies and thus their academic performance. Angelica and her partner feel very happy with their restaurant since, with the fruit of their work in family unity, they have managed to build their own house and this gives meaning to their lives to continue harboring in their minds the dream to support their children and see them in the future become successful professionals.

Fishing has become a tourist attraction and a mode of subsistence for the people who live in the environs of the islands of Granada as is the case of don Julio, a humble fisherman of 58 years old, originally from Diriomo, who navigates between the beautiful islands that Granada has.  He goes out everyday to fish.  His boat and his two paddles are the means of labor of don Julio.  He began his activity with a workshop for small wood industry making boats.  Later he had the opportunity to start fishing.  He saw that the work was enjoyable and generated more revenue.  He sells products to his customers by the pound.\r\n\r\nHis wife helps with the income that she gets from the sale of food and drink that she has in their house.  He sells his products in the same area and in the surrounding areas of the community and also has steady customers.

Al principio se le hizo dif\u00edcil ya que ten\u00eda que promocionar para crear su cartera de clientes. Hace 5 a\u00f1os que inicio el negocio y ahora le va muy bien trabajando todos los d\u00edas desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la 1 de la tarde ya que tiene otro trabajo. Como es madre soltera tiene 2 trabajos y gracias a eso y al esfuerzo de su trabajo ha salido adelante hasta la fecha.  Paola nos comenta que una de sus dificultades es la ubicaci\u00f3n ya que quisiera poder ubicarlo en la parte exterior de su casa, abriendo un local amplio donde pueda exhibir las manualidades que realiza. Con el cr\u00e9dito comprara material para la confecci\u00f3n como fomix, telas, lanas, hilos y dem\u00e1s. Espera continuar trabajando para seguir apoyando a su hijo y que siga adelante en la profesi\u00f3n que elija.","en":"Paola, 37, lives on the outskirts of Guayaquil.  She and her son live in a house that she owns.  Her husband died 4 years ago.  Her 18-year old son just started military service.  Paola earns her living making and selling party supplies.  She operates the business from her house.  She says that she stumbled into the business, by which she means that she started it after making cut-outs and playing around with them.  She liked the results and realized that she could make a business selling them.  It was hard at first because she had to find customers.  That was 5 years ago and now she has a steady stream of customers.  She works from 9:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the afternoon when she leaves for her other job.  She needs 2 jobs because that's what it takes when you're a single mother with a growing boy.  Paola says that she would like to set up a larger space in her house where she can sell her products.  She will use this loan to buy the supplies she needs--cloth, threads, etc.--to operate her business.  She hopes to continue working so that she can help her son pursue whatever career he chooses."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1112064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials for her party supply business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T13:40:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1049.27,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":74.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":85.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":94.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":95.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":104.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":434777,"name":"Graciela Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Graciela tiene 45 a\u00f1os viviendo en Playas, el sector donde tiene su casa es uno de los pocos que cuentan con los servicios b\u00e1sicos y pavimentaci\u00f3n, agradece a las autoridades de que poco a poco est\u00e9n mejorando la ciudad que es un lugar muy tur\u00edstico.

She then realized that she could expand the business by stocking school supplies.  She didn't have a lot of money to invest in inventory, though, so she approached us for her first loan.  In addition to selling school supplies, she now has a general store and tells us that she is happy with her progress.  She works every day, from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night, and still finds time to take care of her family.  She sells school supplies and groceries--rice, sugar, cooking oil, cleaning products, toiletries and other household supplies--that she buys with the money she borrows.  Her plan is to set up a shop large enough for both businesses because they are separate now and the general store is not easy to reach from the street.  She wants to grow the business so that she can help her children in every way that she can.

He works from 5 in the morning until 9.\r\n\r\nWilson tells us that, incredibly, in this century there are pirates who rob the catch and the motors from the boats, creating considerable losses.  He hopes not to have this problem in the coming years.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will buy nets by the meter, gasoline, and a motor to be able to use for parts.  With this he hopes to improve his machines and increase his production, because his family depends on him.\r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to be able to finish the second story of his house so his children will be more comfortable.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1112079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

He learned this trade 10 years ago, working for a friend and he really enjoyed it. So, from this experience, he realized that he really liked this profession and has been doing it from that day until now. He is independent and has lots of clients. He repairs televisions, DVD players, stereos, etc. He works from 8 am to 6pm. He has no help as he can\u2019t afford to pay someone a dignified wage for their services.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, she was not able to study to become a secretary, which she would have liked to have done.  But her dream is to be able to do this someday.  In her spare time, she enjoys playing volleyball with her friends and neighbors, and at times she enjoys cooking the delicious \"arroz con pato\" (rice with duck) to pamper her partner.\r\n\r\nThanks to her enterprising spirit and the support of her husband, Maria started up a small ceviche restaurant more than 3 years ago, where she sells ceviche and chilcano (a cocktail made with the Peruvian brandy called Pisco).  She and her husband get up very early to make all of the preparations and get ready to serve their customers.  She works in the business for about 7 hours a day, during which time she is able to serve about 50 customers.  Maria believes that her business is doing well because her business is well-known and is recommended by her customers because of the tasty food and friendly service.\r\n\r\nMaria is grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help that they are providing she will be able to purchase tables, chairs and a canopy, in this way better equipping her business so that she will be able to tend to a greater number of customers and increase her income.

Olga decided to focus on selling  farm supplies: seeds, chemicals, plastic film for hothouses, etc.. Olga\u2019s husband helps her in this business in every way. She and her husband have three sales points: one in Znamenka and two and Kamenka. Olga has been in this business for 11 years already. Her monthly sales volume from one sales point is presently around 70,000 UAH.\r\n\r\nOlga has turned to Kiva for a loan in the amount of 20,000 in the hope to invest these funds into stocking up on agricultural supplies, such as seeds and fertilizers, for later resale. Buying seasonal supplies will allow Olga to increase her sales volume and earn an additional income, allowing her to continue growing her business. Olga does not want to stop there, and plans in the future to expand her business and sell agricultural machinery, mini-tractors etc.\r\nNote: this case description is in Russian.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1111120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to stock up on farm  supplies, particularly seeds and fertilizers, for later resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":412.46,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518768},{"amount":412.46,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-28T08:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594702},{"amount":412.46,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301428199},{"amount":412.46,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308188467},{"amount":412.45,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419569},{"amount":412.71,"local_amount":3335,"processed_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3335.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323024666}],"funded_date":"2012-06-10T15:57:35Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T14:25:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":434788,"name":"71-Las Preciosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento 71- Las Preciosas est\u00e1  compuesto por nueve integrantes ocho mujeres y un var\u00f3n la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

To improve his business, Namiq is requesting a loan for 1,000 AZN to buy garden tools, fertilizers and seeds. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1112490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy garden tools, fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agjabadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T16:30:18Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namiq","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":211,"local_amount":165.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-27T07:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":165.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278756},{"amount":86.23,"local_amount":67.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331618},{"amount":106.79,"local_amount":83.76,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308088578},{"amount":233.45,"local_amount":183.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322931596},{"amount":79.61,"local_amount":62.44,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":62.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331064439},{"amount":150.95,"local_amount":118.39,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":118.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339453225},{"amount":106.32,"local_amount":83.39,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347006232},{"amount":88.11,"local_amount":69.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":69.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355748705},{"amount":212.54,"local_amount":166.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":166.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364453031}],"funded_date":"2012-07-01T18:01:30Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:10:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":435015,"name":"Leonila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonila is 51 years old and lives in Mantic Tangub City with her husband and three children.

Ligia lives in Granada, she is 48 years old, and has dedicated two and a half years to her general store.  She is married and the mother of three children who live on their own.  She attended school up to the primary level but her economic situation prevented her from continuing.  However, this did not stop Ligia from striving to get ahead.  Now she has her own business but she did not settle for this; she also sells meals.  She began this activity selling fruit drinks and small quantities of food.  Then over time she was getting customers who were satisfied with the dishes she prepared.  She took the profits and invested in her general store to make it more sustainable.  Her children help her in the business and she sells her products from her home.\r\n\r\nShe rises very early to get her business going.  Her husband helps her with the household expenses working as a tailor and tending a farm located near their community.  Ligia is requesting the loan to purchase staples such as rice, beans, sugar, juice, soda, ham, coffee, meat, and vegetables.

Su meta es organizarlo mejor, para brindar un ambiente confortable a su clientela; as\u00ed mismo quiere aumentar sus inventarios para estabilizar un poco el incremento de los precios de los insumos, comprando por volumen y de contado, pero su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para lograrlo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres, como aceite, arroz, carnes, huevos y legumbres, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n utensilios de cocina, sillas y mesas,  con el fin de aumentar sus posibilidades de acceso a nuevos clientes. Su inversi\u00f3n de credikiva ser\u00e1 exitosa, porque ganar\u00e1 el descuento de los art\u00edculos en doble v\u00eda, por su compra en vol\u00famenes y porque no se somete en el periodo, al constante aumento de precios; adem\u00e1s porque brindarle un ambiente confortable y bien presentado a sus clientes  potencializa el aumento del n\u00famero de ellos, lo que en resumes es el objetivo  de Hersilia. ","en":"Hersilia is a 64-year-old woman who has been employed in a restaurant for 25 years. However, being an independent and free spirit, she decided to start her own activity, and she therefore put all of her experience in opening her own restaurant in order to independently make a living. For this activity she had to face many challenges, notably her old age and the loss of her eldest son who died in an accident, but she succeeded in saving some money she used to buy and sell various products, even thought she lost these products because she was robbed. Knowing this, a good neighbor of hers helped her by lending her a small amount of money and by initially managing the set up of her activity in a park by selling soups, while Hersilia was contracting the necessary licenses to work there. Thanks to this activity, that has grown little by little until becoming a restaurant, she succeeded in paying for the education of her 5 children, aged between 31 and 38. Her goal is to better organize her restaurant, in order to offer a comfortable environment to her customers; she also wants to increase her inventory to stabilize a little the rise in the price of the ingredients, by buying in larger volumes and paying cash, but she does not have enough working capital. This is the reason why she is asking for a loan; this is the first loan she requests to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it to buy provisions such as oil, rice, meat, eggs and pulses, as well as cooking tools, chairs and tables in order to give access to more customers. Her investment in this loan will be successful because she will gain a discount in two ways: by buying in larger volumes on one side and by not giving way to the constant rise in prices on the other; on top of this, by offering a comfortable and pleasant environment to her customers she will capitalize on the increase in the number of customers, which in the end is Hersilia\u2019s objective."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1109067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy provisions such as oil, rice, meat, and eggs, as well as cooking tools, chairs and tables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T17:00:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hersilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71617},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74844},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76590},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78377},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80206},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82077},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83993},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85952},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87958},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90010},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92111},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96265}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.39,"local_amount":71617,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":72082.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338881},{"amount":41.16,"local_amount":74844,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75330.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395433},{"amount":42.13,"local_amount":76590,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77087.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775222},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":78377,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78886.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387217},{"amount":44.11,"local_amount":80206,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":80727.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994058},{"amount":45.14,"local_amount":82077,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":82610.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130421},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":83993,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84538.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519298},{"amount":92.93,"local_amount":168958,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":170056.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527195},{"amount":92.89,"local_amount":168897,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":169994.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927977},{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":114441,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":115184.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817588}],"funded_date":"2012-06-15T21:05:13Z","paid_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":435030,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is not taking care of any additional family members.\r\n\r\nShe has been operating an eating place at her home for the last three years and working seven days a week. She has no other source of income.\r\n\r\nDeborah has requested a loan of 200,000 Uganda shillings (UGX) from MCDT- SACCO to enable her to buy ingredients in bulk and replace utensils that have worn out. Her challenges include seasonality supply of food and associated high prices.

Among the possible explanations for this are some that say it derives from a comment made by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds like \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", meaning \"Talca resembles London\"). Indeed, in the winter, an abundant fog often blankets the city, as happens in the capital of the United

This city has a lot of stunning flora and fauna.  The people here work in farming, livestock raising and textiles.  It is a very beautiful place where we are able to separate ourselves from everyday life and enjoy the landscape and amazing nature.  Leonardo lives together with his wife.  The couple have four children who are 7, 11, 13 and 15 years old.  Leonardo loves them very much indeed and works hard in order to provide for them and ensure they become upstanding citizens.  Whenever he has any free time, Leonardo goes out for walks with his family.  He also occasionally likes to eat one of his favorite meals: delicious fried fish.  Leonardo managed to complete a degree and become an elementary school teacher.  He really enjoys this career because he has a lot of patience for teaching.  \r\n\r\nLeonardo also works every day in his business making and selling paintings.  In addition to this, he provides an accommodation service to tourists who come to his city, and has a small, traditional, music orchestra.  Leonardo is, as we say in our country, a 'mil oficios' (Jack of all trades) because he does all kinds of jobs, as long as they are honest.  He is very active and charming and believes that he is doing well in his business as a result of this kindness and charisma, and because he puts a lot of effort into his work so that he can get ahead in life.  He needs to work in all his different business activities in order to provide for his household.\r\n\r\nLeonardo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to buy beds, mattresses, sheets and mosquito nets.  He will also be able to make repairs to some of the rooms that he provides to tourists.  The tourist season is approaching and he would like to be able to provide a better service and greater comfort to the tourists who stay with him.  This will enable him to improve his income and his customers will recommend his business.

She breeds cattle and sells milk and milk products as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Rubaba has eight years of experience in this field, thanks to her father who taught her the best way to look after cattle. \r\nRubaba usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in 5-6 months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar. She also sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Selling milk and meat brings an income of AZN 230 per month. Milk, yoghurt, and beef are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth with meat or vegetables) and dolma (stuffed vegetables), and people always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \r\nRubaba wishes to save money to buy herself a good dowry, hence when she gets married she can buy worthy stuff in her new house. Rubaba applied for AZN 1,000 to purchase fodder and two cows (one to raise and sell and one for milk). This will be her second loan, and she has a very positive loan history. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1112568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fodder and two cows (one to raise and sell and one for milk)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Saatli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.833333 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-06-08T21:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-08T21:40:09Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.2,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":88.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286800076},{"amount":92.62,"local_amount":72.64,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-27T07:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":72.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278757},{"amount":102.8,"local_amount":80.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331619},{"amount":106.86,"local_amount":83.81,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308088579},{"amount":90.09,"local_amount":70.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315322849},{"amount":132.9,"local_amount":104.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":104.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322931597},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331064440},{"amount":94.61,"local_amount":74.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339453226},{"amount":117.88,"local_amount":92.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":92.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347006233},{"amount":94.32,"local_amount":73.98,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":74.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355748706},{"amount":224.47,"local_amount":176.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":176.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372857315}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T11:51:18Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:07:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":435279,"name":"Nidia Graciela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.
