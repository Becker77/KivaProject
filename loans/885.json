It was a great idea because he does not have any competition in the area and it is going well for him.  He is open from eight in the morning until ten at night.  He also helps himself out financially by working as an informal taxi.  He does this in the afternoons by paying for a car and giving rides to people he knows.  Carlos says that he only gives rides to people who call him on the phone, which he tells us is safer for both him and the person he is driving.  His greatest problem, since he is the one who provides for his household, is that, at his age, he gets sick and has to stop working.  He will buy dried fruit to sell with this loan.

Celia vende cecina en las calles de su comunidad y solicit\u00f3 su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar carne y preparar la cecina. Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio hace 10 a\u00f1os, su esposo prepara la cecina y ella sale a vender. Esta actividad econ\u00f3mica es muy importante para Celia porque es de gran ayuda para cubrir los gastos de la escuela de sus hijos y para comprar los alimentos b\u00e1sicos para su hogar. Ella se siente orgullosa de tener su propio negocio, aun m\u00e1s porque ha ido mejorando con el tiempo. Como mujer emprendedora, enfrenta los desaf\u00edos de costos elevados en la carne y la competencia de otros establecimientos. Sus sue\u00f1os y esperanzas son que su negocio crezca y que sus hijos vivan mejor, con menos carencias. \n\nLas integrantes del grupo (Elena, Monica, Celia y Ana Lilia) quieren enviar a Kiva y a Vision Fund el siguiente mensaje \"Gracias por sus pr\u00e9stamos, es una ayuda que nos dan y se preocupan por ayudarnos a crecer los negocios\".","en":"The members of this group are continuing in the activities that they were involved in when they received their last loan.  Celia is 33 years old, is married and has 2 children: a girl in primary school and a boy in high school.  Celia sells <em>cecina<\/em> (dried, salted beef) in the streets of her community and is seeking a loan in order to buy beef so that she can prepare the <em>cecina<\/em>.  She started her business 10 years ago.  Her husband prepares the <em>cecina<\/em>, and she goes out and sells it.  \r\n\r\nThis economic activity is very important for Celia because it plays a large role in helping to cover her children's school expenses and her basic household needs.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"Patricia Mar\u00eda belongs to the \u201cUnidos lo Lograremos\u201d communal bank, whose members live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nShe works as a seamstress, specifically she sews curtains and sportswear, and does general mending. She has been running her business for two years, and works from home. Patricia performs her sewing work from Monday to Saturday, and manages her work hours according to her availabilty.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago at distributors, as they are places where she finds her merchandise at low cost, so it is advantageous from a financial point of view. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy fabric for making sportswear, and thread, zippers and buttons for the mending her customers need.\r\n\r\nOne of Patricia's goals is to grow as an entrepeneur and to continue with her business in order to generate greater income, and this way go for a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nPatricia lives with her two children and her 13-year-old granddaughter who is in school.

It constitutes the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, as it is the most important city in the Chilean central valley.\r\n\r\nTalca is the subject of a curious phrase in Chile: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (\"Talca, Paris, and London\"). Among the possible explanations for this are some that say it derives from a comment made by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds like \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", meaning \"Talca resembles London\").

One of the members of this group is Hortensia, who is 59 years old and is better known as Dona Tencha, and who has worked selling plants and flower pots for eight years. Dona Tencha says that what she likes best about her business is watering her plants and maintaining them well so that they can develop and above all fertilizing them so that they will not have pests.  She says that she started her business by buying rosebushes first, and then with her earnings she bought more plants including anthuriums, gardenias, bromeliads and others.  One of the things that is difficult in her business is fumigation, because it is a chemical product and fumigation must be done carefully so as not to damage the plant or breathe in the product which is unhealthy.  She says that the most beautiful experience that she has in her work is when she goes to buy new plants, because she gets to know new places and more varieties of plants.  She normally travels to the cities of Michoacan, Cuernavaca and Cuatla in other states within the country, but the plants that she likes best are those that she buys in Cuernavaca, Morelos, as they are the most cheerful and brilliant.

She sells what she produces in the community where buyers come looking for her rice crop.  This represents a great effort, of which she is very proud because few women do this work to generate income for their homes.  Her main inspiration are her children, for whom she fights to take good care of them.  The rainy season is getting close, so she wants to harvest before it begins.  She is requesting the Kiva loan to buy supplies and to pay for labor to harvest 1.5 \"manzanas\" [2.5 acres] of rice.  This loan will help her have better production and to harvest her crop and sell it in time so she can try to plant more next season.  Her future plans are to buy 2 \"manzanas\" [3.5 acres] of land since she currently only has 1.5 \"manzanas\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1113725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and to pay for labor to harvest 1.5 \"manzanas\" [2.5 acres] of rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T04:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T04:00:54Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora Del Socorro \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":598.27,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":299.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":299.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300.01,"local_amount":299.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":300.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005951},{"amount":299.99,"local_amount":299.13,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":299.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118737}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T14:59:50Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:30:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":435743,"name":"Rosa Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa Genoveva tiene su negocio que el destace de cerdo y res, Ella aduce que en su negocio siempre vende diario, y gracias a esto su nivel de vida ha mejorado pero siempre est\u00e1 buscando la forma de mejorar sus ingresos.

Hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os, trabaj\u00f3 como cocinero en un restaurante del municipio, donde perfeccion\u00f3 sus conocimientos y sus habilidades que lo llevaron a considerar abrir su propio negocio e independizarse. Fue as\u00ed como cre\u00f3 el Restaurante \u201cDonde Edwin\u201d, utilizando inicialmente los utensilios de cocina de su madre ya que contaba con pocos recursos pero poco a poco fue comprando sus ollas, calderos y dem\u00e1s enseres para la producci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de ir adquiriendo una clientela que ha ido creciendo a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os. A algunos de sus clientes les ofrece cr\u00e9ditos quincenales para el pago de la comida, es por esto que necesita tener un capital de trabajo disponible que le permita comprar los insumos al por mayor para obtener descuentos y as\u00ed poder seguir atendiendo su demanda.  A pesar de que Edwin tiene competencia muy cerca, esto no representa amenaza para el ya que su \u00e9xito lo atribuye a su saz\u00f3n casera en los platos, donde utiliza principalmente muchas verduras frescas.  La especialidad de la casa es el pescado frito acompa\u00f1ado de arroz con coco, patacones, ensalada de aguacate y agua de panela, plato t\u00edpico de la regi\u00f3n costera donde se encuentra ubicado, muy cerca del mar.  Est\u00e1 aspirando a su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, siente que ha sido de gran utilidad para su negocio por ser una buena fuente de recursos.  Su mayor sue\u00f1o es trasladar alg\u00fan d\u00eda el restaurante a un local para independizarlo de la vivienda y as\u00ed brindarle mayor comodidad a su clientela y a su familia.","en":"From a tender age, Edwin learned the art of cooking having been brought up by his grandmother who had a restaurant for a long time, and who he always helped with it. Roughly 10 years ago, he worked as a chef at a restaurant in the municipality where he honed his knowledge and abilities which led him to consider opening his own business and to become independent.\r\n\r\nThat was how he came about setting up the restaurant \u201cDonde Edwin\u201d, initially he used his mother's cooking utensils as he had little resources but little by little he bought his pots, cookers and other equipment for production, moreover, he acquires a customer base which has been growing over the years. He gives some of his customers a layaway plan (payments every two weeks) to pay for the meals that is why he needs an available working capital which enables him to buy the suppliers in bulk to obtain discounts and in that way continue to meet the demand. Despite the fact that Edwin has competition nearby, this does not represent a threat for him as he attributes his success to the homely taste in his dishes, where he uses mainly a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. The house specialty is fried fish accompanied by coconut rice, avocado salad and agua de panela [sugarcane water], typical dish in the coastal region in which it is located, very close to the sea. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking his second loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He feels that it has been extremely useful for his business as an excellent source of income. His great dream is to one day move the restaurant to premises to separate it from the home and make his customers and his family more comfortable.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1113758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy the supplies and food in bulk to produce the dishes that he sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T08:00:14Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":91667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":92187.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338888},{"amount":23.94,"local_amount":42142,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":42381.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387223},{"amount":548.98,"local_amount":966191,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":971680.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071137}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T05:46:17Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":435752,"name":"Walter Oswaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Walter, es un agricultor, tiene 20 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres, est\u00e1 soltero, \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 a los 15 a\u00f1os el trabajo agr\u00edcola junto con su padre desde hace cinco a\u00f1os est\u00e1 dedicado por completo, con el objetivo de obtener ingresos para apoyar a su familia y para cubrirse su propia necesidad.\n\u00c9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo porque est\u00e1 iniciando la siembra de Chile para esto deber\u00e1 comprarse 1000 plantas, abonos, foliares, que son necesarios para aplicarlos al cultivo ayud\u00e1ndole mejorar y a fortalecer la plantaci\u00f3n.\nEl objetivo de Walter es aumentar su nivel econ\u00f3mico a trav\u00e9s de una buena cosecha, para tener una mejor condici\u00f3n y apoyar a sus padres en las necesidades b\u00e1sicas.\n","en":"Walter is a farmer, he is 20 years old, single and lives with his parents.

She requests her first Kiva loan to buy a larger volume of merchandise as sometimes while she is awaiting payment, orders are placed that she cannot fulfill due to a lack of capital. \r\n\r\nFor the last 12 years, she has been living with her long-term partner, who runs a family recycling business, and their two children between the ages of 1 to 4 years of age. They are a very close-knit family and they work together, an example of which has been all the support which they have shown in the face of the difficult situation of overcoming her mother-in-law's

He has worked with repairing and selling computers and household appliances for seven years. Andrei chose this specific type of goods as he knows household appliances well and understands computer technology well. By profession he is a nuclear scientist, and he has worked at the nuclear power plant in Energodar. He went over to this type of work for health reasons and started to do business. He currently has goods worth around 210,000 hryvnia. \r\n\r\nAndrei plans to use the loan from Kiva, of the amount of 20,000 hryvnia, to purchase household appliances for selling in the future.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Alicia earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in net sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to find time to travel and\/or relax in a salon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1113297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3733,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3745.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359440},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":4666.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4682.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303257},{"amount":65,"local_amount":2799.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2809.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355980},{"amount":65,"local_amount":2800.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2809.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114087}],"funded_date":"2012-06-11T19:16:30Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy and Andy Gordon","image":1110260}},{"id":435453,"name":"Kim Song","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kim Song is 40 years old.

At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. A dream for most poor Filipino parents, like Melanie (she herself was a college undergraduate), is a college education for their children. It is believed that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nMelanie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Melanie for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 540 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMelanie dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own car. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The youngest son, 16 years old, is now studying in the 7th grade. Felipe earns his living growing beans and corn. He began working in agriculture at the age of 15. When he was 22 years old he got married; that is when he decided to work independently. Today, thanks to the enormous effort and sacrifice he invested during all of those years, he has his animals and his own home. During the bean and corn harvest, aside from the help his sons provide,  he hires paid laborers. Felipe says that at harvest time the buyers come to the region. He sells his crop to them then, locally, since that is the most secure way. Felipe needs this Kiva loan to buy the consumables he needs and to pay part of the cost of the hired labor for the bean and corn harvest. This will be of great benefit to his business.

","en":"Daniel is a 55 year-old widower who has poured all of his creativity and talent into colorful vases and flowers that he has been making by hand for a number of years in his workshop \"Ainter Florez\" in the Las Nieves neighborhood.  To do this, he uses a variety of materials such as craft foam, wood, rope, paints, glue and other materials, which he combines in such a way so as to create the striking products that have been so well received in the market.  Previously, Daniel worked in transportation, but seeing that he had some free time to do another activity to generate income, he accepted the proposal from an acquaintance to sell glass vases, to which he added flowers that he made so that they would be more colorful and attractive to the customers.  This went very well, but he still believed that he could derive more income from his abilities and make more of the vases.  For this reason, he came up with the idea of using wood, a more durable material that he could decorate.  Today, he sells the completed decorative item in the various neighborhoods of the city.  To do this, he relies on a vendor who offers his products for sale, mainly on credit, with weekly or bi-weekly payments.  One of Daniel's main challenges has been to maintain his business with the small amount of working capital that he has, because it is not sufficient to expand into new neighborhoods and respond to his customer's orders.  This is why he is requesting his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy the raw materials and supplies he needs to make more products.  He is certain that this will be successful for his business, because it will make his sales grow, along with his income.  In the future, he would like to acquire a vehicle that would allow him to further develop his work and optimize the use of his time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1113798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy

Aurita earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAurita hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and draw her family more closely to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1113443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Santo Domingo se encuentra en un lugar estrat\u00e9gico de ecuador que une la Sierra y la Costa a trav\u00e9s de una carretera que empieza al nivel del mar cruza toda la cordillera y termina por sobre los 2600 metros de altura. Debido a esta ubicaci\u00f3n c\u00e9ntrica, Santo Domingo ha acostumbrado a ser un punto de convergencia entre las m\u00faltiples culturas que conviven en Ecuador, Sonia comenta como el barrio donde vive es muy diverso ya que hay ind\u00edgenas, afro ecuatorianos, mestizos etc.  Desafortunadamente no todo ha sido bueno para la ciudad en estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, acompa\u00f1ado de este crecimiento econ\u00f3mico acelerado Santo Domingo tambi\u00e9n ha sufrido de los efectos del crimen y el narcotr\u00e1fico.\nDe esta ciudad sale Sonia, ella trabaja en su taller de costura entre 8 y 10 horas al d\u00eda y aparte de eso emplea a otras dos personas.

Eight years ago, she opened her own business in the parish of Rio Verde in Santo Domingo, Ecuador.  Santo Domingo is the third largest city in terms of population, behind Guayaquil and Quito.  Within the last 15 years, this city has experienced an economic boom which has helped to drive development in the region.  Santo Domingo is located in a strategic area of Ecuador with mountains on one side and the coast on the other.  A highway links both areas by starting at sea level and stretches the entire length until it ends at about 2,600 meters above sea level.  Due to its central location, Santo Domingo is accustomed to being a point of convergence among the various cultures that live in Ecuador.  Sonia says that the neighborhood where she lives is very diverse and includes people with indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, Mestizo, and other ethnic roots.  Unfortunately, not everything has been good for the city in recent years.  Along with the rapid economic growth that Santo Domingo has experience, the city has also suffered from the effects of crime and narcotics trafficking.  \r\n<p>\r\nSonia is from this city.  She works in her sewing workshop between 8 to 10 hours each day and employs two other people.  This is the first loan she has requested and plans to use the money to buy fabrics.  She will use these materials to produce a variety of garments and accessories to wear.  Sonia considers the loan to be a help in expanding her production capacity, which will enable her to serve more customers and also hire another person.  Sonia really enjoys what she does and is also very good at it.  The skills she learned as a little girl have enabled her to work and support her family.  If Sonia secures the necessary funds, she will be able to fulfill her dream of improving the quality of life for her and her two children, as well as for the people who work for her.

He lives with his two small children and his partner in the town of La Playa, very close to the sea. Since he was very young he has made a living selling fruit, motivated by his father and sister who make their living in the same way, selling not only fruits but also vegetables and tubers. He was their partner at first, but when he turned twenty he decided to sell lemons door-to-door with a little capital that he was given by his sister and a cousin. On seeing that this was going well, he rented a small stall in the public market where he also offered a variety of fruits such as papaya, blackberries, mango, ripe bananas, and naranjillos (little oranges), among other tropical fruits. He did well with this and acquired many clients, strengthening his business. However, since the year 2009 he has started to work in a private business in the business center, due to which he has had to move the business into his home.\r\n\r\nNowadays, he uses a wheelbarrow from which he sells produce around the neighborhood, where he is well known. He has different shifts at work each week and so his wife helps him when he can't go out to sell. He buys every three days in the public market but sometimes his clients request a greater variety of fruits, which for want of capital he can't provide.

She earns a minimum of Php 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 22,000 loan.

Santo Domingo is a city that is strategically located in central Ecuador between the coast and the mountains.  It has become a central point for transit and commerce.  This city currently has about 600,000 inhabitants.  It also has the unique distinction of having changed provinces.  Santo Domingo was previously part of Pichincha Province, but then became part of the newly formed province of Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas.  The province takes its name from an ancient ethnic group that occupied this area.  This indigenous group known as the Tsachila had a custom of dying their hair red using the pigment from the achiote tree.  Santo Domingo has an average temperature of 25\u00b0C.  What is very interesting is that Santo Domingo is an hour away from the beach on one side and is two hours away from the Andes mountains on the other side.  \r\n<p>\r\nEly maintains his home where he lives with his wife Marianita.  They have three children (ages 13, 11, and 5).  Ely is a traveling milk vendor and has been in business for approximately three years.  His dream is to improve the conditions of his home to make it more beautiful and more secure.  He believes that the home is the key to developing the values of his children.  For this reason, Ely is requesting a loan to acquire more collection tanks and milk so that he can expand the routes that he covers for delivering his product.  This will enable him to sell in greater volume and improve his earnings.  The income that Ely currently earns is not enough to sustain his entire family, especially since he is the only breadwinner in his household.  He is confident that he can meet this challenge before him and fulfill his dream.  Ely is a good man who is very dedicated to his work, but he needs a little help in order to continue growing.

Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Malikie has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now he requires a new loan in order to buy additional jeans, shirts, boots, shoes and shorts. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 350,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Malikie plans to open another shop for his brother who has come from the village. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1102055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for shoes, jeans, shirts and boots.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T14:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T14:00:11Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malikie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":435650,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca lives in Kampala, Uganda.

is a wonderful, enterprising woman of 28. She is the driving force behind her family. She lives with her husband and four children at Mwambalazi, Kenya. Her business is operating a food stall, selling fried food such as chapati (flat bread), cooked beans, cooked rice, etc.  Through her hard work she has built up a strong demand for her products, and she has gradually been expanding and making a better income to reinvest in the items necessary to strengthen the business. Today she lives at her own family business; her husband and children are also involved. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is her second loan with Yehu Microfinance Trust, an organization through which she has acquired loans to boost her business and thus make a better income to continue improving her family's well-being. With this Kiva loan she will purchase basic materials and ingredients, such as corn, flour, oil, sugar and salt. Her greatest challenge is that her working capital does not turn over sufficiently to cover the growing demand. With her Kiva loan she will be able to purchase at discounted rates, in cash, and in a greater volume. With these permanent injections of capital, she will work in order to later achieve her greatest wish: to have an adequate restaurant in a good location.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1113563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

In addition, she has a small store that she has set up in one of the rooms of her home.  The idea of this business arose out of the demand that existed in the area for staple goods and groceries.  The income that she expects from these activities will allow her to obtain greater income to cover her daily needs.\r\n\r\nYtamar requests a loan from Edpyme Alternativa of 2,000 nuevos soles to purchase groceries and staple goods to expand her store, as well as feed for her animals.
