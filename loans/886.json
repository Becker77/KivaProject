At his young age he does several activities for a living. One of them, the one he is requesting a Kiva loan for, is the sale of clothes for ladies and gentlemen, footwear, make up and accessories in general, both in cash and on credit, among family members, friends and neighbors of the area. With the loan he hopes to get working capital that will allow him to buy a higher volume of merchandise for sale, since one of his challenges has been not being able to get some of the orders made by his customers due to the lack of it. He sells both in cash and on credit among family members, friends and neighbors of the area. He is not afraid to make this investment, since by satisfying current demand and diversifying his products, he would get a higher profitability, fact that gives him a lot of confidence. He began working in the commerce business 3 years ago, to have a source of income while he was studying Computer Mechanics at an official educational institution. Thanks to this, nowadays he is able to offer his services at a private company as a mechanic, which is also an income source for him. When he is not at the store his family helps him, especially his sister, with the sales and with helping the customers. For the development of his business he uses some equipment such as: display cabinets, mannequins, showcases. Still, one of his dreams is to expand his store and turn it into a big department store that can generate employment and bigger profits that will allow him to continue studying and become a professional. He considers himself to be a very active young man and very willing to progress."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1113877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise such as clothes, footwear, make up and other miscellaneous items to support his customers' demands ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140123},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149615},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153106},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156678},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":160334},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164075},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167904},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":171821},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175831},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":179933},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":184132},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":196448}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marina Romanisio","image":903469}},{"id":435886,"name":"Soperiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soperiana is married with one child.

She is married with two children, ages 13 and five. She has been farming for 20 years and runs the farm with the help of one farmhand. She produces mainly maize, beans, vegetables and milk for the local market. She runs a retail shop selling farm produce like cereals and vegetables which she sources from her farm as well as from other local farmers. Hellen has requested a loan of 52,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow. She says this will boost her milk output for her family's consumption and income through sale. She plans to establish a milk parlor business in the local market once her milk production stabilizes.

Around 10 years ago, her partner was left without a job and so they decided to look for an alternative source of income.  Initially, with the severance pay they received, they went to the municipality of Maicao in the department of Guajira, which is a border area that many merchants pass through, to buy foodstuffs and non-perishable food products at good prices.  They planned to resell these later at retail prices, mainly to neighborhood shopkeepers, friends, and acquaintances.  Little by little they got more customers who would ask them for all kinds of different items besides food, such as clothing, shoes, and home appliances, among other things.  They gave these customers payment periods of up to 45 days, which is still the sales policy they use.  Clara knows her customers very well and she tries to meet their demands according to the season.

He acquired his experience in agriculture many years ago when he used to raise livestock.  Later, he went to work in a rice company where he was involved in the process from the planting until the point at which the product is ready to be sold.  With all of this experience, he started cultivating his own parcel of land.  He started cultivating half a manzana (a little less than an acre) of land.  He worked very hard, and it required a lot of sacrifice, but it was worth it, because now he has 2 manzanas of land.  He also sells staple grains to help cover the household expenses.  He doesn't sell his products outside the community where he lives because the transportation and selling costs are very high.  So he sells only in the same region where he lives.  He is requesting a loan from Kiva to cultivate another manzana of rice.  This will help him to farm on more land, and thus increase his income.  In the future, he plans to buy an irrigation motor and make some improvements to his house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1113902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to cultivate rice on an additional plot of land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T19:00:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":405.27,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":202.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":202.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":202.64,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":212.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005953},{"amount":212.49,"local_amount":202.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":212.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165746}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T06:02:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":435847,"name":"Maria Antonieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta se dedica a la venta de mercader\u00eda en general, actividad que la inicio como  iniciativa propia para sufragar gastos, el negocio lo vende de forma ambulante  Ahora solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para la compra de pantalones, camisas, ropa de ni\u00f1os, sabanas , ropa interior  entre otros.","en":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta has a business selling general merchandise.

Every day Maria works in her business selling chocotejas, tejas and washing clothes. She works in her business around 5 hours per day and she can service up to 10 customers each day. During her city's holidays she works some more time making chocotejas and tejas, which is a typical confectionery, and tourists always buy a lot. She believes she does well at her job because she has good cooking skills for making sweets and also because she is responsible and careful when she does laundry, which is why customers always recommend her. Maria is very thankful to Kiva lenders since thanks to the help provided she will be able to buy a new washing machine, which will allow her to provide a better service and also do more laundry. She will also be able to buy supplies to make tejas and chocotejas such as milk, chocolate butter and pecans, among others. So she will continue fighting to make her biggest dream come true: \"Build her house out of noble materials\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1113929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

This purchase will help her add variety to her merchandise. One of her risks can be variation in the prices of basic household goods. \r\n\r\nHer aim is to build a large business that will generate better earnings and provide her children with the diet and education they need to develop academically.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1114201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy snacks, cookies, sweets, soft drinks, juices, pastas and personal hygiene products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":31.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.47,"local_amount":65.47,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":65.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294639118},{"amount":33.29,"local_amount":33.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":33.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301484598},{"amount":33.82,"local_amount":33.82,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308477938},{"amount":37.35,"local_amount":37.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":37.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315682625},{"amount":43.19,"local_amount":43.19,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":43.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323084556},{"amount":44.67,"local_amount":44.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":44.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332917212},{"amount":342.21,"local_amount":342.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":342.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339607107}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T19:46:32Z","paid_date":"2013-02-16T11:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":435970,"name":"Elisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisha, a married man, is a resident of Mariakani, Kenya, a town located along a highway that links two Kenyan cities.

He lives together with his partner, with whom he has two little ones; one is just two years old, and the second was born only two months ago. They are life's and God's greatest gift, and for them he will struggle every day to give them a decent life with a lot of love. \r\n\r\nNeptali's humble home is located in the city of Imperial, which is characterized by its hot climate and agriculture - especially the growing of corn and cotton, among other things. Also the people are very friendly and warm. \r\n\r\nNeptali works on a poultry farm. He gets up very early, as he has to be at his job first thing since he's in charge of watching over their feed, cleaning the place where they raise the chickens, and checking their weight, among other tasks. He likes his job very much, and he thinks that's why it's worked out so well for him - because he is responsible and above all does his job with a lot of enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nNeptali is very appreciative and happy that, thanks to help the Kiva lenders have offered him, he will be able to make improvements to his home, like buying windows. Right now his small home does not have windows, and since it's winter and he has small children, they could get sick from the cold. At the same time he will make improvements to his kitchen, and put up a wall to enclose his house and make it more secure. This way he will be able to offer a better quality of life to his family, and complete part of his bigger dream: \"to give his family a better quality of life and his children a good education.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1114212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He has other forms of income since it works sometimes as a bricklayer and also sells the milk his cows produce.\r\n\r\nHe requests the loan to buy some inputs for the garden and to buy wire to repair the fences. Edgar says that this loan will be helpful since he will not have to sell a few pigs that it has because he wants to fatten them more to later sell them at a better price. He will be also able to do the repairs to the fences, which will avoid the cows to step in to the garden.\r\n\r\nHis future plans are, once he sells the crop, to cancel the loan and with profits from the sale of pigs buy some heifers for better income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1114162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some inputs for the garden and to buy wire to repair the fences.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-11T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-11T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Antonio   \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":617.66,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":308.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":308.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":308.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005954},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":308.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971584}],"funded_date":"2012-06-30T15:07:29Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alberto Jaramillo","image":907502}},{"id":435967,"name":"Rina Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rina, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo, con la intenci\u00f3n de invertir m\u00e1s en el negocio comprando se mayor variedad de ropa nueva e invertir\u00e1 en blusas casuales, ropa de caballero, y ropa interior, con esta mercader\u00eda espera poder tener mayor aceptaci\u00f3n con su clientela.\nEl efecto que tuvo con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue positivo pues le ayud\u00f3 a mantener el negocio de las ventas y ha podido generar ganancia para ayudar a su familia, el n\u00facleo familiar se mantiene, y cuenta con mucho entusiasmo para seguir trabajando de la misma manera.\n","en":"Rina, has decided on a new loan, with the intention of investing more in the business buying a greater variety of new clothes, blouses, casual clothing for men, and underwear.

Their business struggles when the price of cassava drops. Heng obtained the first loan from VisionFund in 2010 and he is now leading a loan group to apply for another loan after his first loan was repaid. This previous loan has enabled him to feed his family, providing them with enough food. Heng's group consists of four members and they are all new to VisionFund except him. As the leader, Heng will use his portion to buy fertilizers and seeds for his plantation. Also, he will use a portion of his share of the loan to pay for labor fee. Heng really hopes that this loan will help increase his crop yield and allow him to sell the products when cassava price is high so that he can make more money to better feed his family.

As villagers of Dambae district, her family has been farming rice and growing cassava to support their daily living for six years. One of the main constraints for her family is not having sufficient food to eat. Ann's group consists of two members. Ann has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles while the other group member has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles. After their previous loans ended, they applied for another loan.

Portoviejo has been known for many years as the city of \"Los Reales Tamarindos\".  This group of individuals decided to join together some time ago and form this Communal Bank, which has now received many loans.  To this date, they have been able to improve their small businesses.  They engage in various activities such as agriculture, general trade, services, and other businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place that one can meet Sra. Miriam, age 38.  She is married and has three chidlren (ages 15, 12, and 8).  The two older ones are in high school and the youngest attends elementary school.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n<p>\r\nMiriam is an excellent homemaker who earns her own income so that she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She sells Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women's accessories).  Miriam also sells clothing through catalogs.  Her sales are conducted by going door-to-door.  She takes advantage of her free time and moments when she is not busy in order to make a sale.  Miriam extends credit and collects payments on a weekly basis.  She says that she enjoys selling and has done very well in the four years she has been in business.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy perfumes, trinkets, cosmetics, cr\u00e8mes, and all types of clothing.  Miriam has been with her Communal Bank from the beginning and enjoys the help that the loans have given her.

She says that she has a small coop where she can have up to 100 chickens each season and a pen that holds the pigs.  Clotilde buys the animals when they are small and keeps them between three to four months.  When the animals reach an adequate weight, they are sold to traders who come to her house, who in turn sell them at various markets in the neighboring cities.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy feed and medicines for both her chickens and pigs.

antiques into a career. He started out selling items from his home \u2013 in between shift work at his day job. But about a year ago, he opened his San Juan, Texas business, C. Trading Post, where he sells and trades almost anything, but tries to stick with antiques. Since then, his business has expanded and necessitated this loan.\n\nWhen Apolinar decided to move his business from home to a store, he was informed by the San Juan Economic Development Corporation about Accion Texas Inc., which eventually led to his visiting an Accion office to apply for a business loan. There are no other trading posts in his hometown, which helps Apolinar gain customers and leaves him with a hand up on future competition. The main idea of opening this business was to ensure he had a job, but now he has a career he loves. \n\nApolinar said he wants to create an enjoyable shopping experience. The loan will therefore fund start-up costs including interior and exterior d\u00e9cor, lining the building with insulation, and repairing the floor. Currently, he works alone, but as his business expands, Apolinar plans to employ another person.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5325,"image":{"id":1104038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

is twenty-nine-year-old very kind and friendly young man. He is single and lives with his parents. He has raised livestock for the last five years. He sells them for meat, which is very popular among local people. Many popular dishes like dolma and pilov are made of meat. People consider it very healthy and digestible.\r\n\r\nHicran usually buys calves, raises and fattens them and sells them for profitable price.

She is 60 years old and a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a mother of 2 children, one working, the other staying at home. Together with her children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nAdoracion operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, Php5 worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. Adoracion earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also does direct selling business -- she sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customers order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. She earns a minimum of PHP17,500 in net sales a week.\n\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP50,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and will also use it to buy products for the direct-selling business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\n\nAdoracion hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 42 years old and a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Emilio, who is a vendor. At this time, she is working hard to meet their financial expenses.\n\nNida is a coconut vendor. Most coconuts in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing deep wooden carts. The coconuts are served either by cutting one end and just putting a straw in so the coconuts themselves serve as containers or by offering both the juice and edible part of the coconuts in plastic with a straw. Regular customers are those who are thirsty and those who want to refresh themselves from the heat of the sun. Nida earns a minimum of 1200 Philippine pesos (PHP) per day.\n\nNida is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy tires, wood, nails and paint for a new cart, coconuts, and a cooler for the coconut juice that she'll sell separately. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\n\nNida hopes that her business will continue to be successful. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

He\u2019s an independent painter who works upon client\u2019s requests. He works on different projects and always tries to offer his customers the best results ever. He\u2019s known for being well-organized and on time. \r\n\r\nToday, he\u2019s asking for a youth loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to purchase a car for his business.

It currently has 16 members.  Each one has developed a business activity with the intention of having better living conditions.  This group is from the community of Cerro Mojarra La Capilla, which is located on the shore of a large lake.  Most of the people are fishermen or fishmongers who sell \"mojarra\" (a fish similar to tilapia).  \n\nMargarita is 52 years old and married to Navor, a vendor.  They have four children who are students.  Three years ago, Margarita opened a small grocery store along the main street in her community in hopes of generating income to provide her children with an education and a better life.  She opens her business very early and says she likes having it well-stocked because her customers can always find what they are looking for and return to buy more.  In addition, it should be noted that Margarita's store is located on the edge of the road, so she is able to sell to a few more people who are also coming to buy fish in her community.  Margarita has plans to invest her loan in the purchase of cooking oil, canned foods, candy, detergent, soap, juices, soft drinks, beans, rice, sugar, cheese, cream, milk, chili peppers, and other products to sell.  Her goal is to someday have the opportunity to expand her business even more so that she can provide better service to her customers.  \n\nThe other group members and their business activities are as follows:\n\u2022 Yocunda sells groceries.\n\u2022 Maria sells fish.\n\u2022 Margarita sells fish.\n\u2022 Natalia sells clothing.\n\u2022 Rafael sells fish.\n\u2022 Nohemi sells snacks.\n\u2022 Maria Paula sells chickens.\n\u2022 Alejandra sells groceries.\n\u2022 Adela sells fish.\n\u2022 Marcelino sells frozen popsicles.\n\u2022 Angel Roberto sells fish.\n\u2022 Maria sells fish.\n\u2022 Jacqueline sells food.\n\u2022 Luis sells groceries.\n\u2022 Yadira sells groceries."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6550,"image":{"id":1107144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking oil, canned foods, candy, detergent, soap, juices, soft drinks, beans, rice, sugar, cheese, cream, milk, chili peppers, and other products.

venta de refacciones para autos, tambi\u00e9n tiene un taller mec\u00e1nico en su casa, pero pronto lo cambiar\u00e1 de ubicaci\u00f3n ya que en su casa no hay mucho espacio. \u00c9l inici\u00f3 su negocio gracias a su t\u00edo Luis quien puso su taller mec\u00e1nico y compr\u00f3 las herramientas en un principio. Posteriormente, invit\u00f3 a Juan Manuel a trabajar con \u00e9l; entonces, \u00e9l no sab\u00eda nada de mec\u00e1nica, pero con el apoyo de su t\u00edo aprendi\u00f3 todo lo necesario y ahora incluso disfruta mucho su actividad, una prueba de ello es que pretende mejorar su negocio. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a el \"Negro\" es reparar los motores, mientras que lo que encuentra m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de sobrellevar es la competencia. Juan Manuel sabe que los dem\u00e1s mec\u00e1nicos cobran m\u00e1s barato por reparar los carros y eso lo hace perder clientes. De acuerdo con sus propias palabras, las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener una persona para hacer el tipo de trabajo que desempe\u00f1a es ser amable con los clientes, ser responsable para no dejar trabajo pendiente y honesto para reconocer cuando se equivoca y cuando el trabajo no es de la mejor calidad en lugar de decir que la refacci\u00f3n no tiene la suficiente calidad. Juan Manuel se considera una persona especial por sus ganas de superarse por trabajar para cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.

They are all named Manuel, and so this is why they decided to name their group \"The 3 Manuel.\"  \r\n\r\nJuan Manuel, better known by the nickname \"Negro,\" has a business selling auto parts, and he also has a mechanic's workshop in his house.  However, he will soon move the workshop to another location, because there is not a lot of space in his house.  He started his business thanks to his uncle Luis, who set up his mechanic's workshop and initially bought the tools.  Later, he invited Juan Manuel to work with him.  Back then, Juan Manuel  didn't know anything about mechanics, but with the support of his uncle he learned everything he needed to know, and now he enjoys this activity very much.  One challenge for him is that he wants to improve his business.  What \"Negro\" likes most is to repair motors, while what he finds most difficult is to deal with the competition.  Juan Manuel knows that the other mechanics charge less to repair cars, and this makes him lose customers.  According to his own words, the characteristics that a person must have to do this type of work are: they must be friendly with the customers, they must be responsible to not leave unfinished work, and they must be honest and recognize when they make a mistake and when the work is not of the best quality, instead of saying that the part is not of sufficient quality.   Juan Manuel is considered to be a special person because of his desire to excel in his work so that he can accomplish his dreams.  One of these is to have a bigger mechanic's workshop that is equipped with all of the tools and auto parts needed to provide better service.  \"Negro\" is requesting a loan to buy more automotive parts. \r\n\r\n The other members of the group are: Juan Manuel: who provides mechanic's services, and Jose Manuel, who also provide mechanic's services. \r\n\r\n They thank the Vision Fund for helping all of the hardworking men who want to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1110469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

fishing and rice-growing town of Senanga. He is the first born in his family and has four siblings who all go to school.\n\nOwen is a person who has grown in business. Before he had his own mobile money transfer shop, Owen worked for his father. He says working for his father taught him how to give customers the best possible service and how to develop friendships, both of which he says are important to making his business work. When Owen is not at his shop he is often found at church where he is a part-time pastor.\n\nOwen\u2019s business is located very close to the harbor. He says most of his customers are fishermen and rice growers who normally use his service to send and receive money for business purposes and for their children\u2019s school fees among other things.  He is convinced that his customers love his business because it is convenient to use and cheaper than other money transfer services.\n\nWhen asked what challenges he faces in his business, he cites low working capital as the major one. This, he says, is particularly a challenge when he has a lot of people who want to transact with him. However he is hopeful that once he gets a Kiva loan, he will be able to have more money in his business and be able to do more transactions. This will bring him a lot of joy because it will mean never having to ask another customer to wait to be served.\n\nBeing the first born in his family, Owen wants to lead as a role model for his younger siblings by succeeding at his business, and earn profits which he can use to send them to school.\n\nIn the video, a representative from Mobile Transactions is interviewing Owen.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":1106879,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2601,"youtubeId":"t9EOmvKBymo","title":"Kiva Borrower Owen

He has a service transporting passengers via motorbike. Omar tells us that before he had the motorbike he had a car, with which he worked as a taxi driver, but he was in an accident. Thanks to God, he was not seriously injured. He tells us that he went a period of time without working until he bought the new vehicle. It has been a year since he started working in this way, and up to now it is going very well for him. Omar tells us that he started to work when he was very young, since he has always liked to contribute support to his household. He starts his route at 8 in the morning until 8 at night, charging a fare of $0.50 on his route. He tells us that drivers can't charge more, since they compete with the bus service and it costs $0.25. The majority of his customers are people who are going far out where the buses don't go, and also those who are carrying purchases, and he makes the transport easier for them. In his work his biggest problems are the streets on his route, since they are not paved and are thus in poor condition, causing damage to his motorbike. With the loan, Omar will perform maintenance on his motor taxi, since it needs it, and he will fix up his grandparents' house. His goal for the future is to be able to acquire another vehicle in order to increase his earnings and be able to start a family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1115271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Playas (Villamil)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-11T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-11T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1049.27,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":95.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":101.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":436390,"name":"Amath Satou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Amath est un jeune c\u00e9libataire sans enfants.Il tient une boutique de vente de tissus au march\u00e9 central de sa ville.Il ach\u00e8te en gros dans un pays limitrophe et revend ses produits au d\u00e9tail.Il parvient \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des revenus assez int\u00e9ressants qui lui permettent de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de sa famille.Afin de renforcer son fonds de commerce , il sollicite un pret de 500000f pour acheter des tissus et des articles de mercerie.Son ambition est d'ouvrir une seconde boutique car la premi\u00e8re est devenue trop exigu\u00eb.","en":"Amath is a young single man with no children.  \r\n\r\nHe manages a fabric shop at the central market of his town.

She's 58 years old and runs a grocery store in her house. She's married to Panfilo, who's a fisherman. Her children are adults and lead independent lives. She started the grocery store nine years ago, with help from her husband, who provided her working capital. After that, she requested her first loan, which she used to stock up. Currently, her store is well-stocked, and she gets occasional help from her youngest daughter. In her grocery store she sells rice, sugar, olive oil, salt, provisions, tuna, cleaning producs, etc. She earns a profit margin of 15 to 20%, depending on the merchandise. She opens Monday through Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Luisa tells us that her biggest concern is illness, since because of her age she's prone to suffer from them, but apart from that she doesn't have major problems. With the loan she hopes to purchase goods for selling in the store, in the hopes of getting enough capital to buy a fishing boat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1115272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, sugar, olive oil, salt, provisions and tuna.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":640.14,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":53.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":55.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":57.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":58.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":61.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":95.39,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294286809},{"amount":49.63,"local_amount":48.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":49.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340365},{"amount":50.76,"local_amount":49.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096737},{"amount":52.25,"local_amount":51.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331093},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":52.31,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":53.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939736},{"amount":54.59,"local_amount":53.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072156},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":54.73,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":55.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318515},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":55.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":56.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013259},{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":57.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":58.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453626},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":59.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459476},{"amount":62.08,"local_amount":61.14,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":62.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087818}],"funded_date":"2012-07-01T16:14:58Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":436491,"name":"Mary Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They usually use these loans to pay school fees for their children, invest in their businesses, buy plots of land or house building materials, etc. And at the end of each month, they repay the loan using their monthly salaries. Their finance officer is directly responsible for making repayments on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMuctarr is the leader of this group of teachers. Muctarr is forty-five years of age. A native of Rokulan village, Muctarr is married to a teacher and they have four children attending primary and secondary schools respectively. Muctarr has served in the teaching profession for 28 years now. With his share of this loan, he is going to buy house building materials like iron corrugated zincs, bags of cements, iron rods, etc. in large quantity in order to construct a family dwelling house.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1108398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

At eight in the morning she begins to cook her stews in order to sell them for lunches or mealtime. She says that she likes her work a lot as she gets to know people from all parts of the country that pass by here on their travels. Mrs. Rosa is asking for this loan in order to buy the ingredients that she uses the most in the preparation of her food such as beef, chicken, pork and vegetables such as lettuce, carrots, tomatillos, green tomatoes, chiles, onions, etc. If she receives this loan, with her earnings she will continue to purchase more supplies.\r\nThe other ten members of the group are named Maria Balbina, Adela, Maria Isabel, Maria Santos, Edith, Jose David, Maria Guadalupe, Diana, Karen Bianey and Rosa Maria.

On other occasions, she makes visits by traveling around the city or whenever someone calls her with an order.  June works alone in the daytime since it can become dangerous at night.
