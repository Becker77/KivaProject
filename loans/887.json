She is divorced and has one child. She is a seamstress, working with sewing women's national clothing. She is very skilled in embroidering. \r\n\r\nMarvari rents a studio, where four female seamstresses work. Marvari is the oldest one. The studio has many regular customers, because many skilled seamstresses work there. Marvari's activity is the main source of income. As the wedding season has started, there are many orders from brides at the studio. \r\n\r\nFor the loan received, Marvari wants to buy a sewing machine for the studio.

She is a cheerful and hardworking woman. She is a mother of two children, aged 20 and 17, whom she has gotten ahead with all of her hard work and love as a mother and for whom she gives her life to make happy. The house Beatriz ives in is in the city of Nazca. This city is characterized by its warm climate as well as its agriculture, especially prickly pears, beans, corn and more. Here we also find the Nazca Lines, which are hieroglyphics located on an extensive field of dry land. These served as a type of calendar for the ancient Nazca culture. When she has free time, Beatriz likes to read and make one of her favorite dishes \"Wheat and Steak\". Due to her parents' lack of financial resources, she was only able to go to school up to the fourth year of secondary school, but she would have liked to finish school and study at the university.\r\n\r\nWith much enthusiasm, Beatriz works hard day to day at her business selling groceries in her small store where she lives. She works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 20 customers a day. For Beatriz, her small business is a big help because she can support her home. She thinks that it is going well in her business because she is very friendly to her customers and because she offers good quality at comfortable prices. \r\n\r\nBeatriz is very happy and gratful for the help that has been offered by the Kiva lenders. Thanks to this help she will be able to put in a floor in her house, since right now she has a dirt floor. This way, she and her family can have a better quality of life and offer more comfort to her customers. This will allow her to get ahead and keep working to be able to make her biggest dream come true: \"finish building her house\".

is 33 year-old Backeta. She is married and has two children, age 9 and 5. She has one additional dependent who lives with her.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Backeta established her salon business. She began her business because, after her fourth form, she was not able to continue her schooling and does not want to be dependent on family or relatives.\r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

She likes the fact that this job gives her the flexibility to spend time with her kids and clients at the same time. What she doesn't like, however, is when her merchandise and stock are low and she cannot meet the needs of her customers. For this reason, she is requesting a loan which she plans to invest in stocking her business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support she has received, and promises to make all payments on time. She is also happy to be a member of her local community bank, as her fellow members are kind and responsible people. She hopes this loan will help her to stock her business well so that she can meet her clients' needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1115488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products to stock her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":194.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":210.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":218.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":227.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":231.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.03,"local_amount":338.74,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":340.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401882},{"amount":68.38,"local_amount":182.35,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451815},{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":190.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":191.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446997},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":194.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":195.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052905},{"amount":77.13,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":206.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187918},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":210.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":211.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571964},{"amount":81.85,"local_amount":218.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":219.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121736},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":227.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867681},{"amount":86.74,"local_amount":231.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":232.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576647}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T21:44:45Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":436361,"name":"Immaculate","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Immaculate is married with six children.

En otras ocasiones labora como jornalera en las parcelas de sus vecinos, es as\u00ed como llega a ganar lo suficiente para el sustento de sus hijos.  \nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su actividad es conversar con sus vecinos mientras realizan las cosechas o cuando sacan la maleza. Sin embargo, lo que le preocupa es que tiene que dejar a sus hijos solos mientras trabaja. Su objetivo a futuro es abrir una tienda de abarrotes para estar en casa con sus hijos. Por tal motivo, se esmera en seguir ejerciendo su labor para que las ganancias crezcan y logre su anhelo. \n\nVictoria se siente muy contenta por la oportunidad de cr\u00e9dito y el apoyo de esta microfinanciera. Por lo que promete ser puntual en sus cuotas de pago. Asimismo, agradece a su banco comunal por permitirles participar en el grupo.\nCon los 1,500 nuevos soles de este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar lo que necesita para realizar el mantenimiento de sus plantas (abono y fertilizantes). ","en":"Victoria is a very hard working woman who is responsible for taking care of all five of her children after she and her husband separated two years ago. She and her children live in her father's house, which she inherited when she was single.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she gets up very early to make breakfast for her kids, and then she goes out to tend her coffee plants and lands. She sometimes works as a day laborer on her neighbors' lands in order to make a living and provide for her children.\r\n\r\nHer favorite aspect of her job is chatting with her neighbors while they are harvesting or tending crops, or when they are pulling weeds on their land. What worries her, however, is that she has to leave her children alone while she works hard all day to provide for them. Her goal for the future is to open a general store out of her home so that she can be with her children and work at the same time. For that reason, she works as hard as she can to save up money to achieve her dream.\r\n\r\nVictoria is very grateful for the support and the opportunity to receive this loan, and she promises to make all payments on time. She is grateful to her local community bank for letting her be a member of the group. With the 1,500 nuevos soles in this loan she plans to purchase manure and fertilizers for maintaining and tending her coffee plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1115491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase manure and fertilizers for her coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":122},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":131.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":142.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":154.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":157.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":163.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":170.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":174.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401883},{"amount":50.54,"local_amount":131.84,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":135.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456157},{"amount":52.38,"local_amount":136.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":140.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451816},{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":142.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":146.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446998},{"amount":55.85,"local_amount":145.7,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":149.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052906},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":154.13,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":158.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187919},{"amount":123.19,"local_amount":321.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":330.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121737},{"amount":65.46,"local_amount":170.77,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867682},{"amount":66.92,"local_amount":174.58,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":179.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576648}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T16:55:49Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":436535,"name":"Eladia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Es importante darle mantenimiento periodicamente a las viviendas, por lo que la sra.

She is married to Gregorio, who is 58, and they have two children from this marriage: Goyo, who is 16, and Aldo, who is 13. They live in a house built with rustic materials, which they bought twenty years ago. \r\n\r\nVilma has worked selling groceries for ten years, and purchases her products in the city of San Francisco, located one hour away from her community. She makes her sales on her own, since her children go to school and her husband works mainly in a small farm. What she likes best about her job is serving her customers, because that is something that doesn't require much effort. Her greatest hope is for her children to become professionals, which is why she and her husband put a lot of effort into their work. With the profits her husband obtains from his harvests and with Vilma's store sales, they manage to cover their children's schooling expenses, and also to increase the variety of products at her store. In spite of this, Vilma needs a loan in order to improve what she has achieved so far, by further stocking her store. \r\n\r\nThat is why she is very happy to receive support from this microfinancing institution, because she feels confident that her business will move forward. She also enjoys being a part of her communal bank because she works with committed people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2,000 nuevos soles from this loan to stock up on merchandise to fill her store with rice, sugar, drinks, vegetables, etc. "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1115501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products to stock her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":194.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":210.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":218.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":227.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":231.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.05,"local_amount":162.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":163.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401884},{"amount":65.98,"local_amount":175.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":176.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456158},{"amount":68.38,"local_amount":182.35,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451817},{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":190.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":191.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446999},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":194.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":195.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052907},{"amount":77.13,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":206.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187920},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":210.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":211.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571965},{"amount":81.85,"local_amount":218.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":219.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121738},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":227.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867683},{"amount":86.74,"local_amount":231.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":232.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576649}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T16:43:50Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":436669,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome is a 23 years old business lady and a single mother of one child aged 3 years.

Cutuglagua is one of the parishes with the highest population growth in Pichincha province. It is still developing in order to offer a better quality of life to all its inhabitants, who arrive from provinces all over Ecuador. Many areas in the parish don't have basic services such as water, electricity, sewer, and garbage collection. \r\n\r\nFor three years now, Yolanda has been working very hard under these living conditions in order to provide for her young daughter, because being a single mother, she doesn't get support from her child's father. She sells mangoes on the street, with sugar, cinnamon, or salt. Yolanda decided to set up her business on the street because there is a lot of demand for her product in the city, especially among school children.\r\n\r\nOne of the obstacles Yolanda has had to overcome was a lack of support when she was starting her business, as well as the permits required in order to move around freely and offer her product. Her days are hard and long, but every one of them has its reward, when after eight long hours of work she is able to come home to her daughter Katerine and share beautiful moments of mother-daughter quality time.\r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to be able to increase her amount of raw materials, so that she can expand her business to the surrounding areas of Machachi. Her dream is to be able to save up and buy a house where she can live with all the comforts she needs to give her daughter a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1115851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase mangoes and fruit for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.66,"local_amount":79.08,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092752},{"amount":82.49,"local_amount":81.89,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":82.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334556},{"amount":83.46,"local_amount":82.86,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390480},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":84.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":85.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149470},{"amount":87.2,"local_amount":86.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382595},{"amount":88.42,"local_amount":87.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":88.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989682},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":89.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":90.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126094},{"amount":91.89,"local_amount":91.22,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516695},{"amount":93.67,"local_amount":92.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":93.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068560},{"amount":292.63,"local_amount":290.51,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494835}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T00:56:28Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":436860,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Huanca De Cusco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece  al banco comunal SE\u00d1OR DE HUANCA DE CUSCO;

Unusually, Santo Domingo has recently become part of a new province as - not so long ago - the city used to be part of Pichincha province. Since 2007 it has been Santo Domingo de los Tsachillas.\r\nSegundo started his  business 15 years ago in Santo Domingo, working in what is traditionally the city's most popular industry: agriculture. Currently, Segundo is a lone parent who has been responsible for his two children since separating from his partner. While working he has learned about his business and the required skills alongside one of his sons. Segundo is now applying for a loan to enable him to invest in buying more seeds to allow him to expand his production. He works around 8 hours each day, but he believes that he could increase his supply if he worked more. Segundo is hoping that this loan will give him the opportunity to continue growing his business and, as such, to earn a greater income for his own benefit and that of his children."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1115878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds in order to increase his production level.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T20:20:06Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo Diogenes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":93.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Reiss","image":798183}},{"id":436887,"name":"Ysabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Ysabel naci\u00f3 en la hermosa ciudad del Cusco, ella vive en la ciudad donde naci\u00f3 y  donde desarrolla sus actividades econ\u00f3micas, ella es viuda pero tiene ocho hijos. \n\nLa socia Ysabel es una mujer emprendedora y trabajadora que saca adelante a su familia y se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de chompas de lana de alpaca.

For this reason he has become a farmer, as this is what he is very good at; on top of this he earns a good income from selling his beans. He and his wife spend most of their time at their plot of land, since they have a small house where they take shelter during the rainy seasons. During the harvest seasons they contract day laborers who collect the fruits very quickly, but for whom is very hard to carry the heavy sacs, because they end up with a backache. This is why his biggest desire is to buy a motorcycle truck, even though right now what he needs the most is to buy new coffee plants.\r\n\r\nThus is his 8th loan with MFP and he is grateful for the trust he has been granted as this will help him carrying on with his working plans.

The house they live in is made of basic material, and they have succeeded in buying it during the 10 years they have been living together.

The city and its inhabitants have benefited from its rapid economic growth during the last 2 decades. The main economic accelerators have been tourism, commerce and agriculture. However, unfortunately economic growth has not benefited all as there is a significant section of the population which has remained on the margins of this growth; furthermore, it has also brought an increase in certain illegal activities such as crime and drug trafficking. Santo Domingo has a tropical, humid climate and is located at around 200m above sea-level.\r\nNeris started her sales business, pedaling her wares as she walked, in this important city. It was difficult for her to set up her business and to obtain the necessary resources as she has completed only her high school studies and, consequently, her opportunities were considerably reduced.

Clementina has received and repaid empowerment credit one time from GHAPE. Her previous loan was very helpful to her as she invested it in her business, and used her profit to pay school fees and hospital bills for her children and also to build her workshop.\r\n    \r\nThe main challenges Clementina has faced in her life are poverty, ill health, and the death of her husband. Worst of all was after the death of her husband when Clementina's in-laws confiscated all her property, leaving her with nothing to take care of her family.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan she intends to invest in sewing underwear and the purchase and sale of firewood. She is very sure this business will be successful because she has a lot of experience in it. Also, she believes that this activity will be of help to the community because they will always have firewood and good underwear available. \r\n\r\nShe will use the profit from her loan to increase her business capital, to educate and provide medication for her family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1115722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for cloth and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

Alicia says that she got her business going thanks to the support of her daughter, Maria del Rosario, who gave her the idea of selling groceries.  Later, they began to buy consumer staples such as sugar, coffee, eggs, chilies, tomatoes and detergent.  Over time, Alicia and her daughter realized that the business was profitable, and they set out to invest more in it.  Now the products they sell the most are: soft drinks, coffee, sugar, tomatoes, onions and eggs.\r\n\r\nIn running her business, Alicia must practice certain qualities, including friendliness to her customers.

But her daughter is always with her, helping her to clean her store.  Alicia says that she is considered to be a special person because she likes to feel useful, in spite of her age, and she has a strong desire to keep working.

This type of work helps her family get ahead -- she is married and has 2 children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health training and the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5025,"image":{"id":1115976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cloth to make clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-06-13T03:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-13T03:10:14Z","loan_amount":5025,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesarea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisel Rene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":34848.49,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4978.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4978.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":717.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":717.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":717.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1435.73,"local_amount":9956.82,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9992.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441299},{"amount":717.86,"local_amount":4978.41,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495236},{"amount":717.87,"local_amount":4978.41,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260780},{"amount":717.86,"local_amount":4978.41,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490491},{"amount":717.87,"local_amount":4978.41,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095351},{"amount":717.81,"local_amount":4978.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4995.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235444}],"funded_date":"2012-07-08T21:24:25Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":436043,"name":"Mumkunat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Mumkunat 51 letnaya pensionerka.

She has been accustomed to housework and taking care of cattle since her childhood.  She lives with her parents, sisters, and brother, who always support her.  At the present time, she has three cows, a calf, and eight sheep.  Increasing the size of the herd has been very difficult since the price of feed has jumped and sales of cattle have surged.  Zarbibi also grows agricultural products.

is 66 years-old, a widow, and an industrious woman who has been living in Baray district of Kompong Tom province. She is a mother of three children, one of whom live separately with their new family. For Pol\u2019s family, rice farming is the main business, which she can generate her income to support the living needs. However, she just owns and cultivates rice on a few plots of her existing farmland. Therefore, the income seems barely enough to cover her daily expenses due to the high cost of commodities. And recently, her two single children are working in various jobs, a construction worker and a garment factory worker, so that they can help their mother earn the income and raise the family out of poverty.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of a vehicle for commuting to their workplaces, Pol\u2019s children are experiencing difficulties and they have to pay a lot for taking motor-taxi services. To reduce the expenses on transportation fees, Pol decided to ask for a loan from HKL in the sums of KHR 2,000,000 to purchase a second-hand motorcycle to be used in the family.

She lives with her family in Klaeng Poar village, Prey Chor district, Kompong Cham province. She has many duties being a good wife and mother. She is a well-managed person who always takes care of all household things in a neat and tidy way. She cooks for family, and provides education to her children at home. Besides all this, she devotes herself to feed and look after her pigs every day. For additional income, Hong also acts herself as a middleman who buys matured poultry from local villagers and sells them to frequent customers in local markets.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a vehicle for use by the family as well as the business, Hong has applied for a loan of $US1,500 to purchase a motorcycle. She will use it to provide good transportation services for her family.

Her husband, Francisco, has been working as a master builder for 11 years.  Her children are all professional adults with their own families.\n\nAna has a grocery store located at home.  She tells us that she started out selling snacks from a window in her house and gradually improved her economic situation so she opened the store.  She currently has a well-stocked store where she sells basic staple items of daily consumption.  She works Monday through Sunday all day.  She comments that at the beginning it was difficult because she had to win over customers and competition is tough.  She thanks God that she\u2019s been well-received.\n\nShe tells us that what\u2019s difficult about her work is transportation of merchandise.

After I finished school, I studied further because I needed more experience, and the tools and materials I needed were beyond my financial reach.\"\n\n\"I have to search everywhere to make sure I am getting good quality woods, otherwise they cannot be carved properly and this affects my sculptures. I work with a team of carvers, and we all agree that it is essential to have a considerable stock of wood. This interest-free microcredit will make it possible.

For three years, he has had a taxi and has been a taxi driver, which has been a profitable project, but needs more support to cover the costs.\n\nAbdullah is requesting a USD youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new motor for the taxi. This will increase the taxi's efficiency, enabling Abdullah to work extra hours and improve his income to ensure a better future for himself. Abdullah is pictured next to his taxi.\n\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has been taking out loans from our organization since 2006. She is a very punctual and responsible person. She never broke any loan conditions. She sews traditional bedding at home, and before that she used to sell men\u2019s clothing at the marketplace.
