At first it went very well.  With her capital, she was traveling periodically to Maicao to purchase products that come from neighboring Venezuela.  She increased her sales and was able to offer new products.  However, at the end of last year, she was presented with some problems because due to security and other restrictions, the border guards were not letting any type of merchandise through to the retailers.  This caused her to lose time and money, and her sales were affected.  To cope with this challenge, she decided not to travel anymore.  Instead, she sells merchandise based on customer orders, such as bermuda shorts, sweaters, shorts, jeans, and domestic appliances such as TVs and washers, that she buys right here in her city, and she sells mainly on credit.  This business has been well-accepted by her customers, and it has been going so well for her that she wants to buy a greater volume of merchandise with this loan so that she can meet the demand.  She gives thanks to Kiva, because Kiva has given her the opportunity to expand her business, and she hopes to be able to continue to rely on this great support.

There she started out selling fruit; later, her father (who had taken on running the business because she had gotten a job as a contractor) took advantage of the knowledge he had as a butcher and added the sale of meats to the business. So, with time, the business continued becoming stronger and attracting more customers all the time. But that was not enough for Erika; recognizing that her business was very strategically located, she decided to take advantage of that. She purchased a hydraulic pump and began offering a vehicle washing service, which has been very well received and successful so far. \r\n\r\nErika has her family's help in staffing her business; for that reason, her biggest dream is to continue growing and eventually have a large store that can accommodate everyone and earn greater profits to improve her and her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1116067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy baskets and a table to display the fruits and tubers that she sells, and to expand their variety.

That is why she is asking for a Kiva loan to have capital available to buy the items to respond quickly to her customers' demands. Milagros buys from suppliers in the city of Bogot\u00e1 on consignment. Once they get the money, they send the merchandise to her via airmail and she has to go pick it up at the airport in the city of Barranquilla. These replacement parts and accesories have already been ordered by her private customers and by locales in malls that specialize in selling computers. This activity has been a big help for her, since it has allowed her to finish her studies and pay for household expenses. This will be her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She is very gratefule for them because she has been able to capitalize her business and extend credit to her customers, something she was not able to do and that affected her sales. Milagros is 20 years old. She is in a common law marriage in the Las Nieves neighborhood with her permanent partner. Her biggest dream is to have her own locale where she can offer her technical services and sell accesories.

She said,\u201d things are looking up for my family now and I am very much happy at the moment.\u201d She continued saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got plans now to send my daughter to school and she has been excited since she learned the news.\u201d\r\n\r\nLeta has applied for her first loan through VisionFund Albania. She wants to add one more cow to increase the dairy products. She is seeking lenders\u2018 assistance in this matter and is promising them that she will pay off the loan without delay.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1116481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married to Gina, a factory worker, and a father to his children. He, together with his wife and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnthony operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Anthony earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He also maintains a buy-and-sell business. He earns a minimum of Php 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nAnthony hopes to be able to expand soon.

Marie would like to use this loan to buy seven boxes of fish and 20 crates of soda for her business so that she can avoid experiencing a break in her stock.  \r\n\r\nMarie's ambitions for her family are to build a house from permanent materials so that she can guarantee their security."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1116661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase her stock of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Douala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-06-14T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-14T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20670},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21457},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22244},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23033},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23820},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24607},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25394},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26181},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26968},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27755},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28542},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29329}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.62,"local_amount":20670,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":20822.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301316078},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":21457,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":21614.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914711},{"amount":6.16,"local_amount":3212,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3235.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331046955},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":19032,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":19172.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436754},{"amount":18.19,"local_amount":9493,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9562.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989170},{"amount":25.95,"local_amount":13540,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":13639.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364436958},{"amount":407.47,"local_amount":212596,"processed_date":"2013-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":214160.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409993260}],"funded_date":"2012-06-15T00:48:35Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T08:55:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":436811,"name":"Akwadu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a community based group called Akwadu (banana), with eight females and two males.

traslad\u00f3 con sus padres desde su ciudad natal a la vecina ciudad de Barranquilla.  Vive en el barrio Siete de Abril donde se dedica desde hace tres a\u00f1os al comercio de ropa para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os y de perfumes.  Con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado quiere comprar principalmente jeans, perfumes e incursionar en el calzado, ya que cuenta con clientes fijos que le han hecho encargos con anterioridad.  Desde los  14 a\u00f1os sabe lo que es trabajar, empez\u00f3 como empleada del servicio dom\u00e9stico en una casa de familia, lo que le impidi\u00f3 terminar sus estudios de bachiller, sin embargo, sus padres siempre le ense\u00f1aron buenas costumbres y a trabajar para conseguir lo que quer\u00eda.  Cuando ten\u00eda 23 a\u00f1os se une al hombre con el que vive actualmente en uni\u00f3n libre, este es voceador de peri\u00f3dicos ambulante y de cuya uni\u00f3n nacen sus tres hijos, hoy mayores de edad.  Es una familia unida y se colaboran entre s\u00ed para solventar los gastos familiares.  Naida a\u00fan labora como empleada del servicio y sus principales clientes son empleados como vigilantes de edificios cercanos a donde labora, al igual que compa\u00f1eras de oficio, estos le hacen encargos de la mercanc\u00eda y le cancelan quincenalmente cuando cuando reciben su salario.  No teme al hacer la inversi\u00f3n, ya que hasta la fecha con sus clientes le ha ido muy bien y la cercan\u00eda con ellos le permite una recuperaci\u00f3n efectiva de la cartera.  Su principal sue\u00f1o es mudarse a una casa grande donde pueda albergar a toda su familia.  Naida es una mujer luchadora que no se le amedranta a nada, considera que todo lo que emprende le sale bien y hasta el momento no ha tenido ninguna dificultad. ","en":"Naida, 58 years old, is a woman from Cartegenia. At a very young age, she moved with her parents from her birth city to the neighboring city of Barranquilla. She lives in the Siete de Abril neighborhood where, for the past 3 years, she has made a living by selling clothes for women, men, and children, in addition to perfume. \r\n\r\nWith this requested loan, she wants to buy mainly jeans and perfumes, and also venture into shoe sales since her regular customers have made shoe orders. For 14 years, Naida knows what it means to work. She began as a domestic service employee in a family home. This prevented her from completing her high school studies. However, her parents always taught her good habits and how to work in order to achieve what she wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 23 years old, she was united with the man she currently lives with in a common law marriage. He is a traveling newspaper vendor. From their marriage, they have three children, who are now adults. They have a close family and they work together to pay the household expenses. Naida still works as a service employee and her main customers are employed as security guards at buildings near where she works. Some customers are also office workers, who make merchandise orders and then pay for them every two weeks when they receive their paychecks. She is not afraid of making this type of investment since, thus far, everything has gone very well with her customers and the closeness to them allows her an effective profit. \r\n\r\nHer main dream is to move into a large house that can accommodate her whole family. Naida is a hard-working woman who is not afraid of anything. She thinks that everything that she has set out to do has gone well and up to this point, she has not had any difficulties."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1116172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy jeans and perfumes, and to venture into shoe sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-14T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-14T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":82685,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84375.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338902},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":84615,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":86344.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395453},{"amount":49.81,"local_amount":86589,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":88359.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775243},{"amount":50.97,"local_amount":88609,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":90420.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387238},{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":90677,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":92530.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994076},{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":92793,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":94689.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130436},{"amount":54.62,"local_amount":94958,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96899.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519310},{"amount":55.9,"local_amount":97174,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":99160.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071147},{"amount":57.2,"local_amount":99441,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":101473.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497370},{"amount":58.53,"local_amount":101761,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":103841.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527207},{"amount":121.2,"local_amount":210698,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":215005.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927986}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T13:59:23Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":437322,"name":"Rashida Bibi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashida bibi is 44 years old, married, and has six children.

He lives with his family in his village house: his wife Manana, a 19-year-old son, and a 12-year-old daughter. Zakaria requested loans from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and the family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZakaria is an agricultural worker in the village and earns on average 100 Laris per month. His wife works as a nanny in the local kindergarten. The total average monthly income of the family is 350 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZakaria requested an agricultural loan from Credo for starting a small-scale agricultural business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to  rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, and who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Zakaria will purchase calves. He will grow them and after a year, when the cows start giving milk, he will start producing traditional Georgian cheese. Zakaria and Manana will sell the cheese on the local open market. They have experience in running a dairy farm, as they used to run one, but five years ago the family stopped the business, and sold the cows, as they urgently needed money. \r\n\r\nThe purchased calves will be placed in the old cattle-shed, located in their yard. They will move the grass and prepare hay for feeding the calves in the winter months. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented through the Kiva loan the family's income will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is the mother of 7 children who she has had to work hard to support because their father abandoned the family when the children were still very young.  She has carried on, though, despite the hardships.  She lives in a modest house in the city of Nazca.  Nazca is known for its mild climate and for the famous Nazca Lines, huge hieroglyphs carved into the hard earth by the ancient Nazca culture and believed to be a sort of calendar.  Farms in the area produce beans, maize, etc.  Nores likes to watch television when she can spare the time for it.  She especially likes telenovelas because they are a happy distraction from her everyday worries.  She would have liked to have gone to college, but her parents couldn't afford it and she was only able to finish a few years of high school.\r\n\r\nNores operates a business selling fruits, vegetables and groceries at a local market.  She works 10 hours a day and sees up to 20 customers.  She says that she is happy with the business and that it is successful because she provides a good service and good products at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nNores is grateful to Kiva lenders because your loans have allowed her to stock the merchandise--onions, potatoes, lemons, beer, mineral water, etc.--she needs to stay in business.

Her loan request was approved because of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to loans, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Natela will cultivate the family-owned 0.3 hectares of land and sow maize. In particular, with the loaned amount she will rent a tractor for tilling the land and purchase maize for sowing. She will work hard on the plot during summer period to get a good harvest in early fall. Natela will sell harvested maize on the local open market.

She is 25 years old and lives with her uncle. Inga\u2019s uncle is an agricultural worker in the village, and Inga is unemployed. The total average monthly income of the family is 150 GEL. According to Credo estimations, Inga and her uncle belong to the \"vulnerable poor\" category. Inga has requested loans from local financial institutions for an agricultural business start-up several times, but her loan requests were rejected because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nInga requested an agricultural loan from Credo to start a small-scale agricultural business. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages providing start-up and re-start credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income levels. \r\n\r\nWith the loan credit, Inga will cultivate her family's 0.4 hectare property. In particular, she will rent a tractor for tilling the land and purchase maize for sowing. Inga will work hard on the plot during the summer to get a good harvest in early fall, and she will sell the harvested maize at the local open market. As a result of the Kiva loan, Inga will earn additional income and will use it to improve her living conditions.

Every morning, she heads out to her farmland where she looks after her corn, banana, and coffee crops.  These crops are the most satisfying to grow, but she also plants cassava and avocados.  She gets very excited whenever it is time to harvest the coffee and treats it as if it were a special event.  Felicitas will hire workers and prepare food for them while they work in the fields.  In addition, she has animal pens where she raises chickens and pigs that are eventually sold once they have been fattened.  According to her, she enjoys working in the fields.  Later on, she plans to increase her production and acquire more land.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP and she is grateful to everyone who has helped to provide her with microloans over the years so that she could continue her work.

She lives in a small village in Kobuleti District with her husband, Nugzar, and her 30-year-old son. The family members earn their living through agricultural business. They run a dairy farm with four milking cows and five calves. They produce cheese and curds. Part of the milk products is used by the family and the other part is sold locally. Along with the above-mentioned activities, the family owns a plot of the land. The family is especially busy with the plot in spring and summer seasons. They grow maize, potatoes and nuts. During spring and summer months, they perform seasonal agricultural works to get a good harvest in late summer. The family sells the harvested product in the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 500 Laris. \r\n\r\nNatela requested a loan to purchase calves. She will raise them and after one year will have more cows on the farm.

Her dreams include buying a truck so that she can transport the products she buys at low cost.  She is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza for the opportunity to receive a loan that she can invest into her business.  Maria also feels comfortable working with her Communal Bank group, which is very unified and supportive.  With respect to the training classes that are offered during the meetings, she has learned how to better manage her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nSan Fernando is a city located in the region of Libertador General Bernardo O\u00b4Higgins, an area in central Chile.  The main business activities in this city are agriculture (vineyards and the cultivation of beets, fruits, tobacco, wheat, and other traditional crops), agro-industries (companies that export fruit, preserves, dairy products, and other commodities), and general trade.

But, Kurt is also a writer who self-publishes novels, poetry and non-fiction inspired by his 15+ years of experience as a messenger. He has published five works thus far. He says, \"My business is 100% a passion of mine! Ever since I was young I have been writing. After years being a bike messenger and getting to know every part of this city. I realized I had stories that other people would like to hear.\" \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kurt was featured in the NYTimes. He was quoted saying, \"I\u2019ve been to so many bodegas and stores all over the city, traveled so many train lines, seen so many different communities and people and it hit me: This American Dream thing is real. People actually come as far away as India or China and start a business and actually work to believe in this thing. I took it for granted, but now I believe it. I actually experienced it.\" \r\n\r\nKurt has had the opportunity to collaborate with many great artists, photographers, writers, filmmakers and other bikers on his books and messenger bag designs. He will used this loan to print more copies of his most popular books \u2013 Asphalt Warrior & New York Alleycat - and attend upcoming festivals where he plans to sell them. In the future he would like to enhance e-commerce functions on his website to sell more books directly to customers. \r\n\r\nYou can check out the article here:

She lives in the city of Ica, which is characterized by its hot climate and welcoming people. She has always been a very hardworking and enthusiastic woman who dedicates all her efforts to bettering herself and coming out ahead. Unfortunately, owing to a lack of financial resources she was not able to study to be a nurse, as she wanted so much. But she wants to do it one day. Ana is very religious, and in her free moments she likes to dedicate a little time to reading, especially reading the Bible. Sometimes when she visits her parents she cooks some very delicious \"Tallarines Rojos,\" (homestyle Peruvian spaghetti in red sauce) to pamper them. \r\n\r\nThanks to her great desire to overcome, and thanks to the support of her mother, Ana began her small business selling hardware items. She works at her business approximately ten hours each day, and can wait on an average of 45 customers each day. Ana believes that her business is going well owing to the good prices and the friendly, respectful treatment she offers her customers.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful to the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the offered help she'll be able to buy merchandise such as knives, nails, bolts, brackets, sealant, pipes, wire, and other general hardware items. In this way Ana will have her business better supplied, and she'll be able to increase her sales and financial income. With this increase, little by little, she wants to be able to accomplish her great dream of being able to study nursing and having a bigger hardware store; and in a not-too-distant future being able to have branches of her store in different parts of the

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercedes operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

daba su madre para que se ganara un porcentaje por venta.   Fue as\u00ed como emprendi\u00f3 su camino como comerciante, distribu\u00eda la mercanc\u00eda entre sus conocidos, amigos y vecinos del barrio Terranova del municipio de Soledad que le cancelaban a cr\u00e9dito con plazos quincenales y mensuales.  En el mes de mayo del a\u00f1o 2011, se vincul\u00f3 a dos empresas muy reconocidas de venta por cat\u00e1logo ya que deseaba ofrecer no solo ropa sino productos de tocador como cosm\u00e9ticos, perfumes, bisuter\u00eda y otros para el cuidado personal.  Con su credikiva quiere tener capital disponible para seguir comprando los productos, trabajando tranquilamente sin importar los plazos otorgados a sus clientes; algunas veces en estos cat\u00e1logos se presentan productos con muy buenos precios ofertados que desea adquirir para vender y ganar un buen margen de rentabilidad. Actualmente cuenta con 20 clientes fijos y algunos ocasionales a quienes tambi\u00e9n les ofrece mercanc\u00eda. Karina tiene 19 a\u00f1os, vive en uni\u00f3n libre y tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os pero aunque su vida gira r\u00e1pidamente alrededor de su familia y su negocio, no le falta tiempo para so\u00f1ar.  Ella quiere en un futuro no muy lejano y as\u00ed como va, ir introduciendo nuevas l\u00edneas de productos para vender de todo un poco y comprar una vitrina en la que pueda exhibirlos, todo esto pensando siempre en el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de su familia y de su negocio. ","en":"Wanting to do a job that would generate income for her to help with the family expenses, when she was still a minor in 2010, Karina decided to sell jeans, blouses, bathing suits, and other garments that her mother gave her so she could earn a percentage per sale.  This was how she set out on the road as a merchant.  She distributed the merchandise to her acquaintances, friends, and neighbors in the Terranova neighborhood in the town of Soledad, and they paid them off on credit with bimonthly and monthly deadlines.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011 she connected with two very well-recognized catalogue-sales businesses because she wanted to sell not only clothing but also beauty products such as cosmetics, perfume, costume jewelry, and other personal-care products.  Sometimes in these catalogues there are products on special offer with very good prices that she wants to get, to sell and earn a good profit margin.  Currently she has 20 steady customers and some occasional ones whom she also want to offer merchandise.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan she wants to have disposable capital to continue buying products, working peacefully without worrying about the deadlines given to her customers.\r\n\r\nKarina, 19, lives in a common-law relationship and has a three-year-old child.  Although her life revolves quickly around her family and her business, she doesn't lack time for dreaming.  In the not-too-distant future she wants to be introducing new lines of products, to sell a little bit of everything, and buy a display case in which to show them--in all of this, always thinking about the economic growth of her family and her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1116844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products from catalogues and clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-15T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-15T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69087},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70699},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72349},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74037},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75764},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":77532},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":79341},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":81191}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.3,"local_amount":69087,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":71453.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338905},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":70699,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":73120.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395456},{"amount":85.39,"local_amount":146386,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151399.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387240},{"amount":102.16,"local_amount":175132,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":181130.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071150},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":138696,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":143446.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498091}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T11:17:38Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:44:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":437489,"name":"Kerin Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kerin, est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para poder iniciar una nueva inversi\u00f3n en el negocio de helados, compr\u00e1ndose una variedad de sabores en sorbetes, conos, paletas, y otros productos que son necesarios en variedad para poder ofrecer a sus clientes.\nEl manifiesta que con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior pudo realizar una buena inversi\u00f3n de la cual agreg\u00f3 un vendedor m\u00e1s que le ayuda a distribuir en otras zonas de la ciudad, considera que su negocio hoy en d\u00eda es m\u00e1s rentable y por lo mismo ha mejorado su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y ha podido contribuir a las necesidades del hogar.\n","en":"Kerin is requesting a new loan so that he can start another investment in his ice cream business.

She is married to Cesar, and a mother to a three children; two of whom are in high school, while the youngest is still in elementary grade. By the grace of God, she has managed to support their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nLewelyn has operated a farm for almost 7 years now. She plants seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines like pineapples, peanuts, bananas and other Filipino fruit staples which are grown mostly in the south region of Luzon. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seeds and other tools for maintenance of the farm. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLewelyn dreams to be able to send all her children to college.

They live together in a house that she inherited from her parents.  Esther resides in the central jungle in the District of Peren\u00e9.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has been a farmer for 20 years and has parcels of land that she bought through hard work and with savings.  Throughout this entire time, Esther learned how to produce coffee and bananas.  Once harvested, she trades her products in the city of Santa Ana, which is 20 minutes away from her town.  \"I have three parcels of land.  This month, I'm harvesting on one of them and the other two were recently planted,\" mentions Esther.  Now she is planning to prepare new coffee seedlings for planting on two other parcels of land that she is renting.  Esther also owns a motorcycle taxi that her oldest son drives in order to provide transportation services and generate additional income for her family.  She is confident that her new crop will result in more income that she can use to support her three children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP and she is grateful for the support she has received this entire time.  Esther says that she will be punctual with her monthly loan payments.  The money from this loan will be used to buy 18 bags of fertilizer and organic compost.  Each one costs around 200 PEN.  This will enable her to start sectioning out the coffee seedlings for planting.

","en":"Gulnora is one of the most active, punctual, and honest customers of MDO Arvand, LLC with a long history of taking loans. She took her first loan of 500 somoni when her business was still very small. She found Arvand through word of mouth, requested financial support, and then took a chance. Using her loan, Gulnora purchased a new lot of merchandise and began traveling outside the city to sell it. There are no large shopping centres in the countryside, and so Gulnora's business rapidly flourished. In a very short time, she greatly increased her financial resources, all the while working with Arvand. Gulnora believes that MDO Arvand, LLC was the reason for the success of her business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gulnora sells men's clothing in the countryside, where she travels four times per month.

One day, with the little bit of money we each could contribute, we bought bolts of fabric and spools of yarn and thread. With these materials, we created our first pieces to sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been able to create more and more textile art over time. This is wonderfully helpful to all of us \u2014 my family as well as the women who work with me. We all have families and we want to get ahead in life. It's great to be able to keep this art form alive.
