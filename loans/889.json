Supported by his family, Buana has continued his profession as a silversmith. \"I've been around handicrafts all my life. I am thankful to God for giving me such a great gift so I can make a living for my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful that all of you got together to create these funds for me to invest in materials.

He is married to Lolita, a housewife and mother to their three children. By the grace of God, Roberto has managed to support his family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nRoberto operates a farm. He plants seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines, like pineapples, bananas, and other Filipino fruit staples which are grown mostly in the southern region of Luzon. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 from sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a loan of PHP 11,000. He will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and other tools for the maintenance of the farm. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Roberto faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Con el producto de lo ahorrado en sus empleos, hace 10 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 invertir en la venta a cr\u00e9dito de ropa por encargos entre sus vecinos y amigos, sin embargo, ella segu\u00eda trabajando y fortaleciendo su capital.  Hoy en d\u00eda ofrece mayor variedad de productos como lencer\u00eda, electrodom\u00e9sticos menores, ropa interior y queso que le traen cada 2 d\u00edas de su pueblo natal.  Solicita su primer cr\u00e9dito Kiva ya que pretende invertir en la compra de abanicos, ropa en general, paraguas, leche en polvo, arroz, entre otros art\u00edculos para satisfacer la demanda actual.

Vende principalmente a cr\u00e9dito, rotando su cartera 13 y 15 d\u00edas y compra tambi\u00e9n en varios almacenes de la ciudad semanalmente.

They came from the municipality of San Juan Nepomuceno, part of the county of Bolivar. \r\n\r\nWith the money she saved from her jobs, 10 years ago she decided to invest in the sale of clothes through a catalog, to sell to her neighbours and friends, however she kept working and strengthening her capital. Today she offers better variety of products, like lingerie, small household appliances, underwear and cheese that she gets every 2 days from her native town.\r\n\r\nShe requests her first loan with Kiva that she wants to use to buy fans, clothes in general, umbrellas, dried milk, rice and other products to satisfy the present day demands.\r\n\r\nDulcina broke up her relationship with her partner 2 years ago, however this situation filled her with courage and strength, she decided not to let herself be scared by the adversity and to stop working as a maid to have more time available to be able to focus all her attention to her family and business. \r\n\r\nSince then she travels periodically to Maicao, a city from the county of Guajira where she buys some of the items she sells. \r\n\r\nShe has gained many new customers because she's made herself known in her neighbourhood. Her sales are mostly on credit, charging customers every 13 to 15 days. She also buys new products weekly in various stores from her city.\r\n\r\nBeing 61 years old she is a very dynamic and active person, Her business is very well organised and she dreams with making it grow more so she can have a bigger profit margin than the one she has today of 40%.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own house in the neighbourhood of Santa Maria with one of her seven children, all of them adults.  Another of her dreams is to fix her house to improve her living conditions.

She is married to Benjamin, an auto mechanic, and a mother to her child, now in elementary school. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPerla operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighbourhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPerla hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to send her child all the way to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1117543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from rentals every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a loan of 50,000 PHP. She will be using the money to buy supplies like tiles, chlorine and for the maintenance of the private pool resort as well. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with her husband, Luis, and their daughter in the barrio of Chillogallo. Quito is the capital of Ecuador and also the second largest city. It is located on the slopes of the Andes mountain range and is 2,800 meters (9,180 feet) above sea level. Along with being the political capital, Quito is the country's cultural and financial center. The city is divided into three main sections: the historic center, where one can easily see how it was like during the colonial period; the north, traditionally home to the upper class; and the south, known as \"the poor side\" of the city. Elizabeth established her business five years ago in one of the city's wholesale markets, where she dedicates four hours every day to selling different fruits from Quito and the surrounding areas. After her work day ends, Elizabeth cares for her daughter. Of course, her daughter has grown up and doesn't need as much care as before, which is why Elizabeth wants to start working more every day. She is requesting the loan from Kiva to be able to purchase larger quantities of fruit and thus reduce the unit price. Furthermore, Elizabeth believes that working more hours and selling larger quantities is going to help her increase income, which would allow her to fulfill her dream of buying her own home for herself and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1117060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

mujeres Gladys, Ketty y Bertha. Ellas son amigas y conocidas de hace mucho tiempo, y hoy solicitan un cr\u00e9dito grupal de Kiva para cada una poder mejorar diferentes a\u00e9reas de sus negocios. Santo Domingo es una ciudad bastante grande, que se ubica pr\u00e1cticamente en el centro de Ecuador uniendo la Costa y la Sierra por una carretera que va desde el nivel del mar hasta los 2800 metros de altura. Debido a esto Santo Domingo se caracteriza por ser una ciudad de bastante comercio y trafico tur\u00edstico. Otro factor muy interesante es que por su ubicaci\u00f3n e importancia Santo Domingo se ha convertido en una de las ciudades m\u00e1s multiculturales del Ecuador. Todo esto convive bajo un clima h\u00famedo tropical a una altura de 200 metros.\nGladys tiene un peque\u00f1o puesto donde vende colas y aguas, este negocio es muy peque\u00f1o y no alcanza a cubrir las necesidades de Gladys y sus 4 hijos, por lo que el pr\u00e9stamo solicitado a trav\u00e9s de KIVA es muy importante para ella, le permitir\u00eda comprarse un congelador y adem\u00e1s comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda, si todo sale bien con esto Gladys podr\u00eda alg\u00fan d\u00eda cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser due\u00f1a de su propia tienda.\nKetty por otro lado, tiene un peque\u00f1o bazar y perfumer\u00eda. Ella necesita su pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertir en materiales para la venta como l\u00e1pices, libros, cuadernos etc. El sue\u00f1o de Ketty es ver a su hijo convertirse en un profesional, por lo que necesita producir m\u00e1s plata para poder pagar sus estudios de colegio y universidad eventualmente. Ketty trabaja alrededor de 6 horas diarias y su esposo tambi\u00e9n ayuda en la casa con su trabajo de mec\u00e1nico, pero Ketty necesita vender m\u00e1s para poder cubrir todos sus gastos.\nFinalmente tenemos a Bertha, ella es due\u00f1a de un puesto de venta de carnes asadas, Bertha tiene dos hijos en edad de escuela y tiene muchos sue\u00f1os, principalmente comprar su propia casa, ver a sus hijos convertirse en profesionales y ser due\u00f1a de su propio restaurante. Sin embargo el primer paso para ella es acceder a este pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertir en materia prima y mejorar sus ventas. \nTodas estas mujeres son ejemplos de madres. Para las tres ha resultado muy  dif\u00edcil acceder a cr\u00e9ditos ya que dos de ellas solo cuentan con estudios primarios y una con secundaria, ninguna asisti\u00f3 a la universidad y han tenido que ingeni\u00e1rselas y aprender en el acto para poder sobrevivir. Todas tienen ya por lo menos algunos a\u00f1os de experiencia con sus negocios y resulta fundamental poder adquirir sus pr\u00e9stamos para poder dar el siguiente paso y seguir creciendo, por su bien y el de su familia.\n","en":"Gladys, Ketty and Bertha are three women who live in the parish of Rio Verde in the city of Santo Domingo, Ecuador. They are friends and have known each other a long time, and they are requesting this group loan from Kiva so each can improve different areas of their businesses. Santo Domingo is a rather large city located in practically the center of Ecuador, with a highway running through it linking the coast with the mountains going from sea level to 2,800 meters (9,180 feet) above it. Because of this, Santo Domingo is known for being a rather commercial city with a lot of tourist traffic. Another very interesting item of note is that thanks to its location and importance the city has become one of the most multicultural in Ecuador. All of this coexists under a humid tropical climate 200 meters (650 feet) above sea level. Gladys has a small drink stand where she sells colas and water. This business is very small and it doesn't meet the needs of Gladys and her four children. Requesting this loan through Kiva is very important to her because it will allow her to purchase a freezer as well as more merchandise. If everything goes well, Gladys will be able to one day fulfill her dream of being owner of her own store. Ketty, on the other hand, has a small store and perfume shop. She is requesting the loan to invest in items to sell like pencils, books, notepads and other items. Her dream is to see her son become a professional, so she needs to earn more money to be able to eventually pay for his college education. Ketty works about six hours every day, and her husband, who is a mechanic, also helps out, but she needs to increase her sales in order to cover all of their expenses. Finally there is Bertha, who owns a stand selling grilled meats. She has two school-age children and has a lot of dreams, chiefly to buy her own home, see her children become professionals and to own a restaurant. Of course, the first step is to get this loan so she can be able to purchase supplies and increase her sales. All of these women are model mothers, but it has been difficult to receive a loan since two of them only have elementary-school educations, and the other a high-school education. None of them attended a university, and they all have had to make do and learn on the fly to get by. All of them now have at least a few years of experience with their businesses, and acquiring loans is essential to be able to take the next step and keep growing, for their own good as well as that of their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1117064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a freezer and buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1229.36,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":135.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":153.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":159.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":162.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":135.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":137.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334559},{"amount":147.49,"local_amount":145.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":147.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390483},{"amount":153.42,"local_amount":150.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149473},{"amount":155.89,"local_amount":153.32,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":155.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382597},{"amount":158.2,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":158.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989685},{"amount":162.64,"local_amount":159.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126095},{"amount":165.4,"local_amount":162.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":165.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516697},{"amount":169.37,"local_amount":166.57,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":169.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068561}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T13:39:00Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":437851,"name":"Perveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perveen is married and the mother of two daughters and two sons.

Her partner is Ronualdo and they have been together for three years and have a three-year-old son.  They live very happily in the house that they bought with their work savings and there they share the hope of obtaining a better level of life, full of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nCory works selling clothing items from different brands, styles, and sizes for all ages and for men as well as women.  In the same way, she sells shoes.  She renews all of her merchandise every 15 days or every month.  She orders it from another city through the help of a family member.  She has worked in this business for three years and began complementing it with the sale of feminine accessories like earrings, rings, and watches two months ago.  At times her sales have stalled because she has been unable to stock enough merchandise.  What she likes best about her work is the ease she has in finding new customers.  Her charisma and joy have allowed her to make good sales in short time and as such, the money she has earned as income is generated faster.  It also allows her to organize her time and do her household chores without neglecting her young son or her customers.  In the future, she hopes to obtain a storefront where she could open a small boutique to continue progressing.  \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support as it makes her feel more secure to advance in her work.  She promises, once again, to meet her payments punctually as she did with her past loans.  She is also very happy to belong to a communal bank as all of the members are very responsible and committed to each other.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she is requesting, she will buy a larger quantity of merchandise made up of clothing and undergarments for the summer season.  She will also invest in more feminine accessories (rings, watches, and necklaces) to complement her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1117099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, shoes, and feminine accessories to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T03:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cory","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":221.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":239.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":257.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":267.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":274.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.91,"local_amount":461.51,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401886},{"amount":91.64,"local_amount":239.06,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":245.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456160},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":115.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":118.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451827},{"amount":157.18,"local_amount":410.05,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":421.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447001},{"amount":1,"local_amount":2.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865307},{"amount":26.07,"local_amount":68.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":69.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905812},{"amount":71.24,"local_amount":185.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":191.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091916},{"amount":6.78,"local_amount":17.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-08T10:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":18.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778580}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T19:03:18Z","paid_date":"2014-02-08T10:00:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Ruby Waxham Blackwell","image":null}},{"id":437850,"name":"Erdenchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenchimeg lives with her 2 daughters in a ger (mongolian yurt) in the Govisumber province, Mongolia.

In her free time, Ofiyat likes to work with her hands - she sews traditional items and decorates them with gold thread embroidery. Her products are popular with brides and grooms and are also used as gifts at other festivities. Ofiyat's husband and son are also employed - they work at a factory that manufactures plastic frames for doors and windows. Everyone in the family works and shares in all expenses.\r\n\r\nOn advice of her friend who is also a client of MDO Arvand, LLC, Ofiyat turned to this organization for a loan to purchase livestock. Using that loan, she bought two sheep and fattened them over the course of several months. Having sold the sheep, Ofiyat spent her profits on an event for her son. Using the current loan, she would like to buy some jewelry for herself, as this has been a longtime dream of hers. She thanks MDO Arvand, LLC for their help and hopes to continue using their services."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1115213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofiyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":237.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":245.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":254.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":262.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":237.64,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397523},{"amount":55.28,"local_amount":245.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":263.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452359},{"amount":57.16,"local_amount":254.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":272.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212605},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":262.63,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":281.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443336}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T10:33:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:31:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":437869,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is from Samburu, Kenya.

Nevertheless, he has been working for possibly 10 years as a motorcycle taxi driver, and he devotes four to six hours a day to it.  While he does this, his partner helps him take care of the store.

Najminiso's daughter helps keep the home fires burning and works as a housekeeper for a family, while Najminiso works as a teacher in a local school. However, their salaries are not sufficient to improve their living conditions. Najminiso received this loan to carry out repairs in her home. No renovations have been done in the house for a long time, and the roof leaks after spring rains.

They don't have children yet, but she is 3 months pregnant and since she received this great news, her desires to progress and carve out a better living have gotten stronger because of the love that will come into her life.\r\n\r\nShe sells a variety of items and has a small store inside her home where she offers different groceries such as rice, milk, sugar, oil, eggs, potatoes and vegetables.  Her charisma and her cheerfulness are exactly the qualities needed to properly serve her customers.  She always smiles and speaks with kind words to everyone that visits her store.  She has worked at this job for about a year.  However, in order to succeed in starting her own store, she first had to struggle and save money for many months. \r\n\r\nShe had worked for 5 years selling wood, but because of the great physical strain required to work there, she chose to dedicate herself to her current work, which is a better option for her.  She works alone in her store while her partner works for himself in a trade.  He likes what he does because his income covers theirs expenses and provides them with peace and quiet to meet their basic needs.  Furthermore, because of Frank's work, Sandra doesn't need to worry and for now she can be content in her pregnancy.  She hopes to be able to build her business and eventually build a bigger store.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan from MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support and she will feel more secure to move ahead with her work.  She promises to comply with the payment terms and be punctual with payments.  She is satisfied with her community bank since all of its members are responsible and caring people.\r\n\r\nWith this loan (700 soles) she will buy more products for her store, such as rice, sugar, eggs, and other necessary items that she previous couldn\u2019t sell because she was not able to buy them due to a lack in capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1117118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, eggs, and other products for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T09:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T09:50:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":104.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":115.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":120.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":123},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":130.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.19,"local_amount":104.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099009},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":105.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":110.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401892},{"amount":45.49,"local_amount":115.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":122.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456166},{"amount":47.4,"local_amount":120.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":127.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451832},{"amount":48.32,"local_amount":123,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":129.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447007},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":130.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":137.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052912}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T14:10:50Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Connelly","image":1230042}},{"id":437609,"name":"Martha Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Martha esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con nosotros ya que tiene que pagar la inscripci\u00f3n de uno de sus hijos a la universidad.

The group's representative, Antoinette (who is raising her hand in the photo), is 46 years old and married to Anatole.  The couple have four children.  Some of their children attend school and all of them are still in their care.  Antoinette lives together with her husband and children.  The couple jointly cover their household expenses.  Antoinette herself did not attend school.  \r\n\r\nAntoinette has been selling fruit, 'akassa' (made from cornstarch) and local drinks from her home for a long time.  She stocks up at a market in Benin.  This is the second time that Antoinette and the other members of the ETERNEL group have requested a loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to strengthen their working capital, strengthen their businesses and better respond to their customer demand.  Their first loan was repaid

She has been married to Eduardo, age 67, for 40 years.  They have five children, who are now adults.  Her house is her own, and she got it as a wedding present.  She lives there with two minor grandchildren, whom she has been raising for some time.\r\n\r\nHer primary business activity consists of preparing various foods.  She has a gift for cooking, and she is well-known as one of the women who have the most exquisite tasting food in the city.  This is why her restaurant is one of the busiest in the area.  Her customers come daily to enjoy the delicious meals that she prepares with such care and affection.\r\n\r\nEver since she was very young she has had a passion for the culinary arts.  In time, she has been developing her capabilities and her senses in order to improve her seasoning.  She now knows how to do that, and she rapidly knows the best flavor for her customers\u2019 preferences.\r\n\r\nShe still remembers nostalgically, but with great pride, how she started in this work 20 years ago.  She dreamed of having her own restaurant.  With the passage of time, she has seen how her effort and constancy have produced the fruits of her labor and accomplishments that she is now able to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is preparing the food.  She enjoys the aromas, the flavors, and knowing that her loyal diners enjoy each dish.  That is why she does her work with a lot of love and dedication.  She does this, even though, at time she feels that she cannot please everyone as quickly as she would like to do.  This is because she sometimes works alone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with a little patience, a lot of respect, and a big smile she succeeds in making her customers happy and very satisfied with her restaurant.  She wants to continue with the improvement of the infrastructure of her restaurant.  She also wants to set the business up with some specific dishes.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She is grateful to the people who make this loan possible so that she can continue with her objectives.  She is very committed, once more, to making her payments punctually, as she did with the previous loans.  Also, she is very happy to belong to her communal bank because all of the members are very good, kind, and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy more ingredients that she uses daily to prepare her food because the demand has increased.  She will also get construction materials in order to improve the conditions of her place and to expand it a little more.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1117453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy the ingredients that she uses daily to prepare her food and to improve her place.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":295.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":319.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":318.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":343.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":356.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":366.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.61},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.67,"local_amount":295.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":296.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099011},{"amount":119.89,"local_amount":319.7,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":321.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401894},{"amount":119.42,"local_amount":318.46,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":320.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456168},{"amount":128.82,"local_amount":343.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":345.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451834},{"amount":133.61,"local_amount":356.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":358.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447009},{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":366.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":369.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052914}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T18:09:58Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":438005,"name":"Nino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nino is 48 years old.

She offers potential clients items such as colognes, cosmetics, underwear, and jewelry in an effort to make a contribution to the family income. Mar\u00eda's husband earns a living as a fisherman when he can, but often the fishing season is restricted, forcing him to find other types of work in order to meet the familiy's basic financial needs.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda plans to use this loan to finance the purchase of various catalogue products. She has already collected the orders from clients in her community. All she requires now is the working capital with which to purchase the items she intends to sell. In order to make these purchases, Mar\u00eda must travel by boat to Puntarenas, across the Nicoya Gulf, which takes about two hours each way. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a hard-working, ambitious entrepreneur. She organizes her day in order to optimize her productivity. In the mornings, she carries out the domestic tasks at home and sends her daughter to school. When Mar\u00eda travels to Puntarenas, she wakes up at 4 a.m. because the boat leaves at 6 a.m. and the walk from her home to where the boat leaves is long. In the afternoons, she visits her clients and collects orders. At night, Mar\u00eda attends night school, where she is in the process of completing her high school certificate.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's goals are to increase her client base and to gain clients in all parts of the Isla de Chira, the island where she lives. She hopes to be able to finance the studies of her daughter in the future. Mar\u00eda says her main obstacle is the competition she faces from other vendors. She doesn't let this deter her, though, because she says \u00a8there is sufficient diversity in products.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":572699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

","en":"Carmen is 28 years old.  She is a modest, optimistic and very hard-working woman.  She has a 6-year-old daughter called Milena and she works hard every day in order to provide her with a better quality of life.  The family currently live in their own home which they acquired through a lot of hard work and commitment.  There they share their happy days and sad days, as a united family.\r\n\r\nCarmen's business is selling spare parts and accessories for all kinds of vehicles but mainly motorcycle taxis.  She also services and repairs these vehicles.  Thanks to the excellent quality of her work, she is considered one of the best in her field and has become one of the best-known mechanics in the city, an honor she shares with her husband who has been working alongside her since she opened the business 18 months ago.  The couple have a lot of customers which provides them with security and financial stability.  They carry out their work in premises that they rent.  At first things were a little difficult owing to the fear and doubts that they had but they remained undaunted and now they continue wanting to grow their business.  What Carmen most enjoys about her work is seeing that her customers are happy when they find their cars in good condition and working well.  She is familiar with this feeling of satisfaction because she has two motorcycle taxis of her own which she hires out for transporting passengers.  Her goal is to acquire larger premises so that she can provide her customers with a better service and to have a larger quantity of different brands of spare parts both to sell and to use in her repair work.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's fifth loan from MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that is being placed in her with this loan.

Y a pesar de que trabaja d\u00eda y noche, tambi\u00e9n vende repuestos y accesorios de veh\u00edculos (llantas, rodajes y otras piezas), las ofrece de manera casual y vende por pedidos.

Currently, he is separated from the woman he had been with for a year and with whom he had a daughter, who is now 1 year and 2 months.  He lives in a house that he rents and works a lot everyday to improve his financial situation and to be able to offer his daughter a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis work consists of providing local urban transportation services.  He has worked at this for 13 years in the car that his friend lends him.  He drives around the streets of the city with the goal of looking for passengers, and thanks to his skills as a good conversationalist and because of his joyful spirit, he has loyal customers who call him for his service.  In addition, he knows the streets, avenues, and alleys of the city.  Although he works day and night, he also sells spare parts and car accessories (rims, rotors, and others).  He offers them casually and sells by the order.  He has also found this side business to be profitable and with the development of both, he hopes to settle in the field of transportation.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is knowing that he has the opportunity to advance and he feels grateful that people trust in him.  He really enjoys driving the city streets, even though on occasions, he has had to face inconsiderate passengers who haven't wanted to pay him the fair price.  Still, he knows that this is part of his job and he has to carry on.  He hopes that in the future he will be able to purchase his own car and establish a shop selling car parts, spares, and accessories.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is content knowing that he has financial support, since this makes him feel more secure to advance with his job.  Likewise, he promises once again to complete his payments punctually, as he has done with the previous loans.  Moreover, he is happy to belong to his community bank, since all of the members are very responsible and supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the amount requested (S\/.1500) in the repair of the vehicle he uses for work and also in some parts to sell (rims, rotors, axes, ball joints, shocks and other parts)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1117456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair the car he uses for work and to purchase spare parts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":239.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":238.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":257.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":267.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":275.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.66,"local_amount":460.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":473.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401895},{"amount":91.49,"local_amount":238.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":245.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456169},{"amount":98.7,"local_amount":257.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":264.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451835},{"amount":102.38,"local_amount":267.07,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":274.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447010},{"amount":105.77,"local_amount":275.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":283.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052915}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T22:15:30Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":438048,"name":"Bibiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de venta de verduras y frutas,la socia vende manzanas,naranjas,platanos y uvas y tambien la socia vende zanahorias,tomates,lechugas y zapallos,la socia vende desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 6:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio la socia quiere salir adelante,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de venta de fruta y verduras.La socia solicita el credito para comprar zanahorias,tomates y zapallos y tambien para comprar frutas como manzanas,naranjas,uvas y platanos.\n\n La socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"Bibiana is continuing with her business selling fruits and vegetables.

He lives at home with his parents and wife Mariela, 18, and their two beloved children: 3-year-old Ken and 1-year-old Andrea. He has been working very hard every day on their behalf so that he can provide them with better circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor five years, he has been buying and selling fresh fish, working with three co-workers who help him select, transport, and sell the fish. He has been able to comfortably maintain his family and provide for theirs needs this way. His constant desire to succeed led him to undertake this business, and little by little he has become well known for selling the freshest, most delicious fish in the market and always greeting his customers with a smile. He also rents out a motorcar, which is an additional source of income, and he occasionally drives in the afternoons. At first he found it difficult to adapt to the routine because he didn't understand the business well, but over time he has begun to find his footing. \r\n\r\nConversing with his customers is what he likes most about his job; the most difficult aspect of it is putting up with the intense odor that remains on his clothes and skin. He hopes that he will one day have an air conditioned vehicle to transport and store his fresh products for longer periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan cycle with MFP, and he is grateful for the opportunities and confidence the institution places in him. For his part, he promises to make his payments promptly. He also is happy to belong to his communal bank, as he regards its members as responsible and caring people. He will use the requested loan amount (S\/.2000) to buy more varieties and sizes of fish. He will also do maintenance on his vehicle, buying some parts and paying the mechanic who will do the work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1117463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more varieties and sizes of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gustavo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":295.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":319.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":318.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":343.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":356.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":366.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.61},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.67,"local_amount":295.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":296.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099012},{"amount":119.89,"local_amount":319.7,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":321.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401897},{"amount":119.42,"local_amount":318.46,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":320.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456171},{"amount":128.82,"local_amount":343.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":345.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451837},{"amount":133.61,"local_amount":356.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":358.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447012},{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":366.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":369.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052917}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T17:58:44Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":438231,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past year Elsie, a 29-year-old married mother of three, has been running a small business selling BBQ in her community.

She is a kind and friendly woman who works hard so that she can provide a better quality of life for her young son who is 2 years and 8 months old.  Margarita lives in her parents' house as she is in the process of buying her own home.\r\n\r\nMargarita's business is renting out a car.  Thanks to the enthusiam that she has always shown in her work and the personal desire she has to improve herself, she has worked in a number of different businesses and, in every one, she managed to save up money.  She used her savings to buy her first vehicle which is now used as a taxi.  Margarita has been in her business for a little over three years and, thanks to this, her income has improved and she has been able to cover some needs that her household face.\r\n\r\nWhat Margarita most enjoys about her work, as a vehicle owner, is that it allows her to travel constantly and enjoy the landscape of her area.  The most difficult part of her work is having to get up early in the morning in order to meet the morning rush hour demand.  She knows that her work is hard but she also knows that, in the shorter term, she will receive rewards from her hard work.  In the future, Margarita hopes to buy another car and to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is Margarita's seventh loan from MFP.

A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in to receive as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She also sells snack food for additional income. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.\r\n  \r\nVicky dreams to be able to give her child a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1118328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

The climate in the canton is subtropical due to its moderately high altitude, in contrast to the climate of the province\u2019s highlands between the Western and Central Cordilleras.  The canton is divided into two parishes: the urban parish of San Miguel de los Bancos and the rural parish of Mindo.  As in the other cantons in Pichincha province, the economy of Los Bancos is mainly agricultural, and is mostly based on raising livestock.  However, there has recently been considerable growth in ecotourism, especially in Mindo.\r\n\r\nVinicio is a resident of this beautiful canton.  He is a 41-year-old entrepreneur who has spent his life working in the field and feels very much at home there.  Vinicio is a native of Loja, but he decided to come to Los Bancos a little over 15 years ago to start his cattle business.  He lives alone, and has an 18-year-old son who no longer lives with him.  Vinicio works on his land about 12 hours a day caring for his cattle and maintaining his property.  In his free time he enjoys playing sports to stay healthy; he also enjoys going out in the surrounding area and admiring the beauty of the ecosystem and the vegetation there.  Vinicio is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, an institution that manages funds from Kiva and provides them to local entrepreneurs.  Vinicio\u2019s goal is to increase the number of cattle he has on his property and thus increase his agricultural production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1117899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase more cattle to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T02:00:56Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T02:00:54Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cosme Vinicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.75,"local_amount":71.23,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":71.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334561},{"amount":82.54,"local_amount":81.94,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390485},{"amount":84.14,"local_amount":83.53,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149475},{"amount":86.3,"local_amount":85.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382599},{"amount":87.44,"local_amount":86.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989687},{"amount":89.55,"local_amount":88.9,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":89.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126096},{"amount":90.87,"local_amount":90.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":90.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516698},{"amount":92.63,"local_amount":91.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":92.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068562},{"amount":389.78,"local_amount":386.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":389.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494837}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T15:42:41Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":438103,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer joven, amable y muy trabajadora.

Over time, she hopes to get the money together to be able to have a warehouse that would allow her to maintain her current customer base and at the same time to increase the quantity and variety of goods from what she currently sells.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth credit with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has a financial support, since this makes her feel more secure in advancing her business prospects.

Tienen cuatro hijos, de los cuales dos de ellos son menores de edad, tienen 17 y 10 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1n en etapa escolar y dependen aun de lo que Zoila y Jorge. Viven en su casa propia, la que consiguieron con mucho esfuerzo y toda la familia pone mucho empe\u00f1o para seguir adelante. \n\nSu negocio es la venta de comida, ella misma se encarga de la preparaci\u00f3n de sabrosos potajes regionales, la clientela es atra\u00edda a su puesto por el inigualable aroma y el agradable sabor de sus comidas. Vende en la vereda de su casa, que est\u00e1 ubicada en un sector muy concurrido, aunque solo realiza este trabajo por las noches, ha visto que le genera buenos ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Se inici\u00f3 en este rubro hace 40 a\u00f1os, ya que desde muy ni\u00f1a ayudaba en la cocina y participaba en la preparaci\u00f3n de los alimentos al lado de su madre, oficio que tambi\u00e9n ella realizaba de manera ambulatoria. Este negocio le ha dado el dinero necesario para alimentar a sus hijas y pagarles sus estudios, pero siente que m\u00e1s adelante va a tener m\u00e1s gastos y el dinero le va a faltar, por eso desea tener un restaurante en su casa, donde pueda vender con mayor comodidad. Por otra parte, durante el d\u00eda, quiere incursionar en la venta de repuestos de moto, ya que ha visto por el trabajo que realizan sus hijos mayores que esta actividad tambi\u00e9n genera buenas ganancias; con ambos trabajos busca consolidar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Zoila disfruta mucho de su actividad, m\u00e1s a\u00fan adora ver a sus comensales contentos, pues le agrada conversar con sus clientes mientras disfrutan de sus platillos. Algunas veces se le hace muy dif\u00edcil atender a todas las personas que concurren a su puesto, a pesar de eso no decae en su af\u00e1n de salir adelante.\n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 6 con MFP, por tanto agradece la oportunidad y confianza que ponen en ella. Por otro lado, se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de manera puntual. Y le agrada ser parte del banco comunal al que pertenece, ya que ha visto que sus integrantes son personas responsables y solidarias.\n\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 3500) comprar\u00e1 ingredientes y algunos insumos que necesita para continuar con la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, invertir\u00e1 en materiales de construcci\u00f3n para acondicionar un peque\u00f1o local para la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes.

She lives with Jorge who is 50 years old and who has been her partner for 35 years. They have four children of whom two are minors, 17 and 10 years old. They are of school-age and remain dependent on Zoila and Jorge. They live in their own house, which they obtained with a lot of hard work, and their family is determined to get ahead. \r\n\r\nHe business is food sales. She herself is in charge of preparing delicious regional stews. Her customers are attracted to her stall because of the unbeatable aroma and delicious flavour of her foods. She sells on the sidewalk in front of her house, which is located in a very busy area, although she only carries out this work at night. She has seen that she makes a good income from this business. \r\n\r\nShe started working like this 40 years ago, as since she was a young girl she helped in the kitchen and with the preparation of food at her mother\u2019s side, something she also did as a mobile-vendor. This business has given her to money necessary to feed her girls and pay their studies. However she feels that further down the track she will have more expenses and she will not have enough money to cover them. For this reason she wants to start a restaurant in her house, where she can sell more comfortably.\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, during the day she wants to start selling spare motorcycle parts, since she has seen from the work her older children carry out that this generates a good income. With both business she hopes to consolidate her income. \r\n\r\nZoila enjoys this work very much, and loves even more to see her diners happy, since she she likes to chat with her clients whilst they enjoy her dishes. Sometimes she finds it difficult to serve all the people who attend her stall. Despite this she does not falter in her eagerness to get ahead. \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth credit with MFP, and for this reason she is thankful for the opportunity and confidence it inspires in her. On the otherhand she promises to make repayments punctually. She is grateful to be part of the communal bank of which she is a member, since she has seen that its members are responsible and there is solidarity amongst them. With the amount she is asking for (S\/.3500) she will buy ingredients and some supplies she needs to continue with the preparation of her foods. She will also invest in some construction materials to air-condition a small restaurant-premises for the service of her clients. She will also invest part of the sum in the purchase of spare motorcycle parts. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1117972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients and some supplies for food preparation and the construction of a restaurant premises for her business.

He is married and the father to a son who is in his care.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to having his degree in systems engineering, he has owned an internet cafe in his community for a year, where he has gotten experience and knowledge.  He started this business when the old owner of the internet cafe decided to sell the business at a favorable price.  Elvin saw the opportunity to become independent and have his own business, so he found support from financial institutions to purchase the business with the hope of having a business and being able to get ahead.  This has been his first business that he has shared with his wife, who helps with the administration of the internet cafe.  He also has other income since he receives money from relatives who are outside of the country.  He is happy with the place he has found himself, since he has no competition in the area and has a fixed customer base.  \r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan to purchase spare parts for the computers, such as mouses, monitors, keyboards, and more.  This loan will help because he can perform maintenance on his machines to offer better service to his customers.  His future plans are to open a second business, which will be a bookstore, to purchase other computers for faster service, and to remodel the internet cafe for a better presentation of the business.  He hopes to own his own home to avoid the costs of renting, and to have a stable business that generates more income so that he can get ahead with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1117977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase computer accessories such as mouses, monitors, and keyboards.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvin Marin \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-20T08:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613467},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452939},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448987},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443848}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T21:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":438130,"name":"Oscar Ovidio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar, se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol y a la crianza de ganado, vive con su esposa y tres hijos de 8,10, y 12 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 dedicado a la actividad agropecuaria desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las seis de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las tres de la tarde.\nEl est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para poder realizar la compra de abono y herbicidas, que son los necesario para iniciar el cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, esto le ayudar\u00e1 a tener una siembra libre de plagas y poder ayudar de una mejor manera a su familia.\nSu objetivo es desarrollarse como agricultor y crecer en la ganader\u00eda, ya que esto le ayudar\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n a su familia y a sus hijos para que sientan el apoyo econ\u00f3mico y puedan superarse en sus estudios\n","en":"Oscar, who works cultivating corn and beans and raising cattle, lives with his wife and their three children, who are 8, 10, and 12 years old.

She lives in one of the neighborhoods in the town of Nueva Frontera, Santa Barbar\u00e1. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Dolores has been selling merchandise for 10 years.  She started her business in order to generate her own income since she was not receiving financial support from the father of her children.  Do\u00f1a Dolores sells merchandise as a street vendor by visiting various communities in the surrounding areas where she has established customers.  She sells clothes such as trousers, blouses, and shirts, but she also sells food products in bulk, such as peanuts and instant soup packets.  Dolores restocks her business by going to different communities.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 12,000 HNL so that she can invest in the purchase of clothing and peanuts.  This investment will increase her operating capital and help her generate better earnings.  She will also have the necessary products to sell and to offer to the grocery stores.  Dolores hopes in the future to obtain enough capital to buy a vehicle, which will enable her to travel around more easily as she continues to sell her products.

She is separated from her husband and has a 15-month old son.  He is why she works hard-to offer him a comfortable life and a good education.  She lives in her mother\u2019s house and she and her mother work together to get ahead.\r\nShe sells clothing, household items and gas twice a month or monthly.   Her mother helps her by buying the used clothing, pots, bowls, trays, mops, fuel and other articles that she then sells in areas far away from her home city.  She sells mostly in villages or in remote areas where the people can\u2019t get to the city because of the distance and the cost. She travels by river and her trips can last up to 8 hours before she arrives at her destination.  She carries a lot of varied merchandise that give her a good income.  Sometimes she triples her initial investment.  Dalia has been in this business for about 2 years and when she is home in the city, she sells perfumes through a catalog.\r\nShe likes what she does because she can make her own money and carry the household expenses.  It also allows her to manage her own time and to be able to care for her son, who is at that age where he needs a lot of attention.\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she appreciates the opportunity and confidence given her.  For her part she promises to make the payments on time and she is grateful to be a part of the communal bank since its members are responsible and supportive.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1118040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for this month of regional celebrations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":294.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":318.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":332.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":355.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":367.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.35,"local_amount":294.27,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":295.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099015},{"amount":119.56,"local_amount":318.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":319.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401906},{"amount":124.01,"local_amount":330.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":331.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456180},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":334.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451846},{"amount":133.29,"local_amount":355.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":356.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447021},{"amount":137.92,"local_amount":367.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":369.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052926}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T19:21:12Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":437892,"name":"Pc 1 Kielle Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce banc villageois a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e depuis son inauguration .\n\nIl est compos\u00e9 de femmes qui habitent le m\u00eame  village et se partagent des valeurs sociales communes.\n \nLes membres qui le fondent s'activent toutes dans le commerce.\n\nMadame Alassane est une femme  mari\u00e9e \u00e2g\u00e9e de 37 ans et m\u00e8re de 7 enfants dont 6 filles et 1 gar\u00e7on.\n\nAlassane est debout \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame droite de la photo et habill\u00e9 en robe et foulard multicolore.\n\nElle s'active dans le commerce par la vente de l\u00e9gumes et de produits d\u00e9tergents.\n\nAlassane fait cette activit\u00e9 depuis son adh\u00e9sion au Banc Villageois.

She lives in her own home, which she was able to acquire recently with the support of her partner, and they are very happy as a result.  \r\n\r\nHer work consists of selling groceries, for which she must purchase the products--that she sells from the store she has set up in her home--at wholesale prices on a weekly basis.  Her clientele comes to her with the surety that in her store they will find every that is necessary for preparing meals, such as bread, milk, eggs, oil, rice, beans, and others.  In the same way, just in the past few days she has set up a section for accessories and hardware products, since she has seen that in the area where she lives there is a lot of demand for such items.  All of her customers are treated with much respect, care and with the joy that characterizes Gaby's youthful exuberance.  \r\n\r\nGaby began by selling just plantains and eggs that she would set up on a table in front of her house, and little by little kept on growing, and now she has been in the business for over 2 years.  She is open 24 hours a day and since she began this business she has worked alone, and she feels very peaceful and happy.  What she likes most in her work is the satisfaction of seeing her customers come back happy to have found in her store everything they need.  This small business has given her independence and general economic solvency to be able to manage the costs coming from feeding her children, watching after their health, and sending them to school.  She hopes to increase the size of her store, stock it with a greater diversity of products and keep the customers that she has been able to attract up until now.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, since as a result she will feel more secure as she moves forward with her work.  She is also committed to following through with her payments in a punctual manner.  She also feels satisfied belonging to her cooperative bank, since all of its members are very responsible and socially conscious.
