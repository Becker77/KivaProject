In  the vicinity there are interesting archaeological ruins and the city itself retains remarkable baroque buildings from the colonial era, such as the convent of Carmen, among other tourist attractions the city owns.  On this occasion we can see in the photograph the members with some of their children who accompany them to the meetings of the communal bank.  \r\n\r\nGloria, 32, was married a number of years ago, and conceived 4 children, the second of whom died in an accident at the age of 11.  Of the other children the oldest is 15 years old, and as he does not like to study he remains in the home.  Another is 11 and studies in a local school, and the youngest, who is 3, stays with her.  They do not yet have their own home, so they live in a rented home in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThis member has a good friendship with all the other members of the small bank, and she joined the group thanks to her sister who already belonged to the bank.  Now the group is in its 2nd loan cycle.  She delivers colas, potato chips, Cheetos, yucca chips, and everything from the Frito Lay and Pepsi brands along with her husband, who drives his own truck.  They have been in this line of work for 10 years.  With the new loan they will pay expenses related to the maintenance of the vehicle, such as expenses for oil changes, tires, and other maintenance.  Her dream is to eventually come to own her own house.\r\n\r\nFlor Ch\u00e1vez, 19, is one of the youngest members of the bank.  She lives in the center of the city of Cuenca and she lives in a common-law marriage with her partner who works in a car dealership.  She is in her 6th month of pregnancy, and they do not have their own home so they rent. \r\n\r\nFlor sells clothing door to door.  She does not have a fixed schedule and she works each day without resting even one day.  She tells us that she started with the business thanks to the first loan that she took from the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She also tells us that thanks to her mother-in-law and brother-in-law she is now a member of this beautiful group of enterprising and go-getting women.  Now that the group is in its second cycle she will take a loan to buy pants, blouses, shirts, bags, underwear, socks, etc. for the whole family.  Her goal is to grow her business and at some point have her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":516727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for expenses related to vehicle maintenance such as oil change, tires; to acquire pants, shirts, blouses, bags, underwear, and socks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Carmen Brecilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mayra Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2475,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":928.14,"local_amount":928.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":928.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674828},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709008},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709009},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892305},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892306},{"amount":309.34,"local_amount":309.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":309.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632680}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T22:53:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":194208,"name":"Wifridah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wifridah O.

They average 39 years of age and have an average of five children each. They all live in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbours and marriage. This group of women trade in fodder (food for livestock), tomatoes, children's clothing and calabashes (vines which can be dried out to be used as bottles or utensils). With a view to increase their businesses, they decided to work together with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fourth group loan. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 who buys and sells decorative articles is planning to use her loan to buy 200 calabashes. She gets her supply of calabashes in Tona and Konodimini. The calabashes are peeled and engraved with small figures or designs made out materials which have been traditionally designed for this purpose. They are resold to order to newly married couples, sometimes on a door-to-door basis in the various neighborhoods, and the customer base is made up of women and men. Mrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 hopes, along with the other members of the group, to make an average monthly profit of 27,500FCFA part of which will be invested in their businesses and part for their savings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":534908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase calabashes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dado       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e9t\u00e9    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779292},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961508},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699628},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913515},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180680},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476648}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T17:14:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":202403,"name":"Sharon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharon B., 24 years old, is from the village of Capayangan, Banisilan, South Cotabato.

 esta experiencia fue significativa en su vida y le dio la firmeza,  para iniciar su propia iniciativa de negocio que hoy lleva por nombre  llamada \u201cTienda MAFE\u201d con la cual se independiz\u00f3 a los 20 a\u00f1os y que  ha logrado estabilizar, desde antes de cumplir sus actuales 27 a\u00f1os de edad.

When he was just 12 years old, not even finishing high school yet, he started working as an employee in a store.  This experience was significant in his life in that it made him determined to start his own business which today is called \u201cTienda MAFE\u201d with which he became independent at the age of 20 and which he has managed to stabilize before his present age of 27.\r\n\r\nHe has faced several challenges in his store like when many customers who had taken items on credit didn\u2019t pay him.  However, this did not discourage him and he continued forward just being more careful about choosing customers when credit was the issue.  Now his sales on credit are very few; he sells almost his entire stock of merchandise for cash.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another he was also a victim of holdups but with help from his parents he continued toward his goal of stabilizing the business always counting on help from his sister who is his right hand.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy merchandise like: foodstuffs, snacks, beverages and the usual items that go into a family\u2019s daily needs.  He will also use it to pay debts he has with his suppliers and gain the discounts offered for cash purchases.\r\n\r\nHis ideal is to own his house because he currently rents.  His greatest challenge is a lack of credit history that makes him ineligible for loans from financial institutions.  This is why he\u2019s called upon the Fundaci\u00f3n to undergo his first experience with financing;  he hopes to grow alongside it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":608531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock items for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":178239},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":186766},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":190346},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":193994},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":197712},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":201502},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":205364},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209300},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":213311},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":223466}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.06},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.73},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.99},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.26,"local_amount":178239,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":181389.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550755},{"amount":105.06,"local_amount":186766,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":190067.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688363},{"amount":107.06,"local_amount":190346,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":193710.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427584},{"amount":109.13,"local_amount":193994,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":197422.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001003},{"amount":111.21,"local_amount":197712,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":201206.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289010},{"amount":113.34,"local_amount":201502,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":205063.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157164},{"amount":115.52,"local_amount":205364,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":208993.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230171},{"amount":117.73,"local_amount":209300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":212999.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509044},{"amount":119.99,"local_amount":213311,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":217081.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673275},{"amount":125.7,"local_amount":223466,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":227415.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319836}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T03:03:26Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":239280,"name":"Norah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norah is 51 years old.

Over the next five years, Norah plans to have at least four good dairy cows and, if possible, to build a permanent business facility in her town.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":619518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T16:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576778},{"amount":125,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450350},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872444},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030348},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668414},{"amount":125,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535880},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221857591},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227073869},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"payment_id":232834840},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238834242}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T17:59:02Z","paid_date":"2011-11-16T09:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":243379,"name":"Namsrai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Namsrai H. is 37 years old and lives with his family in a ger (Mongolian nomadic dwelling) in the Songinohairhan District of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

She has been a private school teacher for many years and during afternoons manufactures scale models of the human body (made with putty and modeling clay attached to Tecnopor or wood) that are used for educational displays.  These might be the respiratory system or the nervous system as well as mathematical teaching aids.  She enjoys her work very much since during these two years she has acquired quite a bit of ability and manual dexterity so that she finishes her models on time with little effort.\r\n\r\nWhat motivates her to dedicate herself to this work is the good profits she earns on each project.  Because of this she\u2019d like to set up a bookstore where she can also sell this type of crafts.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan with MFP and she pledges to repay on time because she wants to count on having future help that will make it possible for her to continue progressing.\r\n\r\nIf she were to get the loan she\u2019s requesting, she will invest it in purchasing acrylic paints and Tecnopor (a brand of polystyrene) in large amounts to continue making her scale models.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":699745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":" To buy acrylic paints and Tecnopor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":150.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":159.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":162.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":169.69},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.55,"local_amount":150.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":156.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887242},{"amount":59.67,"local_amount":159.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327602},{"amount":60.85,"local_amount":162.26,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196138},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":169.69,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":176.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269814},{"amount":65.81,"local_amount":175.51,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":182.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549836},{"amount":68.48,"local_amount":182.61,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":189.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718482}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T23:09:31Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":272061,"name":"San Isidro Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Women Entrepreneurs Committee of the City of Villa Hayes, Chaco Remancito.

She is from Bani Kenanah, an impoverished community in Irbid, Jordan, and comes from a comparatively small family of four girls. Omayma and her sisters were raised by her mother and grandmother. Omayma and her mother and sisters were abandoned by their father when they were all young so they moved into their mother\u2019s family home where they were raised by \u201ca village\u201d of extended family.  Even so, they could not escape the poverty that would not allow them to get an education. Realizing that not being educated would handicap her daughters, Omayma\u2019s mother stepped in and taught her girls how to sew and embroider women\u2019s clothing. Omayma found her passion \u2013 she loves to sew.\r\n\r\nAfter her first year of marriage, Omayma gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Sine then, her family has grown to include two more daughters \u2013 all loved and cherished by their doting mother. Omayma has never lost her love for creating women\u2019s fashion and has established a small business from her home to enable her to work and raise her daughters at the same time.  \r\n\r\nOmayma envisions her creations long before each item takes its finA. form. She starts creating a new piece of clothing by first imagining how it will look, then drawing a picture of the dress and asking one of her friends to model while she drapes and pins the materiA. to bring her design to life. From there, Omayma sews the pieces together and finishes it with ornate embroidery. Omayma has gradually built a clientele from the members of her immediate community and she is developing a reputation for her beautiful designs that extends beyond Irbid. \r\n\r\nOmayma is requesting a loan of 400 JOD to purchase a modern sewing machine, storage boxes to organize her supplies, and hanging display racks to best display her creations.\r\n\r\nAs Omayma can imagine a new design, she can also dream big \u2013 she dreams of expanding her project throughout the Kingdom and making a name for herself. She hopes to increase her clientele and her income. Someday, Omayma would like to be able to give her daughters an opportunity to carry on the family business or feel the freedom to pursue their own dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":817437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Her oldest is in school. Her husband has an electronics workshop.\r\n\r\nShe is a housewife who is also a saleswoman. She sells products from Avon and Sayson catalogs (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume and women's accessories). She works two or three hours every day, although it's hard for her to make door-to-door sales because she has to take her two youngest with her since she doesn't have anywhere to leave them. She sells items on credit and collects payments every 8 days. She has been doing this for 8 years and it's going very well. Her most popular products are perfumes and cosmetics because they're very good.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan for perfumes, creams, cosmetics and jewelry.

is a 25-year-old who makes <i>huipiles<\/i> for her livelihood. <i>Huipiles<\/i> are wonderful handmade blouses worn by the Mayan women in the highlands of Guatemala. She will buy the hand-woven material from other women in her village and then hand embroider flowers and through out the blouse. Her technique of embroidering these fabrics is highly specialized and different from that of her neighbors \u2013 she actually apprenticed to another master embroiderer to learn the technique.\r\n<p>\r\nThe current piece she is creating incorporates 33 different Mayan symbols which are called hieroglyphs. The Maya hieroglyphics were the writing system of the pre-Columbian civilization. It will take her 15 days to create the exquisite finished blouse and  she will sell it for about US$85. She also makes a less expensive blouse that has embroidered flowers throughout the top part of the blouse and sells for about $35. \r\n<p>\r\nKelin is married and has a 3-year-old. Her husband works in the fields. Her biggest goal, which she is passionate about, is to ensure that her child must receive an education to become a professional, escaping the limited opportunities her husband endures. \r\n<p>\r\nHer health is not good and like so many other women and children in her village, she suffers from many ailments during the six-month rainy season. Malnutrition is a factor in this community. The women all breast feed and most of the children under two years old are underweight and therefore get hit the hardest with illness. Many of the women are looking for resources to obtain vitamins for their babies.\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a video of the women of Kelin's group at their loan meeting.

Makeni, a town in Northern Sierra Leone. The school serves a total of 805 students (338 boys, 467 girls) and employs 23 teachers. In operation for 12 years, it receives a small annual stipend from the government to help cover its operating costs (very few schools in Sierra Leone are funded exclusively by the government). The school reports many successes, including the fact that the external (national) exam scores for their pupils have been steadily increasing thanks in large part to the teachers' hard work. For many of the teachers here, however, life can be a struggle. The school has fallen into disrepair, and there are no funds available to build additional classrooms, repair walls, replace broken desks, or make other necessary adjustments. Furthermore, many teachers' salaries are long overdue, with some that have waited over two years to receive a paycheck. Many teachers engage in side-projects and small businesses in order to supplement (or in some cases replace) their salaries, and Khulafai's teachers are collectively seeking a loan of SLL 11 million from SMT and Kiva Lenders.<p>\r\n\r\nMomodu K. (pictured second from right, back row) is a senior teacher at the school and has taken on the role of group leader. Momodu is 46 years old and has been teaching young children for 25 years. He is married to a petty trader, and together they have eight children (three boys and five girls). Five of Momodu's children attend school and three are not yet old enough. Some time ago, he purchased a plot of land on which he dreamed of building a house for his family because he believes that \"once you own a home, you have something for which you and your family can be proud.\" He plans to use his portion of the funds to finance the purchase of some materials so that he can begin construction.

She believes that insurance is very important and necessary, because no one is completely immune from accidents on the job or in the streets.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":485075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987611},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713640},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":225.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746687},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929844},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159669013},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172149941}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T23:16:10Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

36 years old, married and has two children.  She has been partnering with our organization since 2008.  She has a secondary education.  After graduating from school, Sharafniso started working with her mother and then got married several years later.  She stayed home for a few years and took care of the children.  Then, her relative offered her a salesperson job at a store eight years ago.  After working for one year, she decided to start her own business.  Her husband supported her decision, and now she has her own business.  Sharafniso has been selling at her district market for over five years.

She has worked as a teacher at Ceta INATEC Nueva Guinea for 5 years.  She is requesting her 7th loan from Kiva partner AFODENIC so she can improve her home by repairing the floor and repairing the roof a bit, which is in bad condition.  She will buy construction materials with this loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He will use his loan money to buy groceries such as noodles, sugar and rice with which to stock his store.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Javier has worked with loans from Emprender.

She is a single mother of five children between the ages of 12 and 26.  Three of the children go to school.  Isabel did not have the opportunity to study because her father gave priority to his sons, saying the daughters had to work on the machamba (small family farm).  She lives in her own house with her family and supports her mother by sending her money for food.\r\n\r\nIsabel left Gaza to move to Namaacha District when her father was transferred to work at the Namaacha Water company.  After her arrival, Isabel began selling contraband products (mukero), but the work was very risky, so she began a new business selling sacks of peanuts and beans. She buys them in Swaziland and resells them in the capital city.  She makes three trips per month, buying 20 sacks on each trip, 10 of beans at 1,620 meticais each and 10 of peanuts at 1,800 meticais each.  She then resells them at 1,950 meticais and 2,250 meticais respectively.  She makes a profit of about 10,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's fourth loan with Hluvuku.  She is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy products (beans, peanuts and other items) to increase the volume of her business.  The previous loans were for 5,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will pay off the loan ahead of schedule, and she will ask for another loan to buy a vehicle that would make it easier for her to sell her products in the capital.\r\n\r\n

She lives in Prk. Mubentanyo, Brgy. Dungga, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. \r\n\r\n<p>Cecelia now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. She is now borrowing PHP 13,000 in order to purchase more stock for the general store.  This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cecelia hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Recalls Susana, \u201cI thought - I want to be a childcare provider! This is what I want to do. This is the job for me.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith gusto and determination Susana enrolled in community college, earning her degree in Child Development and passing all of her classes with flying colors\u2014quite a feat, considering she had only attended school through the sixth grade. \r\n\r\nShortly after completing her education, she opened up a daycare center in her own home and named it\u2014fittingly enough\u2014\"Happy Faces\". Fourteen gleeful children, ranging from 20 months to five years old, come to Happy Faces Daycare Monday through Friday to sing the alphabet, learn their manners, and play games outside. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to teach manners starting at a young age. You can be sure that all of my children [clients] know how to say \u2018please\u2019, how to share, and how to wait their turn.\u201d\r\n\r\nSusana has no problem ensuring happy faces on her clients. In fact, she maintains such a happy clientele that she didn\u2019t lose anyone during the recession (when many parents lost their jobs and no longer needed or could afford childcare) and Susana currently has a full wait list with the names of children who are still in their mommy\u2019s tummies!\r\n\r\nHer daughter Rena noted, \u201cI think my mom has a natural way with children, and when parents come by to pick up their kids they can see that. I know I\u2019m biased, but honestly, I would recommend her to anyone.\u201d Apparently a natural knack for working with children must run in the family\u2014Rena is currently studying to be a teacher. \u201cI saw how much my mom loves teaching and realized that this was something I could really enjoy as well.\u201d \r\n\r\nBut Susana wants to make her daycare even better. She requested a microloan, her third from Opportunity Fund, for $10,000 to continue improving her backyard to make it more kid-friendly. While the children currently enjoy playing tag in the front yard, modifying the backyard will not only provide them with a playground but will also be a much safer option.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

success of this group of five. They have successfully received and paid back seven loans with Esperanza International. This will be their 8th loan.\r\n<p>  \r\nMagalis C. is the group representative. She has 3 young children ages 10, 8 and 3.  She has a \"fantasia,\" which is a small store where you can buy accessories, personal care products, and school supplies. Magalis plans to add undergarments to her inventory, and will purchase the new products with this loan. Two other members of the group own grocery stores, and the other two run a poultry stand and a fruit stand. \r\n<p>\r\nThe business stability they've experienced after taking out loans is, in their words, \"incomparable\" to their situation beforehand.

She arrived in Lima in search of a better future.  Now she lives and works, along with her sister, selling beauty products.  As she is single and has no children, she has always been a hard worker and dedicates most of her time to that.  She goes out in the early morning hours from house to house and offers her cosmetic products wherever it is possible to sell them.  Lila has always enjoyed her work and she likes to interact with people because she is very charismatic.  She has high hopes and she wants to get ahead, just like her sister who is her \"right hand\" and who we see in her home (in the photo) displaying Lila's merchandise.  But usually they are not at home because of the constant trips they are making to in order to take orders and collect payments for their products.  In the near future, Lila wants to have a large store where she can display her merchandise and not have to go out all the time.

G. who lives in the town of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, is 58 years old and married to Felizardo G. who helps her in running their business.  They are blessed with nine children who are between 13 and 37 years old. Some of the older children have already graduated from college and have their own families. Jasmin now has nine children, but even when they have their own families, her older children still help support the family. \r\n\r\nJasmin started her business by selling bananas in their community and other neighboring villages. During that time, she admitted that her business did not fare so well because sometimes she hardly saved or gained extra income due to the needs of her children and family. But when NWTF-Project Dungganon opened in their area, her husband encouraged her to join. In the year 1998, she was able to join and become a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon. When she received her first loan, she invested it as additional capital for her business. After a while, she decided to buy other kinds of fruit so that she could sell not just bananas to her regular customers. With that decision, she expanded her business using her loans as capital, and her business improved a lot. From banana and fruit vending, now she has a permanent place in the Pulupandan market for her general store. She also sells fruits and vegetables. Her business ventures earn a minimum of Php 15,000 per month and some portion of this income is recycled back into the business and used as additional capital, for the education of her younger children, and to pay for their household expenses. All the extra income is saved in the bank for future use. \r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 10,000 to use as additional working capital for her business. The loan was as usual, fully paid on time without any delays, maintaining Jasmin's good credit record at NWTF-Project Dungganon. For now, she is borrowing Php 15,000 to purchase additional products for her general store and for her fruit and vegetable business.\r\n\r\nHer next plan is to improve her general store and buy some additional products to sell in their community. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":405446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The income generated by this loan will enable him to better provide for his family and educate his child who is still in school.

Five years ago she had to close her hardware store due to the excessive cost of taxes that didn't allow compensation for her sales.\r\n\r\nAt present, she sells by means of requests (with delivery). Following order lists, she prepares materials for sale (for home solutions) and distributes them personally.  Her buyers are her old customers who know her for the quality of her products, and if she has the opportunity to capture more buyers, she loses no time in doing so.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosa closed her business she felt much nostalgia, but with this present type of sales, she feels more comfortable.  She has now been selling by request for 4 years. Her greatest hope is to expand the business and care for her health, since she once fell ill and it complicated matters.\r\n\r\nThis is the 8th loan Rosa has had with MFP, and she knows that credit is important to augment working capital.  For that reason, she is committed to making all her payments on time.  Rosa tries to be very responsible and collaborative with her work group. She plans to invest the present loan in purchasing more hardware items to fulfill pending orders. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":551751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"BUYING MATERIALS TO EXPAND MERCHANDISE IN HER HARDWARE BUSINESS ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":370.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":390.7},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":405.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":424.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":447.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":461.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.65},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":133.28,"local_amount":370.22,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":379.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934627},{"amount":140.65,"local_amount":390.7,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":400.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673400},{"amount":146.02,"local_amount":405.62,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":416.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887223},{"amount":152.82,"local_amount":424.49,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":435.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154234},{"amount":160.93,"local_amount":447.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":458.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449541},{"amount":166.3,"local_amount":461.95,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":473.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588229}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T13:23:53Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":210659,"name":"Soutien Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlotte N. is the leader of the group named \u201cSoutien Plus\u201d that consists of 24 members firmly united to receive loans from the MFI (micro-finance institution) HOPE RDC in order to develop their businesses.\r\n\r\nCharlotte is 53 years old.

She lives with her partner Pablo with whom she has 1 child, 12 years old, in her own house in the city of Merced. Nieves learns quickly. She learned the business helping her sister-in-law who sells meat. Thus Nieves starts her work from 4 in the afternoon. For this she buys poultry such as hens, chickens and ducks which benefit from being plucked. \"I work alone. Once I've finished plucking and eviscerating the poultry I put them in the freezer for distribution the next day,\" she explains. For this work, she goes twice a week to the city of  Huancayo where she gets poultry at a better price. \"I pay 12 soles a kilo but sell it for 19 or 20 doles. It's good money,\" she says.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of time and the continuity of her business, Nieves hopes to rent and fit out a kiosk in the city oval so there will be no need to deliver her product straight to her customers hands. This will be her first loan with MFP so she agrees to be punctual with her repayments. \"Mujeres al Exito\" is the name of her communal bank and she is very exicted at belonging to the group. On receiving the loan she will invest it in the purchase of poultry such as: hens, ducks and chickens and as demand grows with the Christmas season she will also buy turkeys to continue her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":935455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy poultry such as chickens. ducks, hens and turkeys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-04T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":121.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":140.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":148.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":157.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":163.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.55,"local_amount":87.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":90.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836253},{"amount":36.53,"local_amount":95.31,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":98.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246013},{"amount":38.61,"local_amount":100.72,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386040},{"amount":42.55,"local_amount":111.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":114.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099129},{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":112.77,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":116.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713289},{"amount":380.53,"local_amount":992.68,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1026.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202164}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T02:20:33Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":370507,"name":"Trerk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trerk, 64, is widowed and resides with two daughters and four grandchildren in Prey Veng Province, Cambodia. \r\n\r\nShe is unemployed, but she stays home and looks after her grandchildren.

Long beans has been the main producer of the farm, which depends on rainfall as main water source. Besides a well that Wayan Buda digged to help with watering during the dry season. In his current activities, Wayan Buda is often assisted by his 2 sons, \r\nI Putu Nugraha Adi and I Kadek Ari, who both finished highschool but are still jobless. Except work that does not need extra hands, he did all by himself, like: planting, fertilize and spraying pesticides.  For one long beans planting season, Wayan Buda needs a capital of about Rp3,000,000 to 4,000,000 (about US$330-440), this depends on fertilizer, and pesticides cost to be sprayed. Harvest Income during the 3 months  is about Rp5,500,00-Rp6,500,000 (about U$630-730), so that nett profit is about Rp600,000 (about $66)\/month.\r\nWith the loan, Wayan Buda could plant long beans 2 times.

C., 32, is single.  She has two children, a 10-year old son in the fifth grade and an 8-year old son in the third grade.  Ana's goal is to keep her business going, something that's extremely important to her.  Her greatest wish is that her sons get a good education because she would like to see them adopt professional careers.  Things are tough these days but her boys have a chance to get ahead with a good education.  She would also like to improve her house because it needs repairs that she would like to make.\r\n<p>\r\nAna operates a business selling food and cold drinks.  Her business is located in her house and she's operated it for 3 years.  She started the business because she needed a source of income to support her family and pay household debts.

She is married  with four  children, between the ages of 14 and 20.  She also supports two dependents who are orphans. \r\n\r\nMessia has run a charcoal  business since 1996;  Charcoal comes from small, black pieces of dry earth used to cook meals. Women cook food in small coal pots.  Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six  days a week.  Messia earns about $60 a month. She requests a loan in order to purchase more charcoal in bulk for her business.  In the future, she plans to open a new business.  Messia thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n--------------------------\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying & selling fish in the local community. Jessica has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jessica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jessica is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jessica from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

He buys and sells new and used clothing, which he distributes as a street vendor and mainly via orders. The problem that he faces often is that sometimes the sales are good and sometimes they weren't. It's worth noting that he has been doing this business for five years. He started it selling used clothing. Back then he would buy a variety of clothing. It wasn't much because he didn't have a lot of customers, but it grew.  Another member of the group is Jos\u00e9 Antonio. He is 32 years old, married and has two children who are 7 and 5. His wife works in San Marcos as a cleaning woman. He has had his business for two years and has an established clientele. The last member is Jeanette. She sells fruit. She also sells cooked sweet corn and tortillas. She has been doing this activity for more than 5 years.

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,400, thereby uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 with which she intends to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements and expansion of her business.
