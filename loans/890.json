Her partner of the past 6 years is William, 38, with whom she has a 2-year old son.  They live in his mother\u2019s house, where they educate their son; they want to give him a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer business is the rental of her car as a taxi.  She rents to a driver on a daily basis, from which she receives an amount that helps cover some of the necessities of the home.  However, to do this, her tool for work must be in optimal condition, from the cleaning of the outside of the car, to supervising, verifying, and proving that all the systems are working properly.\r\n\r\nShe carries out this work with the help of an auto mechanic, and also ensures that all the vehicle registrations are valid so there will be no problems with the transit authorities.  She has been doing this activity for 2 years, and was able to buy the car after a great deal of hard work and constant struggle in her previous business of selling food and clothes.  \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it allows her to dedicate her free time to caring for her baby.  After doing other work, her income has increased, which allows her to improve her standard of living.  However, everything was not always so favorable; at the beginning, it was very complicated because she didn\u2019t know much about the business but, over time, her ability improved and she now feels calm about everything she is receiving.  In the future, she would like to buy herself another car and, little by little, create a large enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know she has a means of financial support since this lets her feel more secure in growing her business.  Likewise, she once again commits to making her loan payments on time the way she did before.  She is also very glad to belong to her cooperative bank, as all the members are very responsible and united.  With the amount requested (1200 Peruvian soles), she will buy some replacement parts, tires, and do the mechanical checkup that her car is lacking.  She will also obtain the registration documents, insurance and will refurbish some details.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1118131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to make repairs and obtain vehicle registrations for her car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-17T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-17T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":176.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":199.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.26,"local_amount":176.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":177.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099020},{"amount":71.77,"local_amount":191.41,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":192.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401913},{"amount":74.46,"local_amount":198.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":199.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456187},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":199.93,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451853},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":213.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":214.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447028},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":220.03,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":220.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052933}],"funded_date":"2012-06-24T04:08:59Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":438207,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa tiene 56 a\u00f1os, es una mujer luchadora, optimista, servicial y muy trabajadora.

46, is a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ponciano, a carpenter, and is a mother to her child. They together manage their household expenses while operating their respective businesses. She works hard to continuously provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercedita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her neighbors and the local community are her regular customers. She also maintains a direct selling business as a source of additional income. She earns a minimum of PHP 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMercedita hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own car service that will be used for the business. She also dreams that her business will become big someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1118241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2838.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359476},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3547.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303298},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356020},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114121}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T07:16:55Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trupti  Kamath","image":null}},{"id":438245,"name":"Filipina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filipina is 44 years old and married with five children.

The older child is five years old, and the younger is three. Her husband is a migrant laborer. Her husband's parents are dependent on them. Shoira's love of sewing began in childhood. It is a profession which was passed on to her by her mother. In the past she sewed for her own enjoyment and needs, but after marrying and facing serious financial problems in the family she decided to help her husband who last sent her money four months ago. Her husband is currently unemployed and unable to send his wife money. She decided to sew seriously not just for herself but to order. After finding out about classes for women run by NABWT (National Association of Business Women of Tajikistan) in cooperation with IMON International, Shoira became an active participant and after learning the needed information, submitted an application for a loan. She is a very confident and skillful woman, and able to reach her stated goals. Shoira would like to buy a sewing machine and the supplies needed for sewing traditional and European dresses. She very much hopes for your kindness and help. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1115615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To buy a sewing machine and the necessary fabrics for sewing of national and European dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shoira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.15},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":177.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":0.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294596305},{"amount":999.98,"local_amount":999.98,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":999.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301429827}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T09:29:20Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":438538,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is 22 years old.

As he lives far from the city, he was unable to attend university, and instead stayed to help his parents. He also raises peanuts seasonally and early in the morning he sells the peanuts to traders in the market. His son is still young, but when there are more children he wants to provide them all with the higher education he himself could not obtain, and later build them homes and pay for their weddings. To do this he needs to save a certain sum for each child, and so Farhod is already beginning to save.

She is a good woman, friendly and hardworking. She is separated from her partner. She is the mother of two children who are 18 and 5 years old. They live in her father\u2019s house, next to her sister and her two nephews.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling beer. Every Monday she orders from the distributors with whom she works, and they deliver the boxes of beer to her home, and she puts it in the refrigerator to be ready for consumption. She also sells soft drinks, ice, and fruit lollipops. She has been doing this work for more than three years with the help of her sister. For some time she has been selling roasted chicken on the weekends, as she has seen in this business the perfect opportunity to sell more beer and soft drinks. At times she also sells clothing.\r\n\r\nShe still remembers the first day that she began to sell drinks, all the fears and doubts that she had, but little by little she was establishing and learning the business. Now she is a great saleslady and has many customers and plans for the future, such as putting in a bar and later a distributorship.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan through MFP, and she is grateful to those that make it possible for her to continue with her objectives. On her part, she is very committed to meeting her payment schedule on time, as she did on the previous loans she has had. Also she is happy to be a member of her communal bank as all of the members are good, kind, and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 2000 soles she will buy more beer and soft drinks, and also ingredients and supplies in order to continue preparing her meals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1118137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beer, soft drinks, and ingredients and supplies in order to continue preparing meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":294.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":318.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":332.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":355.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":367.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.35,"local_amount":294.27,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":295.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099021},{"amount":119.56,"local_amount":318.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":319.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401916},{"amount":124.01,"local_amount":330.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":331.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456190},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":334.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451856},{"amount":133.29,"local_amount":355.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":356.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447031},{"amount":137.92,"local_amount":367.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":369.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052936}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T04:40:37Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":438544,"name":"Vedaste","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vedaste is aged 22.

This will improve the store's condition, increase sales and improve the family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1118748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To improve the store's condition and buy a collection of mobile phones for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T04:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T04:00:07Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sameera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":108.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":112.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":114.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":116.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":129.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":134.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":137.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":139.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":142.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":438634,"name":"Kadzo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kadzo is a business lady living in Malindi town, Kenya.

She is a kind, supportive and very responsible woman. She has been with her partner, Victor, for 12 years. He is 54, and they have two children, age 12 and 3.\r\n\r\nRosa works selling food and juices. Every day, from early morning, she sells juices made from the freshest fruits of the region (orange, papaya, grapefruit and others), and breakfast sandwiches of egg, chicken, cheese, avocado or bolognese. In the evening she sells dishes typical of the region: the richest roast chicken, fish and pork, with her own secret seasoning. Her stall is on the pavement outside her house, and she has had it for 2 years. She also works for a state government agency, and also sells cleaning products door-to-door, such as detergents, air fresheners, wax and soap, so as to bring in some additional income. Like any woman wanting to excel, she has many goals, but the main one, for now, is to consolidate her food business, as she wants to develop a space inside her house to make the work easier and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's fifth loan with MFP, and she welcomes the opportunity and confidence placed in her. She agrees to make the repayments on time. She likes being part of the communal bank to which she belongs, as the members are responsible and supportive of each other. With the requested amount (1500 Soles), Rosa will buy fruits, ingredients and supplies to continue her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1118136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fruit, ingredients and consumables to continue her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":248.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":249.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":274.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.4,"local_amount":460.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":472.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401915},{"amount":95.16,"local_amount":248.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":254.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456189},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":249.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451855},{"amount":102.27,"local_amount":266.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":273.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447030},{"amount":105.35,"local_amount":274.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":281.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052935}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T20:02:37Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":438479,"name":"Valon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valon is from Kosovo.

She lives in her own house which she built on land given to her by her parents.\r\n\r\nHer business activity is selling clothing and shoes, in association with her mother and out of her home, to neighbors and friends.  Ligia also works as a street vendor at the local market.  She began her business five years ago with her own capital, encouraged by her mother and buying in small quantities that gradually increased as the demand grew.  She believes her business is quite profitable because she always sells everything she takes to sell.  Before beginning her business she had economic difficulties since her expenses increased when she got divorced.  She has to be both father and mother to her daughter and wants to give her a better quality of life and a good education.  She also wants to help her mother with the household expenses.

His crops are well taken care of since he knows the family income depends on this business.  He takes the crops to the city to sell to the cocoa and coffee collection associations, located about 30 minutes from his community.  What he enjoys most about his work is farming the land and taking enough care to obtain a good harvest.  For 30 years he has been working in this trade (he began as a child with his parents), and he feels he always has to avoid plant disease to protect his crops.

Because they also need more support to cover the family's needs and costs, Samaher is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband purchase more spare parts to resell. This will increase sales and improve the family's income.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:<p>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He was able to purchase the land with his parents\u2019 help. He works with the help of his wife and children, but during the harvest he hires workers to pick the cocoa beans more quickly. Later, he sells them at collection centers where he receives a good price per pound.

She has been separated from her partner for many years and has four children who are already grown and independent.  Only her 37-year-old daughter Diana lives with her.  Mis\u00e9lida owns her house, which she bought with great effort and after many years of saving.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is a multi-faceted woman who has a vision for business.  Mis\u00e9lida has developed different ventures according to the season.  One of her businesses is buying and selling basic staples such as corn, beans, and kudzu.  On a few special occasions or on celebration dates, she will sell clothing.  However, her main business activity is selling food since she enjoys cooking.  She has no hesitation in preparing and selling food every day, especially the delicious dish of chicken and fried potatoes commonly known as \u201csalchipollo\u201d, which is served with a healthy portion of rice.  This dish has become a favorite among all her customers.  Mis\u00e9lida has worked alone ever since she started her business six years ago.  She still gets excited about the process of growth that she has had to go through in order to earn the public\u2019s trust.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Mis\u00e9lida hopes to have a restaurant where she can sell all day and be able to prepare food in much calmer conditions since she currently works alone and into the night.  Even though she has gained experience through her work, Mis\u00e9lida still finds it difficult to serve all of her customers.  She expects all of her efforts to result in a fruitful outcome, just like in past experiences, so this is the only thing that drives her to press forward.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 10th loan with MFP.  Mis\u00e9lida is very pleased to know that she has financial backing and feels more confident about advancing in her work.  At the same time, she promises once again to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  She is glad to be part of her Communal Bank since all of the members are responsible and supportive.  The amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy ingredients, supplies, and cooking utensils so that she can continue preparing her most requested dish and keep all of her customers happy.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1117955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients, supplies, and cooking utensils.

","en":"Baktygul is a thirty-nine-year-old married mother raising 4 children. She works as a teacher of Kyrgyz language in the Bokonbaevo village school, but she also raises animals in order to supplement her teacher's salary. She began this business with a sum of 20,000 soms and today, due to her hard work, she owns 2 cows, 30 sheep and 2.08 hectares of land she uses to cultivate potatoes and cock's head, which serves as fodder for her herd. Her monthly income from the business is about 10,000 soms. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Baktygul approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan 110,000 soms (KGS). This loan would allow her to purchase some livestock for fattening and resale. She plans to invest profits from the loan back into her business and build up some savings so that she could pay for her son Sirgat and her daughter Nyrjamal to go to college.

Nana earns a living by caring for two milk cows, whose output allows her to make cheese every day for sale in the local market. The family's total average monthly income is 900 Lari. Nana and and her husband work hard but are unable to earn enough money to set aside savings to buy household goods they need or to renovate their house.  \r\n\r\nNana has requested a loan to buy a new milk cow. With three cows, she will be able to produce and sell more dairy products, such as cheese, curds and yogurt. She will use her increased income to repair her house, which is old and uncomfortable. This will allow her family to rest comfortably after finishing a hard day's work.

She and her partner have three young children who are dependent on them, so she wants them to have a good quality of life.  They live in their own home as a unified and hardworking family.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer job consists of selling candy from a stand located in her home, which is frequented by her customers since her business is well-situated in her neighborhood.  M\u00f3nica is well-known for her good humor and charisma, which has helped her to make sales and generate the income that she needs.  Her desire to be independent and the need to cover the daily family expenses are the main reasons that motivate her to develop her business.  She has been in operation for three years and was very timid at first, but over time she developed her personal qualities and now is able to generate good sales.  For this reason, she is very pleased.  M\u00f3nica enjoys talking with her customers and making them laugh.  However, the most difficult part is dealing with low sales due to the strong heat of the sun during the morning hours.  She enjoys having a candy stand because she can sell comfortably and still offer a wide variety of products to her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  She is grateful to everyone who made this loan possible so that she can continue pursuing her goals.  Once again, she is very committed to complete her payments on time in the same manner as before.  M\u00f3nica is very pleased to be part of her Communal Bank since all of the members are fine individuals who are friendly and supportive.  The loan amount of 1,000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy a large quantity of candy that she can offer to her customers.  She also plans to start selling a few groceries from her stand.

She has been separated from her partner for many years.  Roc\u00edo currently lives in her own home, which was built alongside her ex-partner.  There she lives with three of her four children.  Together they strive day after day to improve their standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nRoc\u00edo is a woman who has always worked to get ahead.  She does various jobs in order to generate income, which include doing other people's laundry and selling soft drinks on the weekends.  Occasionally she works with another woman in selling food, but her most frequent business activity is selling clothes.  Roc\u00edo has been in this business for two years.  She started out initially selling only to friends and relatives, but now she sells clothes by going door-to-door.  The articles of clothing are brought in from another city where they can be purchased in bulk.  These products are known for being made from quality materials and for being styled in the latest designs.  What she enjoys most about her work is being able to set her own schedule so that she can devote time to different activities.  At first, the most difficult part for Roc\u00edo was being able to get rid of a large quantity of merchandise but this concern diminished as she began making sales more quickly.  She is eager to continue with her work because she enjoys what she does and hopes to eventually have a clothing store where she can display her merchandise more easily and comfortably.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  Roc\u00edo is grateful for this opportunity and the trust that has been demonstrated to her.  She also promises to complete her payments in a punctual manner.  Roc\u00edo is glad to be part of her Communal Bank since she believes the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  The loan amount of 1,200 PEN that she requested will be invested in the purchase of clothing in different sizes and styles for both sexes.  She hopes to continue offering innovative products that are of high quality to her customers.

He has set up a space in his home to see his customers. Sometimes he also makes house calls, since he is very good at his job. He has been in this business a little over five years and gets help from another young man.

He has been doing this for almost two years, and knowing all that he can now offer his family gives him peace of mind. \r\n\r\nFor the time being he really likes working as a mechanic, because he gets very good pay and the customer base is steady, which allows him to have work every day. He assures us it was hard for him in the beginning because he couldn't serve all the customers, until he was able to have another person to help and the situation improved. Now he hopes to keep working and save a little so that further on he may have a larger business place and stock his shop with repair parts to sell. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, so he is grateful for the opportunity and the trust deposited in him.

The area where she lives is suitable for production and selling coffee is a very profitable business in this country.  \n\nDo\u00f1a Alma is requesting her fifth loan from ODEF in the amount of 5,000 HNL so that she can buy fertilizer and pay for labor to help maintain her farm.

She resides in a rural village located in the Sa Ang district of Kampong Cham province. She has seven children, four of whom are dependent on her and only two of them are still in school while the other two are workers. To make a living to support her big family, she and her husband have been planting beans and cucumbers for almost twenty years. \r\n\r\nTouch received her first loan from VisionFund five cycles ago and she completely paid back the loans with VisionFund.

She is married to Jun, a laborer, and is a mother of two children. Both children are in college. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLoida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoida hopes to be able to expand soon.

She is single, and does not yet have children.  She lives in her mother's house along with her 3 siblings.  Each of them shares her goal of improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosalia has a business selling clothing.  Once or twice a month, she travels to the capital city to buy garments at wholesale.  Later, she offers them for sale to her friends, relatives and other people she knows.  She makes her sales on installment credit.  Ever since she started this business 4 years ago, she has worked on her own.  She has seen that this is a very profitable activity because it generates good earnings that help her to cover her personal expenses and those of her family.\r\n\r\nWhat Rosalia likes about her business is that it allows her to have time to devote to her education, and also to do some household chores when needed.  At times she has struggled with making her collections in such a way as to have the money on hand that she needs to renew her inventory of clothing.  However, she has gradually been gaining the respect and trust of her customers, who don't hesitate to make their payments at the agreed time or even sooner.  In the future she wants to have a place where she could set up her own small clothing store.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is very pleased to know that she has financial support, because this way she feels more certain that she will make progress with her work.

She lives with Jorge, with whom she has three children.\r\n\r\nHer work is making and mending clothes.  She also makes her own designs and sells them at her small place.  She also sells garments that she buys wholesale from other cities.  Her customers trust her because she is patient with all of the details so that she produces quality work and that the finishing touches are always satisfactory.\r\n\r\nShe has been working alone for three years.  She has seen that this business generates good income for her, and it has allowed her to cover the family expenses.  She really likes what she does even though she sometimes has felt that she could not continue because she was not able to create a new design.  That is why she took fashion training courses, and that helped her a lot.  In time she was able to overcome this fear, and she is now an excellent dressmaker.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She is grateful to those who make it possible for her to continue with her objectives.  She is very committed, once again, to making her payments punctually, as she did previously.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy to belong to her communal bank.

36 years old and married with no children yet. She and her husband reside in the village earning a living through planting cassava as the main source of the family's income and sometimes they work for others for pay. She has been in this business for several years and she still encounters a lack of working capital to support her business. \r\n\r\nMun successfully paid back her first loan with VisonFund, which has helped her better support her family.  With her current business, she is able to earn 5,500 KHR per day.

She lives with her husband and four dependent children, who are still in school, in a rural village of the Tbaung Khmum district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia. To make a living, she has been farming rice on one hectare of farmland and planting cassava on two hectares of farmland for almost twenty-one years, earning around 8,500 KHR per day to spend for daily basic needs. A lack of working capital is still her main challenge in growing her business. \r\n\r\nUn's group consists of three members who are all females and they successfully repaid their loan with VisionFund.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Angela earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Angela hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have a peaceful life and a life close to God.\n\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has set fares according to the destinations, and the passengers don\u2019t argue about it.\r\n\r\nYasmeen herself is also a very hardworking lady. She is involved in a sewing business, and her work is home-based. She collects orders from neighboring customers and earns well by completing them on time. She has been operating her business for more than 4 years. She also provides embroidery services to her customers. She crafts beautiful embroidery designs on clothes, which helps her attract many more customers. \r\n\r\nYasmeen will use the loan to purchase a sewing machine because with her current machine it takes a lot of time to sew a single dress. She will also use the loan to purchase embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread, and sketches for the further improvement of her sewing & embroidery business.

27-year-old mother of two dependent children who are still in school. She and her husband are peasants who have been farming maize for eight years to make a living and sometimes they work for others for pay to better support their children. With her current business, she is able to earn around 7,000 KHR per day and she is still in a lack of capital for farming. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Simean's group of three female members who live in the same village.

Her loan should be successful because her sales are based on customer orders. What she buys has a fast turnover, which causes her working capital to turn quickly and therefore increase her profits.

He owns his own home and there, together with his family, he shares the happiness of making progress in life and achieving success.\r\n\r\nJoe is in the construction trade.  He is a builder.  He does private work and works on recommendations.  He is very meticulous in his work and always looks to leave any job in tip-top condition so that his customers are satisfied and happy with the job.  In addition to this work, he also works as a carpenter.  Joe has been in this trade for four years.  Both of these businesses make him good profits which allow him to cover his family's basic needs.  What he enjoys about his work is that he is able to suggest new building styles to his customers and, when he puts them into practice, he becomes very emotional when he sees his finished work.  He is passionate about improving his work and being able to own his own building company.\r\n\r\nThis is Joe's second loan from MFP.  He is very happy to know that he has financial support as it makes him feel more secure in making progress in his work.

Aitkul works as an accountant at the local administration office of the Ton village and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in breeding livestock.  After starting this business in 1992 with a sum of 2,000 som and thanks to Aitkul's hard work, today her business contains two cows, eleven sheep, one horse and also 1.08 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually gathers clover for livestock feed.

She is a very hard-working, entrepreneurial, honest woman who has not had a partner for many years.  However, she has three children who are all now adults.  Adilia lives in her own home alongside her youngest son whose name is Sedny.  Every day the pair both work and make efforts to make progress.\r\n\r\nAdilia's main business is selling food, mainly meat from wild animals such as deer, tapirs, turtles, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lowland_Paca\">paca<\/a> and farmyard hens.  In addition, she also sells bananas and regional fruits.  In the past, she would raise these species on her own farm and thereby supply her own business with animals.  Now, however, she buys them from people in the countryside and those living in indigenous communities.  She has been in this business for 20 years and works extra hard when the town is celebrating a festival or important event.  Adilia has also been selling used clothing and perfumes for two years on a casual basis.  All of these businesses make her good income and provide her with financial peace of mind.\r\n\r\nWhat Adilia likes about her work is the fact that she is in contact with other people.  Being physically active all the time gives her a lot of energy and vitality.  Above all, she feels happy because she is able to make her own income and thereby continue covering her own expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is Adilia's seventh loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support because it makes her feel more secure as she makes progress in her work.  For this reason, she pledges once again to make her loan repayments on time as she has in the past.  She is very happy to belong to her community bank because all the members of the bank are very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nAdilia will use the 1,500 she has requested to buy farmyard hens, turtle meat and other wild animal meat.

To begin with, she used to sell at the door of her home, but later did so all over the city, carrying her fruit drink containers in a cart. But now she has her stand, thanks to  an agreement with the municipal authority of her district, and now sells much more than before. \r\n\r\nShe has worked at this livelihood from a young age, and now has been doing it for 20 years, always working alone. And even though now it is going very well, she acknowledges that at the beginning she had many difficulties, as she didn't know how to prepare the fruit drinks very well. However, now she has become an expert and her delicious drinks are considered the best in her part of the city. She is very happy, because the profitability of this business has allowed her to make many changes and improvements in her living conditions. She really likes what she does. She enjoys talking with her customers and that way knowing their preferences and tastes when it comes to flavors. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, so she is grateful to those who make it possible for her to continue toward her goals.

This is the reason for this Kiva loan, the second loan that she has taken from Yehu Microfinance Trust. She will use this loan to buy sacks of rice, beans, peas and sugar.

She has two adult children who have their own families. She lives alone in her own house, which she was able to get after lots of hard work alongside her husband. Occasionally, her children and grandchildren come to visit; those are the moments at home that fill her with great happiness.\r\n\r\nShe works making clothing. With great patience, she produces the garments that her customers request as well as one-of-a-kind garments that she designs and offers for sale in a small space in her residence. Every style that she creates is sold quickly because of the variety, creativity, and personal touch that she adds to her creations. She has done this work for more than thirty years; she has always worked alone and points out that she has never had any complaints from her customers. \r\n\r\nNow, in the last few months she has branched out into the sale of beer. Both activities allow her to generate her own income and not depend on her children's money. What she likes about her sewing work is that she can express her inspiration in a garment, which makes her feel productive; she hopes to soon construct a much larger workshop with a space set aside especially for the sale of her creations.\r\n\r\nThis is Ana's second loan with MFP, and she appreciates those who make it possible for her to continue toward her objectives. On the other hand, she is very committed to making her punctual loan repayments once a month, like she did last time. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since all the members are very good, kind, and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she has requested (300 PEN), Ana will buy the fabric and thread that she needs to create more garments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1118359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":52.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":46.46,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":51.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099024},{"amount":18.91,"local_amount":45.39,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401930},{"amount":20.62,"local_amount":49.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":55.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456204},{"amount":21.39,"local_amount":51.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":57.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451869},{"amount":21.76,"local_amount":52.22,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447045},{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":55.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":61.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052950}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T23:57:22Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":438561,"name":"Nancy Violeta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy  es  una persona  muy trabajadora  ella  se preocupa   por  el bienestar de su  familia y por  acondicionar  su  vivienda, ella se acerco a la instituci\u00f3n ya  que  desea colocar   piso  de  concreto  afuera de su  casa para que  de esta  manera  no entre  tanto polvo a  su vivienda,  esta  muy  contenta  de habernos  encontrado  ya  que  su   hogar  tendr\u00e1  una  mejor imagen por  lo que  agradece  el  apoyo  para  la realizaci\u00f3n de su proyecto.","en":"Nancy is a hard-working person whose main concern is her family's welfare.

They have 3 hectare of land, where broom is grown. After harvesting, Goichak and her mother-in-law make brooms and sell them on the local open market. In addition to the agricultural business, Goichak is busy with trading. She purchases clothes and shoes at wholesale markets and sells them in nearby villages.

She\u2019s been with her husband, thirty year old Victor, for seven years and they have two children, seven year old Hugo and three year old Virginia.  They live in a home that they own and that she acquired with her husband\u2019s help, after many years of hard work.\r\n\r\nShe sells fast food, primarily broasted chicken.  She does this every day and rises early to go to the market to buy the necessary ingredients and she sells from a window in her home after 5:00 pm.  Sometimes she does it from within her home when it rains.  This has allowed her to maintain loyal customers who know that she will always serve them, any day and in any situation.  She is a very happy and charismatic saleswoman and this is why her customers prefer her; this and because of the delicious seasoning on her dishes.\r\n\r\nShe remembers when she began (five years ago) and only sold a few portions, but with a lot of effort she was able to get more customers and her sales increased.  She also makes extra money selling ice and drinks, which is sometimes difficult for her because she has to move the heavy cases of beer.  In the future she wants to have a bigger place where she can provide better service to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 7th loan through MFP and she is happy to know that she has financial backing and this way she feels more secure in getting ahead with her work.  She is also committed, once again, to be on time with her payments, as before.  She is glad to be part of a communal bank because all of the members are very united and responsible.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 3,000 PEN to buy ingredients to continue with her business and will set up her place with some tables and chairs and also buy some cases soft drinks and beer so that she is ready for the summer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1118384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T21:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T21:40:23Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":464.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":453.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":494.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":513.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":522.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":550.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":344.48,"local_amount":918.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":922.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401935},{"amount":185.59,"local_amount":494.91,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":496.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456209},{"amount":192.51,"local_amount":513.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":515.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451874},{"amount":195.86,"local_amount":522.31,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":524.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447050},{"amount":206.56,"local_amount":550.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":552.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052955}],"funded_date":"2012-07-18T20:36:02Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

They decided to give their group this name because it is the name of the place where they meet up to make their payments.  Each one of these women has a job: Silvia and Mirna sell shoes from a catalog; Gloria sells clothing made of manta (a natural unbleached cotton) and cosmetics; and, lastly, Paulina has a small grocery store.  Their group is located in a sugar-producing region where its people make a living through sowing and cultivating sugarcane.\n\nGloria is 24-years-old, studies in the university, and is single.  Five years ago she decided to start working in her own business since she thought that she would earn more being her own boss.  She sells clothing made of manta (like shirts, skirts, dresses, and cloth napkins), which is typical for the region, that she goes out to buy in the city of Oaxaca.  She also sells cosmetics from a catalog.  Gloria makes her sales by going from house to house to offer her products to customers and acquaintances.  She said, \"sales are good, and when I don't bring a product they place orders and I supply them.  I quite like selling in the streets because I meet many people and I sell a lot.\"  She is happy with her business and with the passage of time has managed to get many customers, which helps her increase her earnings.  \n\nGloria will invest her loan in the purchase of a variety of clothing made of manta (shirts, skirts, dresses, and cloth napkins) and cosmetics in order to continue making sales. She hopes that in the future she will continue making sales, that her business will prosper more, and that she will thus have a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1107762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural unbleached cotton clothing and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1503.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1519.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1535.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1552.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1569.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1586.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1603.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1620.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1655.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1673.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1691.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1709.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1728.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1746.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1765.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1784.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1804.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1823.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":974.19,"local_amount":13977.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14061.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568695},{"amount":583.28,"local_amount":8368.77,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8419.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399985},{"amount":489.69,"local_amount":7025.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7068.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407643},{"amount":252.84,"local_amount":3627.76,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3649.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120156}],"funded_date":"2012-07-01T13:11:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":436706,"name":"Meherrem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meherrem is 28 years old, married with two children. He raises fruits and vegetables in his garden and has been doing so for the past 2 years. He is a very experienced farmer and has deep knowledge of the land and how to operate it. He was not able to find job for several years and than decided to start his own business. \n \nMeherrem usually raises seasonal fruits and vegetables and sells them for profitable price in the central bazaar. Fresh fruits and vegetables are very popular and in high demand because people prefer to eat them every day and consider them very healthy. One of the favorite national dishes, dolma, is made of fresh eggplants, peppers and tomatoes. His monthly income from this business is 200 AZN.
