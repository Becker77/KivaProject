","en":"Vali is a hardworking man.  He is married and raises three children who are still quite young (the oldest is 6, the second is 3 and the youngest is 1 year old).\r\n\r\nVali and his family have had difficult life circumstances.  In 2000, Vali's father started a private farm on 350 hectares of land.  Within three years of operation they suffered great losses due to difficult weather conditions.  As a result, they had to divide the land among members of the farming business and into nine parts.  Vali's family ended up with 19 hectares of land. \r\n\r\nAs they didn't have the necessary means to plant and harvest, Vali planned a trip to Russia to earn some money.  However, he suddenly fell ill and had to stay in a hospital  for a long time.  Having recovered, he went to Russia, where he worked for two years.  When he came back home with some money, he once again started to get involved in cattle fattening and crop cultivation.  \r\n\r\nHe now mainly grows wheat, corn, peas and other agricultural products and has been involved in this activity for more than three years.  His caring wife and his father help him with the business.  He sells harvested crops directly to the local residents at a much lower price than what can be bought at the market.\r\n\r\nA large number of the residents of this district buy their produce from him.\r\n\r\nVali would like to get a loan to buy seeds, fuel and lubricants.  With the rest of the money, he would also like to purchase livestock to increase his herd.\r\n\r\n

Vive solo en su casa propia, la misma que pudo obtenerla gracias al esmero que pone d\u00eda a d\u00eda en sus actividades laborales. Actualmente est\u00e1 separado de quien fue su esposa por muchos a\u00f1os, fruto de su matrimonio tiene tres hijos, dos de los cuales ya son mayores de edad y se encarga solo de la menor de ellos, de 17 a\u00f1os. Por ella se esfuerza para poder brindarle lo necesario para sus estudios y para obtener su carrera profesional.\n\nLa principal fuente de ingresos es la construcci\u00f3n, su mano de obra es muy solicitada entre las personas que conocen de su trabajo y lo buscan para contribuir en la edificaci\u00f3n de alg\u00fan proyecto. Su experiencia en esta actividad es su principal carta de presentaci\u00f3n, ya que conoce a detalle todas las pautas necesarias que se exigen en una obra de construcci\u00f3n. Dependiendo de la magnitud puede trabajar solo o acompa\u00f1ado de un grupo de personas que el mismo se encarga de seleccionar, depende tambi\u00e9n de la urgencia que su cliente le exija. En cada uno de los trabajos que ha realizado se esfuerza por dar lo mejor de s\u00ed, buscando en todo momento la tranquilidad y confortabilidad de sus clientes. Lleva desarrollando este oficio hace 15 a\u00f1os y le va muy bien. Por otro lado, eventualmente se dedica a manejar su mocarro haciendo servicio de taxi, y por si fuera poco tambi\u00e9n pretende construir algunas habitaciones en su terreno para alquilarlas, con todo ello busca mejorar su nivel de vida.\nDisfruta mucho de trabajar en la construcci\u00f3n, sabe que con ese trabajo pudo brindar lo necesario a su familia por muchos a\u00f1os; lo complicado es cargar las bolsas pesadas de cemento y manipular las mezclas con sus propias manos, ya que le producen ardor en los dedos y el envejecimiento de la piel. Es por eso que espera trabajar un tiempo m\u00e1s en esta actividad, ahorrar lo suficiente e invertir en el alquiler de habitaciones.\n\nEste es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 10 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes lo hacen posible, para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado, est\u00e1 muy comprometido, una vez m\u00e1s, en cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo anteriormente. Y est\u00e1 muy contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal, ya que todos sus integrantes son muy buenos, amables y solidarios.\n\nCon el monto solicitado (S\/. 500) desea renovar algunas herramientas para mejorar su trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n desea comprar madera y calaminas para construir su primera habitaci\u00f3n para alquiler.\n","en":"Enrique is 50 years old.  He is a very hard-working and responsible man.  He lives alone in his own home that he was able to obtain thanks to the care that he puts into his work every day.  Enrique is currently separated from his wife of many years.  As a result of his marriage, he has three children.  Two of his children are already adults and he is only responsible for the youngest (a girl), who is 17 years old.  For this daughter, he works hard so that he can provide her with an education and help her obtain a degree.\r\n\r\nEnrique's main source of income is the construction trade.  His labor is very much in demand among people who know his work and they seek him out to build their projects for them.  His experience in this trade is his main calling card since he knows all the stages of a building job off by heart.  Depending on the scale of a job, he can either work alone or together with a group of people who he selects himself.  This all depends on the urgency expressed by his customers.  On every job that he does, Enrique insists on providing the very best of himself.  He always seeks to make his customers happy and comfortable.  He has been in this business for 15 years and is doing very well.  On a casual basis, he also provides a taxi service.  As if this weren't enough, he has also built some rooms on his land in order to rent them out.  This is all done in order to improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nEnrique really enjoys working in the building trade.  He knows that, through this work, he is able to provide for his family.  His most difficult task is dealing with the heavy bags of cement and manipulating the mixtures with his own hands because it hurts his fingers and ages his skin.  For this reason, he hopes to work just a short while longer in this business before he is able to save up enough to invest in renting out rooms.\r\n\r\nThis is Enrique's 10th loan from MFP and he is grateful to those who are making his loan possible so that he can continue meeting his goals.  He is very committed, once again, to making his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He is very happy to be a member of his community bank because all of the members are very good, kind, supportive people.\r\n\r\nEnrique would like to use the 500 soles he has requested to replace some of his tools so that he can improve his work.  He would also like to buy wood and metal sheets so that he can build his first room to rent out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1118376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to renew some of his work tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":77.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":82.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099025},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":75.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":81.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401933},{"amount":33.01,"local_amount":82.54,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":88.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456207},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":85.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451872},{"amount":34.85,"local_amount":87.12,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447048},{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":91.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":98.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052953}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T19:07:55Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":438570,"name":"Cecilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Cecilio se dedica a la venta de electrodom\u00e9sticos, y es gracias a su trabajo que pudo juntar un dinero y hoy quiere abrir una tienda de comestibles y venta de bebidas de todo tipo.

She is requesting her first Kiva loan in order to buy a hairdresser\u2019s chair, a dressing table and a cabinet to offer better service to her customers. \r\n\r\nLedis has always been attracted by anything related to beauty. For this reason she decided to take a course in hairdressing four years ago where she learned much about the profession. Once she finished, she started doing hair at people\u2019s homes and gradually became known and acquired customers. However Ledis wanted to have a fixed location where she would have all the equipment needed to provide her services.  Thus she applied for a loan with a financial institution and with it bought the basics needed to start her business at home. Her customers are her neighbors in the area, although she will still go out to someone\u2019s home when it is required. \r\n\r\nLedis pays cash weekly for the materials that she uses and buys from distributors in the city center. Her principal dream is to have a large place, well supplied with all the equipment needed, separate from her home.\r\n\r\nShe lives in a common law relationship and has three minor children. She wants to see them educated and grow up under the best conditions. That is why she does her best for her customers, so that she can increase her sales and earn more income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1118676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Together, they live in the house that her uncle lent them temporarily, where her cousin also lives.\r\n\r\nHer business is the making and selling of aluminum and glass structures, like display cabinets, windows, and various other designs.  She makes sales from her home where she has a space arranged to store the structures.  Her husband is the person in charge of putting the structures together according to the requests of the customer.  The business was begun more than 15 years ago, and they started with their own capital, selling in small quantities.  Over time their sales increased due to demand.  For that reason, seeing the good results that they are having, Dianira wants to continue to increase the stock for their shelves.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution, and she is happy and thankful to know that she can count on financial support in order to continue with her plans.  She also feels comfortable and likes the work of her communal bank, since she knows the other group members and considers them responsible people.  \r\n\r\nWith the amount that she is requesting, 1500 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency), she will invest in the purchase of materials in bulk in order to have stock available, like aluminum bars and glass, so that her husband can continue making the structures."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1118696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials for making the glass and aluminum structures that she sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T00:50:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dianira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":227.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":227.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":248.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":257.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":262.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":276.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.14,"local_amount":227.32,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":233.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099032},{"amount":87.31,"local_amount":227.77,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":233.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401944},{"amount":95.21,"local_amount":248.36,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":254.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456219},{"amount":98.75,"local_amount":257.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":264.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451884},{"amount":100.47,"local_amount":262.1,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":268.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447060},{"amount":106.12,"local_amount":276.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":284.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052965}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T18:19:15Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":438583,"name":"Esmeralda Elizeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esmeralda, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo, para la compra de leche, queso y cuajada, para la producci\u00f3n, ya que le ayudara para mantener un buen nivel de estos productos y atender la clientela de mejor manera, con un buen inventario, este pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 una gran ayuda pues considera que a trav\u00e9s de \u00e9l podr\u00e1 mejorar su condici\u00f3n en las ventas.\nElla manifiesta haber tenido una buena experiencia con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior, ya que se le proporciono lo necesario para mantener una buena producci\u00f3n de l\u00e1cteos, que hasta el momento le ha generado una mejor condici\u00f3n con su familia. \n","en":"Esmeralda is asking for a loan in order to purchase milk, cheese and curds for the making of various milk and cheese products.

His partner of 30 years is Nancy, who is 45 years old.  Eliu owns his house, which he and his partner built with much effort and intense work days.  They live with their youngest daughter (they have four children in all) who is 18 and is hard at work studying for her professional career.\r\n\r\nEliu makes a living selling groceries, vegetables, and other basic necessities.  He has a small grocery store that he has set up in his home.  He and his partner work every day attending to customers who come to purchase the products they need for food preparation.  Eliu\u2019s store is open from five in the morning, and he treats each of his customers with great respect.  \r\n\r\nEliu has had this business for about 5 years, and was able to make economic progress during that time; however, he felt that this wasn\u2019t enough, since the income he earned from sales wasn\u2019t sufficient to provide his family with a decent life.  That is why Eliu started working part-time providing a security service on the streets of the city, and he receives a monthly salary for that work.  The bad thing about that job is that he has to stay awake for long hours, but that is more than compensated by his neighbors, who show him how much they appreciate and respect him for making them feel protected. \r\n\r\nWhen Eliu started out with his store he had many difficulties, since he allowed his neighbors to pay on credit, and then they either didn\u2019t pay him on time or else didn\u2019t pay him the full amount of their debt.  Over time the situation has improved, and Eliu has learned from his experiences.\r\n\r\nThis is Eliu\u2019s sixth loan with MFP, and he appreciates this opportunity and the confidence that has been placed in him.  He promises to make all of his payments on time.  He is grateful to be part of his communal bank, since he has seen that the other members are responsible and supportive individuals.  Eliu will use the amount he has asked for (1500 soles) to purchase more products for his grocery store, as he wants to stock it with a range of products of different brands.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1118373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more products for his grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T01:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":232.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":227.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":247.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":256.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":261.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":274.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.14,"local_amount":459.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":471.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401932},{"amount":94.9,"local_amount":247.56,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":254.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456206},{"amount":98.43,"local_amount":256.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":263.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451871},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":261.27,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":268.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447047},{"amount":105.37,"local_amount":274.89,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":282.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052952}],"funded_date":"2012-07-18T07:30:28Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":438579,"name":"Celina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celina tiene 51 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, con muchas ganas de salir adelante.

Then she found an opportunity to sell cheese from the town of Pivijay in the department of Magdalena, her birthplace. Each time she traveled to make purchases, she observed that there was a potential market for selling a different product that would generate additional income beyond the costs incurred. She then got the idea to sell on credit hand crafted custom sandals made by her brother.\r\n\r\nWith her first Kiva loan, Emis aims to increase her sales not only by buying a larger number of sandals to sell but  she wants to buy a sewing machine motor to repair one she owns and give it to her brother so that he can increase production and expand capacity.  This is a family business in that various members each contribute a little to the business and work arduously so that it grows in space as well as in infrastructure, equipped with good machines, and becomes widely recognized.\r\n\r\nEmis lives with her minor children, aged 16 and 13, for whom she longs to provide a better future, especially with respect to their living conditions because the place where she currently lives is not the best.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1118721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase women's sandals to sell as well as a motor to repair a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emis Arelis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":72748},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78528},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80361},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82236},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84155},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88128},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90184},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92288},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94442},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96645},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":72748,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":74161.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338910},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":78528,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80053.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395461},{"amount":45.92,"local_amount":80361,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81922.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775250},{"amount":47,"local_amount":82236,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83833.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387246},{"amount":103.35,"local_amount":180864,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":184377.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994083},{"amount":44.31,"local_amount":77537,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":79043.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071155},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":182472,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":186017.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527213},{"amount":53.97,"local_amount":94442,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":96276.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927991},{"amount":114.74,"local_amount":200812,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":204713.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705197}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T22:43:50Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":439199,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a fifty-seven-year-old married man with seven children.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan dreams to be able to expand her business. She hopes to be financially free one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1119928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359491},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2811.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303315},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.97,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356037},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":703.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114138}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T07:08:03Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":438410,"name":"Tuvemubujiji \/rbv Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Speciose  fait partie du groupe Tuvemubujiji.

Her business is located in a market, and her primary customers are residents of the nearby estates. She describes her biggest business challenge as the outbreak of diseases that affect the chickens, especially during cold seasons. \r\n\r\nJane will use the loan of 15,000 KES to buy spinning materials to start a new business making carpets to sell.

She is a widow; since the death of her husband, she has been raising 3 children alone. With limited career options because of cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Naghada is one of the many Iraqi woman who work from home, using her sewing skills to generate some additional income to meet the financial needs of herself and her children. \r\n\r\nShe has 6 years' experience with her sewing and tailoring. Trying to improve her work and opportunities, she would like to buy a small generator, an over machine, an iron stand, and some fabric. The generator will allow her to work even during the hours the power is off - which happens frequently in her city - while the other items will help her offer a better variety of services for her customers.\r\n\r\nIn order to make these purchases, Naghada took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Al momento de ir a realizar sus faenas de pesca lleva consigo ropa, la cual vende en los centros poblados que est\u00e1n ubicados cerca de las riberas de los r\u00edos; de esa manera genera un ingreso adicional.\nLe gusta mucho lo que hace porque adora estar en contacto con la naturaleza, disfrutar de la belleza de los r\u00edos, dedicar su tiempo a lo que mejor sabe hacer y contribuye a la conservaci\u00f3n de las especies, es por ello que no le agrada ver que otros pescadores, con ambici\u00f3n de riqueza, realizan su trabajo contaminando los r\u00edos o capturan especies no permitidas y de tama\u00f1os peque\u00f1os que no han realizado su etapa de reproducci\u00f3n. Su meta es conseguir un puesto fijo en alg\u00fan mercado de su localidad.\n\nEste es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por tanto agradece la oportunidad y confianza que ponen en ella. Por otro lado, se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de manera puntual. Y adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte del banco comunal al que pertenece, ya que ha visto que sus integrantes son personas responsables y solidarias.\nEl monto solicitado (S\/. 1000) lo invertir\u00e1 en su negocio de pesca con la compra de redes nuevas, algunas trampas y hielo que utiliza para la conservaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"Julia, 39, is an enterprising, supportive, hard-working woman.  She has been divorced many years from her husband, with whom she had three children, ages 23, 18 and 16.  She lives with them in her own house and makes every effort to give them the best quality of life possible.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling fresh and salted fish.  She works daily or weekly at the main markets in the city.  The quantity of fish and frequency of sale depends strictly on the daily fishing activity in the city rivers.  Her brothers help out by collaborating and fishing the species that are in highest demand and the best size, always respecting the fishing season.  She has been in business for many years and the income is very advantageous, since sometimes she triples the initial investment.  When she goes out to sell fish sometimes she takes clothing to sell in the villages on the riverbanks, which is an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nShe likes what she does because she is in contact with nature, enjoying the beauty of the rivers, spending time doing what she does best and contributing to species preservation.  That is why she does not like seeing other fisherman who only want to get rich, contaminating the rivers and capturing small sized, illegal species.  Her goal is to have a permanent stall at the village market.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity and trust placed in her.  She is also committed to paying the loan back on time.  She enjoys belonging to her communal bank because she sees all the members as being responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nThe loan in the amount of 1,000 PEN will be used to buy new nets, traps and ice for preservation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1118099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy new nets, traps and ice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T08:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T08:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":147.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":159.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":183.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.19,"local_amount":147.17,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":147.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099018},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":159.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":159.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401910},{"amount":62.02,"local_amount":165.39,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":165.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456184},{"amount":62.45,"local_amount":166.53,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451850},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":177.76,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":178.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447025},{"amount":68.89,"local_amount":183.71,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":184.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052930}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T18:39:36Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":434418,"name":"Aryan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aryan is 32 years old.

She is married and has three children, ages 21, 18 and 13.  They are a close-knit family who all live together in their own house which they bought through hard work and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHer job consists of selling beauty products such as perfumes, cosmetics and personal care items.  She works alone and sells directly to her customers, most of whom are neighbors, friends and relatives.  She also sells to her work colleagues, since she works for a state company.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys what she does because it generates an additional income for the family, making it easier to pay bills on time.  When she started the business there were some difficulties, such as not having the power of conviction regarding the quality of the products, taking longer to make a sale.  But finally this barrier was overcome and she is now an excellent salesperson.  She has many plans for the future, among which is improving her business by setting up a small shop in her home.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan through MFP and she is grateful to those who are allowing her to continue toward her goals.  Also, she is very committed, once again, to paying back the loan on time, as she did previously.  She is happy about belonging to her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and supportive.\r\n\r\nThe loan in the amount of 1,500 PEN will be used to buy beauty products to increase her inventory and obtain more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1118103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T08:40:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":248.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":249.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":266.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":274.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.4,"local_amount":460.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":472.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401911},{"amount":95.16,"local_amount":248.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":254.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456185},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":249.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451851},{"amount":102.27,"local_amount":266.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":273.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447026},{"amount":105.35,"local_amount":274.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":281.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052931}],"funded_date":"2012-07-18T22:57:38Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":438431,"name":"Twifatanye \/rbv Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Christine  fait partie du groupe Twifatanye.

As Aby knows from her vast experience of 20 years, fashion is cyclical and there are always new trends.  So she always wants to be able to meet the demands of her special customers.

She is a married Iraqi woman and a mother of two children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Shna is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Shna qualified for a home improvement loan, which she successfully repaid to Relief International - Microfinance Iraq. She is now taking advantage of a business loan to improve her sewing\/tailoring activities. \r\n\r\nShe has eight years experience in meeting the needs of her customers, making dresses and other fabric household items. With the loan, she plans to improve both her work conditions and the services she is offering. She would like to purchase a small generator to be able to work at the frequent times when the power is out. She would also like to purchase an A\/C unit, some small furniture items for her work area and an iron.  \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

Seeking an additional source of income for her family back in 2000, Kaliya set up her business of producing national handmade felt carpets (shyrdak) with 5,000 som (KGS). Having created their own group and set up the production by means of joint efforts in material purchasing and work from home, the Group's monthly income from the sale of their products amounts to nearly 20,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Kaliya turned to the organization Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase necessary carpet fibers and materials. Kaliya and the Group are planning on investing the earnings from the loan into the further business expansion and purchase a sewing machine to make Kyrgyz national hats

She plans to add more goats to the existing ones, hoping to increase her income in order to support her family better.  She is the only moneymaker in her family of five.  People who referred her to our institution said that she is a very responsible and a hard-working person.  She never stops working, to generate income; accommodate her daughter; take care of the younger ones, the garden, the goats; and so on.\r\n\r\nFiqirete is very grateful to the Kiva lenders and VisionFund Albania.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nI have been working in Tanzania with my wife for four years now, and I have been using my previous project management experience to help in the development of new projects in this rural part of Tanzania. We have a son living in Sweden and a daughter back in Australia. The very limited access to electricity supply, especially in remote areas such as Kagera, means that solar lighting presents opportunities for people to study and work in the evenings, helping to reduce poverty. They also avoid the need to use dangerous kerosene lamps, reducing costs, improving health and reducing the risk of fires. A large part of my work for the Anglican Church over the last year was starting a retail business to sell solar lights locally and distribute them to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses who want to sell them in villages. We have also trained new staff and provided employment locally and aim to develop a self-sustaining enterprise. \r\n\r\nWatu na Nuru needs to have sufficient quantities of the right products at the best time of year (when farmers bring in their harvest). We need funds to ensure product is available when people are ready to buy it. We have developed a partnership with Barefoot Power Australia, who make what we believe are the best micro-solar systems on the market. When we are not selling product, we provide training and technical support to retailers and micro-entrepreneurs because we want to ensure these lights continue working for years. My greatest challenge in this role is maintaining supply lines to the remote areas in a region the size of Rwanda. Your loan will support our stock so that more village entrepreneurs can sell these lighting solutions. My favourite part of this job is hearing our customers tell us what a huge difference solar has made in their lives!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":25375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25375,"image":{"id":1090125,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2587,"youtubeId":"5raS6LsRpIM","title":"Kiva Borrower Andy from Tanzania","thumbnailImageId":1090125},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy stock of micro-solar lighting kits from a Barefoot Power wholesaler","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Ngara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T17:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T17:30:19Z","loan_amount":25375,"lender_count":805,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":40000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":25375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":28000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7612.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7612.5,"local_amount":12000000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-25T08:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12004912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355756909},{"amount":17762.5,"local_amount":28000000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28011462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390497257}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T01:42:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:02:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":438671,"name":"Gabriela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gabriela es socia del Bancomunal Llapanchik y tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y  madre tres hijos (un var\u00f3n y 2 mujeres).

They have two young children, one of whom is currently attending elementary school.  Pedro and his family reside in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in the coastal province of Esmeraldas.  This area is known for its abundance of plant and animal life due to the tropical weather conditions and the presence of a dense rain forest.  The residents of this province have made considerable progress, thanks in part to the creation of various access roads that lead to the river.  Just a few years ago, there was only one access road that could reach these towns.  The residents of this canton engage primarily in farming activities, specifically the cultivation of oil palms, bananas, and passion fruit.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 10 years, Pedro has been growing oil palms and other traditional products of the region.  Not only has he been able to help his family get ahead, but he has also provided occasional work to people with limited resources.  Pedro wants to strengthen his plantation by purchasing seeds and fertilizers, which is why he is requesting this loan.  He hopes to improve the quality of life for himself and his family.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis dream is to continue working the land.  In the future, he hopes to provide stable jobs to those residents who want to improve their socioeconomic conditions.

Her husband is Sammy, a salesman. She is the mother of four children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAurea operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling the items by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 40,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAurea hopes her business would grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

However, the family primarily earns a living through agricultural activities.  They have two milking cows and a calf.  They produce cheese and sell it on the local open market. They also own a plot of land, where greens are grown and a vineyard is located.  Bezhan and his son make wine in the autumn and sell it in nearby villages.

The group's representative, Victoire, is the one in the photo with her hand raised. She is 47 years old and lives in Benin. She no longer lives with her husband. She has four children, all with schooling. One of the children remains in her care. \r\n\r\nTo cope with her needs and those of a child still in her care, Victoire has been selling bananas and palm via the distribution system for fifteen years.
