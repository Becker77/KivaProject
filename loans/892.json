He is a farmer who has been growing tobacco for 15 years. He went to school up to junior high school, and is now the father of five grown-up children. He says his first loan was a great help because it could cover the cost of supplies and the rental of land to grow tobacco, which generated a good crop. His first loan was used for the purchase supplies and labour payment so that he was able to sow five manzanas (8.6 acres) of tobacco. He wants to improve production and offer better quality produce this year, which is why today he requires a second loan. This time he will invest in the repair and maintenance of a tobacco-drying gallery. This will help him improve the quality of his produce, and the development is supported by his children as well as by Kiva. He hopes to have the support of Kiva to keep your business growing, to cover the tobacco production costs, generate more income and to move forward with his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1119216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To invest in the repair and maintenance of a tobacco-drying room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T06:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T06:40:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166193}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T04:46:02Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":439754,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan works hard to support her family.

The loan will be used to buy more dry food like maize for resale and will help Stanly to generate greater profits and pay her school fees for his children. Stanly hopes that in the future he will be able to educate his children up to the university level. \n\nStanly is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She is 54 years old.  Aurora is a very hard-working person who strives to provide for her children and offer them with a better life.  She uses her old artisanal oven and bundles of firewood to try and earn a daily living.\r\n\r\nAurora has been making bread and 'rosquillas' (a type of doughnut) for 25 years.  She only studied up to the fifth year of her primary education as her family's financial situation didn't allow her to continue.  Aurora is the mother of five children, two of whom are still in her care.  She started out in this business when she was very young, helping her mom who worked in the same business.  In this way, she gained experience and skill.  After she got married, she decided to work for herself.  At the age of 29, she set up her own business selling 'rosquillas', 'rosquetes' (a type of large doughnut) and bread.  \r\n\r\nThrough her hard work and effort, Aurora now has regular customers who come to her modest home to buy her products.  She has the support of her children who help her to make her bread and 'rosquillas'.  She also has additional income which her husband makes working for a company and which he puts towards their household expenses.  Aurora sells her products in her own community and also to itinerant vendors in the area though she would love to be able to sell them to the supermarkets because they pay a better price.\r\n\r\nAurora would like to be able to diversify the products that she sells in order to meet her customers' needs.  She is requesting this loan to buy raw materials such as corn, cheese and salt, the supplies she needs for making her 'rosquillas'.  She believes that the loan will be helpful as she will be able to make her products well and deliver them on time to her customers.  This will make her more profits.  Her future plans are to improve her home, be in a better financial position, and get ahead  in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1119200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials such as corn, cheese and salt","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora Del Rosario \t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":848,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-21T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613468},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-19T08:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":70.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452940},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":70.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":70.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448988},{"amount":92.03,"local_amount":91.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":92.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443849},{"amount":81.02,"local_amount":80.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048797},{"amount":79.82,"local_amount":79.63,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":79.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005958},{"amount":384.62,"local_amount":383.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":384.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568742}],"funded_date":"2012-06-21T08:03:38Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":439288,"name":"Ernesto","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Casado e pai de 7 filhos dos quais 6 frequentam a Escola, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria com a sua fam\u00edlia e n\u00e3o sustenta mais ningu\u00e9m.\nTrabalha como padeiro e tem um neg\u00f3cio pr\u00f3prio de venda de produtos diversos, com o presente empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar produtos (cervejas, arroz, \u00f3leo, a\u00e7\u00facar, sab\u00e3o, e outros) para aumentar a quantidade da sua mercadoria.\nNo futuro pretende adquirir uma viatura para facilitar o escoamento dos produtos para o seu estabelecimento, para tal compromete-se a pagar devidamente o empr\u00e9stimo para solicitar mais a Hluvuku. \nO desafio \u00e9 o alto custo de vida e os pre\u00e7os elevados dos produtos.\n\n","en":"Ernesto is married and the father of 7 children, 6 of whom attend School.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCrisanta dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1120867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 48 years old, unmarried, and lives with her mother and two nieces (12 and 14 years old). The children go to school. Her sister lives and works abroad to assist the family financially, and Maguli takes care of her pensioner mother and nieces. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for buying a business, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a milk cow. Maguli produces yogurt and sells it in the village. Also the family gets a small amount of financial assistance from Maguli\u2019s sister. The total average monthly income of the family doesn\u2019t exceed 400 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, Maguli\u2019s family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nMaguli requested a loan from Credo to start a small business. Her loan request was approved via the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program includes business start-up and re-startup loans with conditions appropriate for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nMaguli already has constructed a building for the grocery store in front of the family home. With the loan, she will purchase inventories for the store and meet her first customers. Maguli will work as a salesperson herself. She will sell a variety of grocery products, including dairy products from their cow. She is sure that the store will function profitably, as there are no similar stores nearby. The new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.

The city is in the process of growth resulting from ecotourism in the area.  The main attraction is \"La Cascada Azul\" (The Blue Waterfall), which is located 140 kilometers from the capital of Quito.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite its geographical location in the Ecuadorian mountains, Puerto Quito experiences weather that is very similar to that along the coast.  Since it is located in a tropical rain forest, the highest temperatures in the province reach approximately 25\u00b0C.  The temperature and the atmospheric conditions provide a suitable environment for the cultivation of tropical products.  \r\n<p>\r\nPatricia decided to grow cacao since it is a tradition that was passed on to her by her father.  For the past four years, she and her husband have managed a plantation where they grow and harvest cacao.  This 25-year-old entrepreneur strives each day to move her family forward.  She lives with her two-year-old son and her husband \u00c1ngel, age 28, who helps each day with the work around their plantation.  Patricia spends around six hours each day looking after her cacao plants.  After her work day is finished, she focuses on taking care of her family.  She enjoys spending time with them and sharing unforgettable moments.  Her plantation is located almost 10 minutes from her house, so it is easy for her to get to work.  The most difficult part of the production process is the fumigation of the plants.

For the past two years Ruth has been working hard to manage her small hotel where she also offers meals. \r\n<p>\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. She will use her loan to buy more fresh food for her dishes. Greater profits will mean that Ruth can buy more plates and cups and stock up on more food for the hotel. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to buy goats to start a livestock concern. \r\n<p>\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Ruth's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1120937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"stock

The family lives together in their own home which they managed to build as a result of their hard work, with help from their parents.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business is selling groceries and drinks.  She set up her business in her home and there she has a refrigerator that she bought with the support of her partner.  She uses it to keep the drinks and iced treats that she sells cold.  She also equipped a small store where she offers all kinds of groceries and basic household products.  Every day she serves her customers from very early in the morning and with a great deal of kindness.  She has been working in this business for one year and sometimes receives support from her sister-in-law.  Mar\u00eda enjoys what she does as it allows her to work from home and also have time free so that she can look after her young daughter.  In addition, it gives her extra income which allows her to support her partner with their household expenses.  She would like to continue making progress in this way so that she can provide her daughter with a better quality of life.  As things are going well, she has plans to continue developing her business and to increase the range of products she sells.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's third loan from MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support because it makes her feel more certain of being able to make progress in her work.  Once again, Mar\u00eda pledges to make her repayments on time as she has in the past.  She is very happy to belong to her community bank because all the members are very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use the loan for 1,500 soles that she has requested to buy a wider variety of groceries and drinks.  In this way, she plans to keep all her customers happy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1119676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase the merchandise in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":234.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":226.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":247.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":256.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":260.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":274.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":176.7,"local_amount":460.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":471.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401968},{"amount":94.8,"local_amount":247.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":252.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456243},{"amount":98.33,"local_amount":256.52,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":262.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451907},{"amount":100.04,"local_amount":260.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":266.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447082},{"amount":105.13,"local_amount":274.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":280.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052988}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T03:10:19Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":439899,"name":"P.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulina is a 48-year-old widow.

She is a very hardworking woman with a big desire to better herself. She is currently separated from the man with whom she shared her days for a lot of years, she has 9 children, who are all grown up. She lives in a house of her own, which she got as a result of her relationship and shares it with just one of her daughters. They both put a lot of effort into trying to have a comfortable life. She fishes for a living. In order to do it, she has a small boat equipped with the necessary tools and accessories. She fishes in areas that are close to the city or in some rivers of which she already knows the resources that they carry. She directs her work towards obtaining the species that are consumed the most, those that are of the largest sizes and those that are better priced in the market, always respecting the close season of the species that are in danger of extinction or in reproductive period. When she has the fish, she sells it in her locality's central market herself, and with the help of some of her children. She sells at wholesale, to temporary or street vendors. She has been doing this for 40 years and acknowledges that it is a very profitable activity for the revenue that it generates. Also, she likes doing it, because it is her source of income. She says that thanks to this trade she has been able to lead a quiet and comfortable life. For this reason, she has plans to venture into the business of river transportation of passengers, and plans to build a special boat for this activity. This is her loan number 7 with MPF, which is why she is thankful for the people who make it possible for her to pursue her goals. On the other hand, she is very committed, once again, to make her repayments on time, as she did before. And she is very happy to be a part of her communal bank, since all the members are very kind, nice and supportive people. The amount requested (S\/. 2000) will be invested into making small repairs to the boat she currently owns and will make a down payment to get the other boat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1119680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to fix her current boat and make a down payment to purchase a new one","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T19:40:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paquita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":311.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":302.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":329.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":341.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":347.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":367.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":230.28,"local_amount":614.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":614.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401969},{"amount":123.55,"local_amount":329.45,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":329.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456244},{"amount":128.15,"local_amount":341.73,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":341.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451908},{"amount":130.38,"local_amount":347.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":347.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447083},{"amount":137.64,"local_amount":367.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":367.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052989}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T05:19:06Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marina Romanisio","image":903469}},{"id":439907,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.

She is an industrious farmer who always takes care of her crops in the field in order to ensure a high production so that she can send all of her children to school.

Lleva en esta actividad 2 a\u00f1os y a pesar de la dificultad que encuentra en el traslado de sus art\u00edculos afirma que su esfuerzo lo puede ver recompensando en las ganancias que le quedan. A su vez, por las ma\u00f1anas es profesora en una escuela ubicada cerca de su casa y se siente tranquila porque los ingresos que obtiene de ambos trabajos le han permitido ir cumpliendo algunas metas que se ha trazado.

For the past year, Margret has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. Margaret will use the loan to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar, and soap for resale, and will help her to generate greater profits. She hopes that in the future she will be able to buy cows and build a house. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Margret's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Her primary tool is her great charisma and her eloquence in gaining access to the customers.  During the ten years that she has done the work she has learned a lot about managing it and about the fishing seasons.\r\n\r\nShe went from not knowing anything about what she did to becoming an excellent administrator of her business.  She always receives good income for her work.  In the future she hopes to get a sales stand at a market.  After that she hopes to get her first fishing boat.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that has been placed in her.  She pledges to make her payments punctually.  It pleases her to be part of the communal bank that she belongs to because the members are responsible and supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 500 soles to buy the species of fish that are most requested.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1119775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T21:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T21:00:14Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":78.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":87.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.22,"local_amount":78.06,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":83.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099042},{"amount":30.25,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401974},{"amount":32.98,"local_amount":82.45,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456249},{"amount":34.21,"local_amount":85.52,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":91.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451913},{"amount":34.81,"local_amount":87.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":92.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447088},{"amount":36.53,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":97.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052994}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T22:12:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":439980,"name":"Yen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yen is requesting a new loan to buy a greater variety and quantity of products, such as toothpaste, shampoos, and personal sanitary items to sell in her store.

She is a happy, friendly woman with a lot of business experience. Her partner Dennis, 54, is a fisherman. She lives with her parents, her partner and her two children, who are 19 and 16 years old. They live in a house that she, with the support of her partner, succeeded in building after many years of working.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s business involves the sale of fish. She has a fishing boat which she takes to a river or lake, together with her partner and two helpers as well as all the fishing gear they need to do good work. Later she sells the catch, wholesale, to a market in the city.  She has been doing this work for 20 years. Moreover, she has discovered in this routine an opportunity to sell second hand clothing because in the surrounding areas adjacent to the rivers where she fishes, the settlers ask her for garments. She buys clothing in commercial centers in the city and then sells it at each village she visits. She has had this business for two years.  She enjoys both businesses since they keep her busy. However what she does not like, she says, is that sometimes she fails to catch enough to cover expenses, often due to a lack of fish or the rising rivers, but that does not discourage her.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen\u2019s second loan from MFP, therefore she is grateful to those who make it possible.

It is very difficult to treat the land, and this is why Victor decided to purchase mechanized farming equipment for plowing and cutting the land in a greenhouse.  He needs a generator in case the supply of electricity is interrupted.  Victor dreams of getting involved in growing strawberries in a greenhouse and also of expanding his land plot.  His personal plans include developing his business by building two more greenhouses on new land plots.

Se encuentra separada hace muchos a\u00f1os de quien fue su pareja, con la que tuvo cuatro hijos, siendo dos de ellos ya mayores de edad. Vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus dos menores hijos en la casa que le dej\u00f3 su ex pareja. \n\nSu actividad es la venta de abarrotes en general y bebidas, para eso estableci\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en su vivienda, ah\u00ed atiende todos los d\u00edas, desde muy temprano, de manera amable y cordial a todos sus clientes, que en su mayor\u00eda son sus vecinos, con quienes tiene una relaci\u00f3n de amistad y respeto durante los 6 a\u00f1os que viene funcionando su bodega. Generalmente atiende sola, pero en ocasiones recibe la ayuda de su hija. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n desde hace un a\u00f1o trabaja por las noches en la atenci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico en un restaurante de su ciudad, ambos trabajos le generan los ingresos necesarios para poder llevar una vida confortable para ella y sus hijos. Le agrada su negocio  de ventas de abarrotes ya que le permite estar en casa durante el d\u00eda y participar en las actividades escolares de su hija y de su hogar. As\u00ed mismo, el ingreso econ\u00f3mico que obtiene le ayuda a solventar los gastos b\u00e1sicos, ya que con la pensi\u00f3n alimenticia que recibe mensualmente de su ex pareja no lograba cubrir todos los gastos familiares, por ello decidi\u00f3 trabajar para no seguir pasando necesidades.

She has been separated for many years from the father of her four children, two of whom are already adults. She lives with her two younger children in the house that her ex-husband left her.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of groceries and drinks, for which she established a small shop in her residence. Starting very early, she helps all her customers there every day in a friendly and cordial way. For the most part, her customers are her neighbors, with whom she has had a friendly and respectful relationship for the six years that her store has been in business. She generally works alone, but on occasion her daughter helps her. For the past year, she has also worked evenings serving the public in a restaurant in her city. Both jobs generate the income necessary to be able to provide a comfortable life for herself and her children. She enjoys her grocery-selling business because it allows her to be at home during the day and to participate in the school and household activities of her daughter. Also, the income she makes helps cover basic costs, since the support payments she receives every month from her ex-husband weren't covering all the family's expenses. That's why she decided to work rather than continue doing without. Seeing the good results that she has had to date, she has plans to continue with her business and expand and improve her little store.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan with MFP and Sonia is very happy to know that she has financial support; that way she will feel more sure of continuing with her work. She also commits, once again, to repaying her loan punctually like she did before. In addition, she is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since all the members are very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount (1000 PEN), Sonia will purchase a greater quantity of different products and groceries in order to offer a better selection to her customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1119687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-20T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-20T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":155.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":164.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":173.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":183.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.16,"local_amount":307.08,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":307.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401971},{"amount":61.77,"local_amount":164.74,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":164.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456246},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":170.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451910},{"amount":65.19,"local_amount":173.86,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":173.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447085},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":183.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052991}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T19:53:53Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":440025,"name":"Ekaterine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekaterine is 35 years old.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamar has requested credit for starting up a sales business. The family owns an old small truck, which Tamar and Peter will use for the business. With the requested credit, Tamar will purchase seasonal fruits and vegetables from local farmers and take them with the truck to nearby towns for sale. Tamar will sell the products with a price mark-up and get the profit. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented with the assistance of Kiva, the family will get more income. Tamar will be able to assist her children financially and improve her family's living conditions. She plans to increase the volume of trade gradually by reinvesting part of the profit into business.

She lives with them in the house she inherited from her parents. \r\n\r\nShe set up a space in her house for her business that serves as a sewing studio.  She sews different kinds of dresses, blouses, pants for women and for men, lingerie, and suits for special occasions.  She is very detail-oriented and she is able to express this in her garments, which is reflected in her customers' satisfaction.  She has been in this business for almost 15 years and she has always worked alone.  She has also included the sale of drinks (beer and sodas) into her business.  She started this part of her business one year ago, also out of her home.  She loves the sewing work she does, though she had problems initially because she did not make garments to her clientele's taste.  However, now she is like a stylist who always has suggestions for her customers.  This allows her to handle her business well and she is always able to please her customers.  Nevertheless, even though she makes what they like and she makes money from it, she still wants to grow her beverages business little by little as, in the future, she hopes to set up a small bar and thereby solidify another source of income for her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP and she is thankful for the opportunity they are offering her and the confidence they have in her.

This is a family business that is over 20 years old, but she started managing it about 5 years ago.  When she started, she had many fears and doubts, but with time and the support of her two employees, she was able to get over them and now her small restaurant is one of the most popular and frequented in the city.  It is going very well for her and she is very happy, mostly because she was able buy the land her business is now on after many years of renting the space.  Since she has worked here, she has been able to contribute to her household income and, thanks to that, her financial situation has improved greatly.

Annet is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children who are all currently in school. For the past three years, Annet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of  700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Annet generate greater profits to pay school fees for her children. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house on it. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Annet's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget.

Sometimes, also, together with his family he likes to eat one of his favorite dishes, the delicious \u201carroz con pollo\u201d, chicken with rice.  His parents are very humble people but thanks to their effort, they could give him a profession which is nursing.\r\n\r\nAlver rises very early in the morning to be able to open his business of selling bananas.  He works around 9 hours per day and can see up to 15 customers each day.  He is very charismatic and he feels that his business is going well because his customers always go home contented and well taken care of.\r\n\r\nAlver is very happy and grateful with the loans from Kiva since thanks to the help, he will buy a small piece of land for himself where he can plant his own fruit that he sells.  This will allow him to have his own orchards and thus improve his income since he won\u2019t have to buy fruit from other farmers.  Then he will be able to continue working and fighting each day to turn his big dream into reality.  This is \u201cto give his children a good education and to have a bigger business and a large parcel of land to grow his fruit trees\u201d.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1118020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She also likes to cook one of her favorite dishes which is very delicious \u201cArroz con Pato\u201d [Rice with duck]. Because of the limited economic resources of her parents, Nelly was only able to study through high school, but she would have liked to study nursing. \r\n\r\nEvery day, Nelly gets up very early to go work in her business of selling flowers.  She works approximately 10 hours a day and can attend up to 30 customers a day.  She is always very kind and because of this she believes she does well in her business because her customers always leave happy and also because she is very honest and very creative in making the flower arrangements. \r\n\r\nNelly is very happy and very grateful for the help she has received from the Kiva loans.

With this she will be able to improve her earnings and will have a greater variety of flowers especially for Father\u2019s Day because during this time there are a greater number of customers.  She will keep working with the joy and desire that she is known for so that she can keep fighting to accomplish her greatest dream: \u201cTo build a home with good materials and to have another stall

flowers.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1120194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Salvador, a carpenter, and is a mother. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCorazon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

Today, after seven loans from Hekima, her own capital amounts to $600 (loans excluded).\n\nThis new loan will be used to buy ten dozen plates in melamine and plastic, as well as saucepans. She would like to see her children grow and complete their studies, and she would like to become a wholesaler in the future.\n\nShe therefore thanks Hekima for its actions and pray that God may bless it even more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1120981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy ten dozen plates and saucepans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

En 1978, Quito fue nombrado Primer Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad por la UNESCO por un paisaje que combina naturaleza e infraestructura de una manera \u00fanica en su categor\u00eda.

She lives in Solanda with her husband and daughter.  This is a neighborhood in the south of Quito, the capital of Ecuador.  The city of Quito is located on the Andean mountain range, 2,800 meters above sea level.  It is the third highest capital city in the world.  In 1978, Quito was named the first World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its landscape which combines nature and infrastructure in a unique way in its category.

Lorena finished high school but couldn't continue her education as her daughter was born and she had to work hard to provide for her well-being.  This is what motivated her to open her business and what motivates her to continue growing it.  She is requesting this Kiva loan so that she can buy and sell more materials and to get people to help her in transporting it all because it is very heavy for her to do alone.  In this way, she will be able to provide her daughter with a better future and buy her own house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1120320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoe materials to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-21T15:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-21T15:00:23Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":81.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":93.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":96.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.46,"local_amount":77.89,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":78.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334567},{"amount":81.99,"local_amount":81.4,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390490},{"amount":83.59,"local_amount":82.98,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149481},{"amount":85.72,"local_amount":85.1,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":85.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382604},{"amount":86.87,"local_amount":86.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":86.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989693},{"amount":88.97,"local_amount":88.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":88.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126102},{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":89.62,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516703},{"amount":98.65,"local_amount":97.93,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":98.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068568},{"amount":91.28,"local_amount":90.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":91.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494843},{"amount":289.2,"local_amount":287.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":289.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524775}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T04:17:39Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":440361,"name":"Linh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linh is a 39 year-old, married woman with two children.

He believes it will increase his family income notably.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the smoky and extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars on the natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Ochirbat is taking will be used to cover the cost of his buying a car which uses natural gas.

With her Kiva loan she will buy bundles of wheat flour, sugar, maize flour, an beans which are in high demand. Her loan should be successful because her sales are based on customer orders. What she buys has a fast turnover, which causes her working capital to turn quickly and therefore increase her profits.

Jolly is 17 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Jolly has been working hard to manage her small hotel, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jolly has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food for cooking, and will help Jolly to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Jolly hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build on it. \r\n\r\nJolly is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jolly's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

nomadic yurt. They live on her father-in-law\u2019s land in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. They are a young couple who have recently started living separately from their parents. Solongo is a young, energetic woman with a desire to create new and big things. Her husband is a taxi driver. She has been working in a small company as an architect for one year, and has gained a lot of experience. Mongolia is a rapidly developing country in Asia; the proof is skyscraping cranes located everywhere in Ulaanbaatar. Construction projects are promising a huge profit and dozens of companies are building apartments. Solongo doesn\u2019t have enough time for her family, because the company where she works has plenty of work to be done. For this reason, she works at the company from morning till night. Solongo is requesting a 1,500,000 MNT loan to purchase a PC with new software so she can do some of her work at home. This will enable her to spend more time with her family.

She is married to a humble farmer and has four married children. All of them are independent and live separately. However far they live away from their parents, they often get in touch and come to visit their old parents. Even though Tang recently received financial support from her children, she doesn't completely depend on her children. Tang, at her age, still works hard to generate income for herself. She sells breakfast and lunch to people around her neighborhood, earning approximately $4.00 per day. \r\n\r\nOne of Tang's daughters sells vegetables in a local market of the Baray district, Kompong Tom.
