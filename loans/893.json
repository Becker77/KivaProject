While his mother spends her time as a homemaker, Alex works seven hours each day on his property.  In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his son.  He strives each day to help his family move forward.  The most difficult part of his job is cleaning the areas where the pigs are housed because he must perform all of the work by himself.  He hopes to increase the number of animals on his property so that he can improve his income.  Alex dreams of expanding his business and having his own enterprise.  His only inspiration is the happiness of his son, for whom he tries to provide the very best.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1120129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy piglets.

city, Mongolia. (A 'ger' is a traditional Mongolian tent.) The district lacks basic infrastructure. He is a teacher at a local college. \r\n\r\nRecently he moved from his old location to a new yard and is building a dormitory with 9 rooms. Besides his teaching job he is building the dormitory by himself. This shows that he is a very hardworking and ambitious man.  \r\n\r\nHe has already finished 4 rooms and wishes to finish the last 5 as quickly. Therefore he is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) loan to purchase essential construction materials to finish his dormitory in order to rent to others who want to rent.  Plus his current yard and dormitory is located in a very good place, so he is happy for it. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1122165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy essential construction materials in order to finish a dormitory.

She currently lives in a home that she purchased after many years of setting aside daily savings.  Zoila lives with her entire family and together they strive each day to achieve financial success and the fulfillment of their dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer business involves selling fast food and traditional dishes of the region (such as roasted meats and plantains).  Every day, in the early hours of the morning, she heads out to the market in the city in order to buy all of the ingredients that she needs for preparing her dishes, which are sold from the sidewalk in front of her house beginning at 4pm.  Her kitchen is equipped with a slow-burning fire pit for roasting the meat.  She also has two tables set up, one for displaying all of her dishes and the other with four chairs for seating her guests.  The exceptional flavor of her dishes makes her food stand a necessary stop for customers who want to satisfy their hunger.  Zoila has been in this line of work for four years and has had the help and constant support of her daughter from the very beginning.  Both of them work nonstop.  On an occasional basis, Zoila also sells clothing in the remote areas of the city.  She has been doing this for eight months.  What she enjoys about her job is being able to stay at home since she does not have to travel to another place to generate sales.  She appreciates being able to generate her own income by doing something that she enjoys, which is cooking.  Going forward, she hopes to establish a restaurant where she can better serve her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 11th loan with MFP.  Zoila is grateful for this opportunity and the trust that has been demonstrated to her once again.  She promises to complete her payments on time and appreciates being part of her Communal Bank, where all of the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  The loan amount of 2,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy the necessary ingredients for continuing her business.  She will also buy a few articles of clothing for her other business.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1119790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for her food business and a few articles for her clothing business.

reside en la ciudad de Quito en el sector de la Magdalena. Quito es la capital del Ecuador y est\u00e1 situada en la cordillera de los Andes a 2.800 metros sobre el nivel del mar, haci\u00e9ndola la 3era capital m\u00e1s alta del mundo. En 1978, Quito fue nombrada Primer Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad por la UNESCO por un paisaje que combina naturaleza e infraestructura de una manera \u00fanica en su categor\u00eda. Quito se divide en tres partes: el Centro Hist\u00f3rico; donde se preserva el Quito colonial, el Norte; donde tradicionalmente se sit\u00faan las clases socioecon\u00f3micas altas, y el Sur; conocido como \u201cel lado pobre\u201d de la ciudad. \nFederico lleva un largo trayecto envuelto en la m\u00fasica, ya que su familia tiene gran conocimiento sobre este arte. Para mejorar su t\u00e9cnica musical daba clases a cambio de que la gente le prestase sus instrumentos y de esta manera empez\u00f3 su negocio como profesor de m\u00fasica en el cual ya lleva trabajando 10 a\u00f1os. Federico vive con sus dos hijos peque\u00f1os y sue\u00f1a con darles un futuro prometedor. Por el momento, sus ingresos no le permiten mantenerse solo y necesita el apoyo econ\u00f3mico de sus familiares. Por lo tanto,  \u00e9l quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo a Kiva para comprar un terreno o piso donde construir\u00e1 un local donde pueda dar sus clases, incrementar el n\u00famero de clientes y poder mejora su calidad de vida y la de sus hijos.","en":"Federico was born in Ecuador's northern Sierra region in 1956, but he lives in the Magdalena neighborhood of Quito now.  Quito is the capital of Ecuador.  It is 2,800 meters above sea level which makes it the world's 3rd highest capital.  In 1978, the city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site because it combines a beautiful natural setting with exceptional infrastructure.  Quito is divided in three parts: the colonial city, known as the Historic Center or colonial city; the North, the traditionally well-off neighborhoods; and the South, the \"poor side\" of town.  \r\nFederico comes from a family that is steeped in music and was born to be a muscian.  To improve his technique, he used to give music lessons in exchange for the musical instruments he had to borrow, an arrangement that ultimately led to a career as a music teacher, work that he's been doing for 10 years now.  Federico lives with his two young children and tells us that he wants to provide the best possible future for them.  He doesn't make enough now to support himself so he relies on help from his extended family.  He wants to increase his earnings and he's applying to Kiva for a loan so that he can buy land where he can build a studio for music classes.  The investment will help him pick up new customers and, in turn, improve his and his children's quality of life.

comunidad de Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca donde la mayor\u00eda de las personas habla el idioma mixteco.\n\nUno de los integrantes del grupo es el se\u00f1or Florentino de cuarenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad, quien se dedica a trabajar su taxi el cual  pertenece a un sitio llamado Kasandoo ubicado en su localidad. Florentino explica que la palabra \"Kasandoo\" significa \u201ccasa de adobe\u201d en mixteco. \u00c9l lleva trabajando como taxista tres a\u00f1os, y para \u00e9l, han sido los mejores a\u00f1os que ha tenido ya que hace lo que le gusta: ayudar a las personas ofreciendo su servicio o dando un avent\u00f3n a quienes en verdad lo necesitan. Con el objetivo de seguir brindando un buen servicio, Florentino pidi\u00f3 un cr\u00e9dito para darle mantenimiento a su taxi. \n\nPara Don Florentino, una de las mejores experiencias que ha tenido como taxista fue cuando subi\u00f3 a una persona a su taxi y la llev\u00f3 a su destino aunque esta no ten\u00eda dinero para pagar; despu\u00e9s de tiempo, se encontr\u00f3 a la misma persona, exactamente cuando \u00e9l necesitaba a alguien para platicar asuntos personales. Debido a la confianza que gener\u00f3 lo sucedido en el primer encuentro, Don Florentino se sinti\u00f3 c\u00f3modo platicando lo que le suced\u00eda entonces. \n\nDe acuerdo con sus propias palabras, una de las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener una persona para ser taxista es, m\u00e1s que nada, ser honesto ya que ocasiones los pasajeros dejan cosas de valor olvidadas en el taxi y es el momento perfecto donde uno puede practicar sus valores. Don Florentino dice que se considera una persona especial porque le gusta enfrentar las dificultades, ya que desde muy peque\u00f1o ha sabido c\u00f3mo ganarse el pan de cada d\u00eda y lo que cuesta hacerlo pues sus padres son personas son personas de bajos recursos. Adem\u00e1s, en la visita realizada a Florentino, tambi\u00e9n quiso compartir una frase con la que se identifica demasiado: \u201cEn lugar de ser un hombre de \u00e9xito, busca ser un hombre valioso: lo dem\u00e1s llegar\u00e1 naturalmente.\u201d \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son:\n\nFelipe - se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\nH\u00e9ctor Manuel - se dedica a la venta de comida.\nFloriberta - se dedica a la venta  de comida.\nRosa - se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\n\nLe dan las gracias a Vision Fund por ayudar a hombres y mujeres trabajadoras.\n\n\n ","en":"The Monte Negro group is made up of five people from the community of Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca, where most people speak the Mixtec language.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is the 40-year-old Florentino, who works driving a taxi in a place called Kasandoo, located in his area. Florentino explains that the word \"Kasandoo\" means \"adobe house\" in Mixtec. He has worked as a taxi driver for three years, and for him, they have been the best years of his life. Now, he can do what he enjoys: help people by offering his services or giving a ride to those who really need it. With the goal of continuing his good service, Florentino is asking for a loan for maintenance on his taxi.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Florentino, one of the best experiences that he has had as a taxi driver was when he picked up a person in his taxi and brought them to their destination even though they didn't have the money to pay him. After a while, he encountered the same person exactly when he needed to talk to somebody about personal matters. Thanks to the trust created by what happened in the first encounter, Mr. Florentino felt comfortable talking about what happened then.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own words, one of the characteristics that a person should have in order to be a taxi driver is, more than anything, honesty. On occasion, passengers leave valuable things forgotten in the taxi and it's the perfect time for one to practice his\/her virtues. Mr. Florentino says that he considers himself to be a special person because he likes to face difficulties. Since he was a small child, he has known how to earn his daily bread. It was difficult to do because his parents were people of few resources. In addition, in Florentino's visit, he wanted to share a phrase with which he greatly identifies: \"In place of being a successful man, try to be a valuable man. The rest will come naturally.\"\r\n\r\nThe other members in the group are:\r\n\r\nFelipe - works selling traditional corn-based Mexican dishes\r\nHector Manuel - works selling food\r\nFloriberta - works selling food\r\nRosa - works selling traditional corn-based Mexican dishes\r\n\r\nThey give their thanks to Vision Fund for helping working men and women.\r\n\r\n

It is composed of six hardworking and modest members, four women and two men, from a small village called Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca, a place rich in flora and fauna.\n\nOne of the members is Sra. Nancy, who is 47 years old. Do\u00f1a Nancy says that she has been selling flowers and floral arrangements at the market in her area for 13 years. Formerly, she used to sell her flowers in a small village called Ocotl\u00e1n, Oaxaca because her parents are natives of that community. She notes that at the age of seven she stopped attending school so she could sell flowers, a task that nowadays fills her with satisfaction. One of the things she most likes about her business is waiting on customers, which she always does graciously and with a smile.\n\nSome of the kinds of flowers Nancy sells are gladiolas, lilies, the eternal rose and other varieties. She notes that those she sells most are chrysanthemums and roses. She says the characteristics she needs to do her work are creativity and patience in making her floral arrangements, as well as intelligence in choosing the most appropriate flowers for each type of occasion. In addition, Nancy mentions that she considers herself a rather special person because she always likes to be one of the best at her work, thus the competition does not affect her much. In fact, one of the phrases that Do\u00f1a Nancy likes to use to greet her customers is \u201cCome in, come in, look at what we have for you, look at how we pamper you here.\u201d She requested her loan to purchase more flowers and ribbons to continue selling arrangements.\n\nThe other members of the group are:\n\nDominga Gullermina \u2013 sells tacos\nDionicia \u2013 sells fish\nBeda \u2013 sells bread\nDonaciano \u2013 sells groceries\nValeriano Marcelino \u2013 sells chickens.\n\nThey thank the Vision Fund for helping all the hardworking people and for their efforts in helping them obtain loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1112978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy flowers and ribbons for floral arrangements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santiago Jamiltepec Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T00:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T00:30:08Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga Guillermina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donanciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeriano Marcelino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5534.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419145},{"amount":800,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11069.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568731},{"amount":1233.56,"local_amount":16961.42,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":17067.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301400020},{"amount":774.26,"local_amount":10646.12,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10712.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407675},{"amount":792.18,"local_amount":10892.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10960.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120162}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T22:45:20Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":440655,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie is 52 years old.

se\u00f1ora Luisa Raquel, mejor conocida como Do\u00f1a Raquel de cincuenta y dos a\u00f1os. Do\u00f1a Raquel se dedica a la venta de moldes de pl\u00e1stico por cat\u00e1logo desde hace siete a\u00f1os, es vendedora ambulante. Una de las cosas que m\u00e1s le gusta de su negocio es que le deja muy buenas ganancias y cuando ella compra los mismos productos con el distiubuidor, puede llegar a tener descuentos de 30%. Do\u00f1a Raquel emprendi\u00f3 esta actividad gracias a su amiga Cecilia quien la invit\u00f3 a unirse a las ventas por cat\u00e1logo ya que es una forma de administrar su propio tiempo sin descuidar a su hija.\n\nUna de las experiencias m\u00e1s fuertes para Do\u00f1a Raquel, es enfrentar la enfermedad de su hija Claudia de veinticinco a\u00f1os de edad, quien sufre de retraso mental. Do\u00f1a Raquel menciona que su hija Claudia es el motor que la mueve para seguir adelante y enfrentar todo sus obst\u00e1culos. Para Raquel, una de las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener para realizar ventas por cat\u00e1log es ser responsable, amable, tener poder de convencimiento y, sobre todo, ser activa. Adem\u00e1s, dice que se considera una persona especial por enfrentar los problemas con valent\u00eda y por el hecho de que no se deja vencer tan f\u00e1cilmente. Raquel pidi\u00f3 su cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s moldes de pl\u00e1stico para la venta ya que los paquetes que compra le cuestan aproximadamente dos mil cuatrocientos pesos; de esta forma podr\u00e1 tener ejemplares para mostrar y ayudar a convencer a los clientes. \n\nLas otras integrantes del grupo son:\nAdelfa - se dedica a la venta de pan.\nMar\u00eda Adelfa- se dedica a la venta de antojitos mexicanos.\nIdolina- se dedica a la venta de quesos.\nGaudencia- se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00eda de abarrotes.\nElizabeth- se dedica a la venta de comida.\nLuc\u00eda- se dedica a la venta de pan.\nSoledad- se dedica a la venta de quesos.\nRaquel- se dedica a la venta de refrescos.\nCatalina- se dedica a la venta de ropa.\nAna Mar\u00eda- se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00eda de abarrotes.\nRosa-se dedica a la venta de ropa.\nCristina- se dedica a la venta de pl\u00e1sticos.\nAdriana- se dedica a la venta de pan.\n\nTodas ellas le dan las gracias a Vision Fund por ayudarlas a invertir en su negocio y aprovechar mejor sus ganancias.\n\n","en":"This group is named The Jamiltepec Gardenias, it is made up of fourteen indigenous women originally from the state of Oaxaca called Santiago Jamiltepec, a land rich in traditions.\r\n\r\n<p>One of the members of this group is Mrs. Luisa Raquel, better known as Do\u00f1a Raquel, she is 52 years old. Do\u00f1a Raquel has sold plastic molds by catalogue for some 7 years, she is a street vendor. One of the things she enjoys most about her work is very good profits since she buys the products from the distributor and gets up to a 30% discount. Do\u00f1a Raquel started this job thanks to her friend, Cecilia, who invited her to sell items by catalogue since it is a way for her to manage her own time without neglecting her daughter.\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most challenging experiences that Do\u00f1a Raquel has faced is her daughters\u2019 illness. Claudia is 25 years old and is mentally challenged. Do\u00f1a Raquel mentions that her daughter is the motor that drives her to get ahead in life and to face all of her obstacles. For Raquel, one of the characteristics that she has to have for her work is to be a responsible, kind, knowledgeable, and overall active person. She considers herself to be a special person since she faces her problems with courage and does not give up easily. Raquel needs the loan to buy more plastic molds to sell since the packages that she buys cost about twenty-four hundred pesos, she will then have examples to show and which will help her convince customers to buy her products.\r\n\r\n<p>The other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nAdelfa - sells bread\r\nMar\u00eda Adelfa- sells Mexican treats.\r\nIdolina- sells cheese.\r\nGaudencia- sells groceries.\r\nElizabeth- sells food.\r\nLuc\u00eda- sells bread.\r\nSoledad- sells cheese.\r\nRaquel- sells refreshments.\r\nCatalina- sells clothing.\r\nAna Mar\u00eda- sells groceries.\r\nRosa-

Susan intends to overcome this by saving the additional income from the loan and upgrading the type of equipment she uses in her business. \r\n\r\nHer future ambitions include setting up a beauty training college and building her own business premises.

She is widowed with 2 children aged 10 years and 23 years. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Hawa established her Table business (selling local foodstuffs). She sells raw rice, pepper, Maggi food products, salt and palm oil. She started her business because she is a single parent and wants to generate income to support her family. \r\n\r\nShe works 10 hours a day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge in her business is that when there are fewer sales, some perishable goods will deteriorate and the business will run at a loss.\r\n\r\nHawa requires a loan in order to buy more local foodstuffs like raw rice, palm oil, Maggi, pepper and tomato seeds. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, Hawa plans to expand her business to a higher level. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1121267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband is a village pastor, and he helps her support the family with the money he receives from the church. \r\n\r\nElizabeth says that the main challenges in her business are that transportation costs are high and the road network is poor.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has requested a loan in order to buy more bags of charcoal and wood to store, because during the rainy season charcoal will be scarce. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and give her children a good quality education. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to expand her business and build a house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1121227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

She lives in a house that her parents built for her so that she could live with her son and sister.\r\n\r\nSince her son's father left her, Reyna has had her parents' help in obtaining her small rustic house and four plots of land where she sows ginger, annatto and coffee.  \"Ginger, coffee and annatto are very profitable.  They always sell and prices are good\", she says.  However, the disadvantage is that they are harvested once a month.  This means that she must save up and work on a casual basis as a laborer on other plots of land.  Her wish is to ensure that her young son does not want for anything.

For the past 15 years, Margaret has been running a general store inside the market square where she sells dried fish, pepper, bullion cubes, onions, and tomatoes. She began this business to create a permanent source of income to support her family. Margaret buys goods from a wholesaler at 4:00 am and works at her store from 8:00 am through 4:00 pm six days a week. Her major business challenge is transportation to buy fish.\r\n\r\nMargaret is requesting a loan to buy more fish, bullion, and pepper. The extra income from her loan will allow her to start a savings account. In the future, Margaret plans to expand her business and improve her standard of living.

brings to the local market to sell.\r\n \r\nBefore having her own business, Feliza worked in other people's houses washing their clothes. Now she is very happy to run her own small business.\r\n\r\nFeliza leaves her house very early in the morning to work in her fields, carrying her one-year old daughter on her back. Later in the morning she sells her vegetables. Feliza, who has had no formal education, believes that with a successful business, she will be able to support her children and provide them with a bright future.\r\n \r\nFeliza has successfully completed her first loan with Friendship Bridge, a loan that helped her to continue running her business, as well as pay for household expenses and her children\u2019s needs. Now Feliza is applying for her second loan, which she plans to use to buy vegetables in bulk, which will allow her to expand her business further. Feliza\u2019s short-term dream is to devote herself to her vegetable business and provide a stable home for her children, allowing them to go to school.\r\n\r\nFeliza\u2019s Trust Bank, Las Margaritas Patzicia, is composed of eight women, most of whom are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Together, they participate in monthly educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons, combined with their loans, help them to provide a better life for themselves and their families. The women of Las Margaritas Patzicia are grateful for the people who trust in them, enabling them to obtain loans for their businesses and overcome the poverty that surrounds them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1121319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She lives in Northern Peru in a rural area near Tambogrande. She has developed a strong reputation as a reliable supplier of quality food that locals enjoy. She has been involved in this activity for the last six years.\r\n\r\nIndeed, she has worked very hard to consolidate her small business and has previously taken out a loan with Edpyme Alternativa supported by Kiva, having used it to buy supplies for her shop. \r\n\r\nAs the number of clients have increased and the range of food offered becomes wider, she now looks to make a second loan of 2000 PEN to buy a fridge. \r\n\r\nRural areas are often harder to reach and as a result the incentive to provide them with access to credit is smaller for bigger capital providers. Hence, the role of Kiva and Edpyme for this type of client is particularly important.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":714938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a fridge to store some of her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T14:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T14:00:12Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":135.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":138.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":151.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":163.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":169.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":174.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":180.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":188.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":192.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.66,"local_amount":135.9,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":139.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317341},{"amount":111.74,"local_amount":288.35,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":295.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374158},{"amount":58.55,"local_amount":151.1,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":154.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385393},{"amount":60.64,"local_amount":156.5,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":160.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322978024},{"amount":63.39,"local_amount":163.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115195},{"amount":133.04,"local_amount":343.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":351.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506871},{"amount":69.83,"local_amount":180.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":184.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804353},{"amount":73.12,"local_amount":188.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T08:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":193.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364512511},{"amount":152.03,"local_amount":392.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":402.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381695936}],"funded_date":"2012-07-21T07:01:49Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T08:48:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":440869,"name":"Jaznalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Jaznalyn, 31, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, where groceries, toiletries, and beverages are sold piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5-PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jaznalyn earns money by getting her supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Jaznalyn's store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Jaznalyn earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nJaznalyn is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Jaznalyn hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

After returning back to Tajikistan he has started his own farm, where he primarily grows wheat, potatoes and other staple crops as well as raises farm animals. Saidaskar has more then ten years of farming experience and his wife and older children help with the work load. The harvest is usually sold whole sale from home to resellers. Saidaskar wants to take out this loan to purchase fertilizer and some more cattle for his

She started her business in the hopes of making a profit to support her family, for home improvement, and the education of their children in order to raise them as educated people. Kumush and her husband have lived in Husan over 20 years.

He is married and has adult children. Mavliddin always had a hard life. As a child he raised sheep and goats. Every day after school he would also work in the fields to help his parents support their family. After Mavliddin grew up and married he continued to farm and raise animals for a living. For the last 20 years he has primarily grown wheat, corn, peas and other staple crops. His wife and sons help with the work load and the family sells their harvest to the local residents below market price. Most people in the region purchase their own wheat and then have it ground at the mills and bake their own bread. This year Mavliddin wants to get higher profits so that he can pay for the wedding of his youngest son. Mavliddin want to take out a loan to purchase cattle which he will fatten and sell for meat at the market. He will use leftover profits to expand his business and improve the farm.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1117511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T17:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T17:00:20Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavliddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308190213},{"amount":262.67,"local_amount":1250.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162340},{"amount":262.52,"local_amount":1250.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801297},{"amount":262.31,"local_amount":1249.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381692685}],"funded_date":"2012-07-22T13:31:42Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:59:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":440086,"name":"Nelva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelva es socia del Bancomunal Milenio y tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y madre de dos hijas.

His wife is a home maker and takes care of their cows while Bahtiyor is at work. In the past cattle raising was their primary source of income but now the children grew up and much more money is required for their education.

He hopes that with Kiva\u2019s help he will be able to continue in business, to earn more income and be able to offer his family a better economic standard.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1121254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T17:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T17:50:31Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anibal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":440128,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de cabiba de internet y tambien juegos de play station,la socia tiene un local donde trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 6:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de cabina de internet y juegos de play station.La socia solicita el credito para comprar accesorios para la computadora y tambien para comprar juegos de play station.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"This member still works in her Internet booth business, and also with PlayStation games.

She raised and sold animals before but her earnings were too meager to continue and she switched to rice farming when she saw that it was more profitable.

For the future, she wants to buy cattle that she raise and sell for extra income.  Her immediate plan is to plant 2 tracts of rice and use the income to pay off this loan.

Andres started out helping his dad with raising his livestock while his mom lived off the income she made renting out their land.  His parents gave Andres some of their land as an inheritance.  Having gained experience and skill in the business, he decided to start working for himself.  He started sowing crops on his own.  He has two 'manzanas' (one manzana = 1.68 acres) of land sown with rice.  He has the support of his cousins, children and wife in his business.  They help him to prepare his land.  He has been in this business for three years now.  He sells his crops in the local area to avoid having to pay for transportation and because it is safer to sell the produce in his own community.  He also receives additional income from selling milk from his cows.  This enables him to help with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAndres is taking out this loan to prepare his land and to buy fertilizers, supplies and pesticides.  He believes that this will be helpful because he will be able to enjoy a better production which will allow him to increase his income.  His future plan is to buy more cattle to breed so that he can sell thoroughbred cattle and maintain his milk production.  His most immediate aim is to sow 2 'manzanas' with rice and use the profits to repay his loan.  His goal is to get ahead in life together with his family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1121547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to prepare his land and to buy fertilizers, supplies and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres Abelino \t\t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":639.23,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":319.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":319.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325.01},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":440942,"name":"Rin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rin is 30 years old and a resident from the Prey Chor district of Kompong Cham province.

Por otro lado, lo que representa mayor reto para Paty es el momento en que tiene que matar el pollo para elaborar la tinga para sus tostadas, ya que no le gusta hacerles da\u00f1o a los animales. Do\u00f1a Paty dice que una de las experiencias m\u00e1s lindas que ha tenido respecto a su negocio es que a prendido a ser una mujer independiente ya que le gusta trabajar su dinero y sus  ganancias. Dice tambi\u00e9n, que se considera una mujer especial porque aunque ha tenido  necesidades como madre soltera, nunca le faltan fuerzas para lograr lo que se propone.

One of the members of this group is Lorenza Patricia, 48, better known as Do\u00f1a Paty.  Paty makes and sells bread and other Mexican dishes.  Normally she sells her food in a kindergarten located in her community, where she has been selling for 30 years.\r\n\r\nPaty is a single mother.  She comments that, thanks to the good profits she gets from her business, she managed to give her five children a good education.  All of them are already married.  She mentions that one of the characteristics for doing the work she does is to be very hygienic, to have  good seasoning, and above all to be an active person.\r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her business making and selling bread is the aroma of the bread when it comes out of the oven.  Besides, it is her biggest seller.  On the other hand, Paty's biggest challenge is when she has to kill the chicken to make the shredded chicken for her tostadas, because she doesn't like to hurt animals.\r\n\r\nPaty says that one of her most beautiful experiences in her business is that she has learned to be an independent woman, because she likes to work with her money and her profits.  She also says that she believes she is special because, although she has had needs as a single mother, she always has the strength to achieve what she sets out to do.\r\n\r\nPaty requested her loan to buy flour, eggs, lard, yeast, Royal brand baking powder, butter, and milk to make bread.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Elva, Cecilia, Martina, and Susana, who all sell Mexican snacks; Elsa, who sells food; Rosalina Alberta, who sells beverages; and Silvia, who sells bread.  They thank Vision Fund for helping all the mothers who never give up and who want to have the income to be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1116832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making bread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Sebastian Ixacapa,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T22:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T22:10:12Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6034.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6271.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6571.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6907.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7215.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":502.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":524.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":438.86,"local_amount":6034.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6068.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568738},{"amount":456.13,"local_amount":6271.78,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6307.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301400027},{"amount":477.92,"local_amount":6571.41,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6608.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407682},{"amount":502.34,"local_amount":6907.12,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6945.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392119},{"amount":490.49,"local_amount":6744.17,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6782.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119982},{"amount":34.26,"local_amount":471.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":473.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068206}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T15:11:41Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:08:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":440213,"name":"Alejo Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Alejo Armando, tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, tiene una hija y vive en Puerto Cortes.\nHace 8 a\u00f1os que Alejo Armando, se dedica a elaborar y vender HOT DOG (pan relleno con un hot dog , repollo y salsa caliente), de esta forma se gana la vida y ayuda a su familia.

Her husband now uses the car as a taxi cab which brings additional profits to the family. In order to further expand their business Shirinkan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 115,000 som (KGS) which she will use to purchase groceries for resale at her store.

Zaporozhskaya region of south-eastern Ukraine. Elena rents a store space where she sells groceries: fish, sausages, pasta, pastries, drinks, ice cream etc. She really likes her job. In her store all the groceries are carefully arranged and it is always clean and cozy. Other grocery stores in the city are located far away from Elena's store so there is not shortage of customers. Her groceries are in demand and there are many regular clients. Elena has had her grocery store for 3 years already.\r\n\r\nElena is planning to invest 10000 griven from the Kiva loan to replenish her inventory and purchase more sausage varieties, more kinds of pastries etc. She is a very goal oriented person and her business has been profitable but this spring the store suffered two robberies and Elena lost a lot of money. The criminals have been caught and will be persecuted soon. Elena has bravely survived these disasters and is now working extra hard to repair the damages, as the grocery store is the main source of income for the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1120300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Bayaraa, 35, is an electrician in the power plant in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. His salary is not so high and it does not usually meet his family's needs. He lives with his wife and his two children in their old house. His wife is a pharmacist, but she still has not been employed and she runs a taxi business to increase the family's income. \r\n\r\nHis house was built in the early 1990s and since then it has never been renovated or had any repairs. Due to this, it is becoming difficult and uncomfortable to live in their old, bad house. Especially in winter, his house becomes very cold due to the heat loss through the windows and walls. So he decided to make necessary repairs to his house. To start with, he is planning to put in wall and window insulation. He hopes it will be very helpful to reduce the smoky coal usage and the related excessive fuel cost. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 \u00baC (-40 \u00baF), even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. Credit Mongol believes that together, we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

","en":"Bisalomat is a 57 year old woman and has three children. Unfortunately her husband passed away several years ado. Bisalamot works as a nurse at the local hospital. Her house is in bad shape and the roof has been leaking all winter. Bisalamot's salary is just enough to support her family and not enough to pay for roof repairs. She is planning to use this loan to repair the roof and refresh the rest of the house. This is her third loan and Bisalamot has never defaulted and always repaid on time.

He knew the business very well since his family had much experience in it.  She suggested they start the business at home.  They did not have any money for the machinery but a neighbor of hers who had owned a bakery and still had the equipment offered to rent it to them with an option to buy.  She accepted and they still use it to date.\r\n\r\nShe buys what she needs for production daily and her portfolio rotates every two days, the time in which she collects payment for what she sells.  She\u2019s asking for her first Kiva loan because she wants to reinvest in supplies and raw materials like flour, margarine, yeast, spices and eggs for production.  With this she will be able to have stock on hand to meet growing demand.  In addition, she wants to buy a display case to sell directly to the public since she currently makes the product and immediately distributes it to neighborhood stores, her main clientele.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is being able to own her own baking equipment and not have to rent it from her neighbor any longer so that her profits will be greater and her profitability will be higher than her current 28%.\r\n\r\nGina lives with her husband and three minor children, the products of her union.  In addition to the bakery, she earns additional monthly income selling merchandise to order for which she gives her customers up to 30-day payment

Actually she is a doctor and pharmacist. She lives with her husband and daughter and her old mother in the common apartment which is in Kherlen, an eastern boundary city in Mongolia.\r\n\r\nShe wants to take a loan to buy building materials for the repairs of her old apartment. She is planning to insulate the walls and windows at first because it becomes very cold inside the rooms without the wall insulation, then it costs too much money for the smoky coal to warm the rooms inside. Also it contributes to the bad air in the city. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters, where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.\r\n\r\nThe loan Tserenkhand is taking will be dedicated to buying the building materials to make repairs and to insulate the walls of her old apartment rooms to reduce heat loss and

Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"Patricia is part of the \u201cSemillitas Del Sur\u201d (Little Seeds from the South) communal bank belonging to the city of Talca.  She\u2019s been a merchant, specifically a grocer, for the last two years.  She comments that she works by herself Monday through Saturday from 9am until 9pm; her store is home-based.  She buys the merchandise and supplies she needs to restock her store in various economically convenient supermarkets and low-price distributorships.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy a freezer and a little more merchandise to stock her store.  One of her goals is to have a larger store with a greater variety of products and ingredients for her clientele to generate higher income and thus be able to opt for a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nPatricia lives with her husband and two daughters who are 19 and 10 years old and who are students.  Her dream is to own her house to provide her family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful and happy for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has given her because it\u2019s allowed her to invest in her business.  In addition, she feels very comfortable in the company of her fellow entrepreneurs in the communal bank because they share different activities and interests which have been moments of enjoyment for her.  With respect to the training provided at meetings, she\u2019s learned how to better run her business.\r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule Region located in the center of the country.  It\u2019s the administrative, cultural and economic center of the region being the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious reference to Talca in Chile, the phrase \u201cTalca, Par\u00eds y Londres\u201d (Talca, Paris and London).  Among the myths referring to it, some say it comes originally from something an Englishman said:  \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d (Talca seems like London) because of the thick fog that frequently blankets the city in winter similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1121612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and more stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":620551,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29394},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":31406},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33275},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32112},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33810},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33459},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33778},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34100},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34426},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":34754},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35086},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35421},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34861},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":36847},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36443},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":36791},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37040},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37548}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.21,"local_amount":29394,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":29746.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430218},{"amount":330.48,"local_amount":164062,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":166031.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332992},{"amount":276.08,"local_amount":137058,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":138703.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879013},{"amount":286.47,"local_amount":142215,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":143922.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147767},{"amount":297.76,"local_amount":147822,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":149596.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380927}],"funded_date":"2012-06-24T05:52:16Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":440950,"name":"Peang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peang is a local farmer who works hard at a rice field in order to support her family's living.

Since she was very young, she had to help in her home because what her mother earned from her work as a maid, wasn\u2019t enough to cover the household expenses.  Through a friend she began to sell products by order that were bought through specialized catalogs.  Nowadays Sandra buys the products directly and sells them to customers in the La Sierrita neighborhood where she lives-to friends and referred customers.  With her first Kiva loan she bought a large quantity of products to fill the existing orders.  These products are items such as perfumes, lingerie, clothing, and small electrical appliances.  With it she hopes that her sales will increase for a profit of more than 40%, the level that she currently manages.  Her customers buy mostly on credit and pay her under 30 days.  Her main problem is  keeping her business in the area where she lives because there are security issues that force her to be very careful and strict with her customers.

She is requesting a loan again so that she can continue to buy more handcrafted items made from wood such as vases, tables, lamps, rocking chairs, sectional benches, and a variety of other items.  Gloria is a restless youth with a strong desire to excel and build her business into a large company.  Ever since she was granted her first loan, Gloria has been enrolled in accounting and finance classes in a public institution that offers professional programs; she has completed 5 modules there.  This makes her very happy, and she works every day to make her dream a reality.  She wants to organize her business inside her house, giving it more space so that it can be seen by passers-by.  Her message for all the Kiva lenders is the following: \"Thanks to all of you, I am striving toward my goals, and maintaining a firm intention to continue ahead so that I can achieve each and every one of my goals.  Thank you so much for your support.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1120510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Mongolia. He is an electrician in a private company, where he has been working since 2007.  Before that Mr. Ochirkhuu used to run a taxi business. \r\n\r\nMr. Ochirkhuu's monthly salary does not usually cover his family's necessities. So he wants to restart his old business - the taxi business - again. He will run it beyond his work in the nighttime. So, he now needs money to cover the cost of purchasing a car. It will be a car with a natural gas engine which is natural-oriented and less harmful to the environment. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the smoky and extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolia's hard air pollution.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to cover the cost of buying a car which uses natural gas.

Enkhtaivan, 55, is a pensioner who lives with her husband and her son in a ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a watchman in a company, and he doesn't earn that much. Enkhtaivan\u2019s retirement benefit is about $125 per month, and both of their incomes do not cover their family\u2019s expenses. Her son works in a supermarket. \r\n\r\nRecently, her husband decided to start a taxi business to increase their family's income. So, Enkhtaivan is taking out a loan to support her husband and the start-up of his new business. As he said, he will run a taxi after his day job (during the night), and that will be very helpful in solving his family's financial issues. \r\n\r\nThe main thing is that he is choosing a car that runs on natural gas. He and Enkhtaivan totally believe it will help to reduce the air pollution from cars. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is another reason for Mongolia's air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and also to buy cars that use natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease the pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n\r\nThe loan Mrs. Enkhtaivan is taking out will be used to cover the cost of buying a car that uses natural gas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1123306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Green"],"use":"To

His salary is not so high; usually it does not cover his family's necessities. He lives with his wife and his 2 children in their old house. His wife used to work as a herder; now she is employed as a janitress.  \r\n\r\nThe house was built 23 years ago, and it has never been renovated or repaired.   It is more and more difficult and uncomfortable for Sukhtulga and his family to live in their old, rundown house. Especially in winter, the house becomes very cold because of heat loss through windows and walls. So Sukhtulga decided to make necessary repairs. First he plans to fix the walls and repair the roof.   He hopes those repairs will be very helpful in reducing his use of coal, which is very smoky to burn and also costs too much. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density of any country in the world, it is one of the most polluted. This is due to the long and cold winters, when temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities.  Even in summer, many parts of the country are very cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both houses and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night as families just try to stay warm.  \r\n\r\nIn response, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans for home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.  Credit Mongol believes that together we can decrease pollution and the harm it does the environment and Mongolians' health. Sukhtulga's loan will be dedicated to buying building materials to repair his home and insulate its walls and thus reduce heat loss and harmful emissions.

Sin embargo, su sue\u00f1o es tener m\u00e1s vendedores para abarcar nuevas zonas donde pueda vender m\u00e1s productos.  Este es su primer credikiva con el que desea comprar escobas, traperos y medicamentos por volumen para as\u00ed obtener costos m\u00e1s bajos y al venderlos lograr aumentar sus ganancias.  Uno de sus mayores desaf\u00edos ha sido la recuperaci\u00f3n de la cartera, esta rota cada 8 d\u00edas pero algunas veces lo que recupera no es suficiente para realizar las compras y responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.  Wilson se considera un hombre trabajador, con muchas ganas de salir adelante y de brindarles un futuro mejor a sus hijos, d\u00e1ndoles estudio y haciendo de ellos unas personas de bien.","en":"Wilson, a parent, is 38 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Los Cedros de Soledad. \r\n\r\nHe works marketing cleaning products and hardware, and distributes generic medications from store to store in different neighborhoods of the city. He works with 3 employees who are responsible for delivering the product to the customers since the market is large. However, his dream is to have more sellers in order to extend over new areas where he can sell more products. \r\n\r\nThis is his first Kiva loan with which he wants to buy brooms, mops and medications in volume in order to obtain lower prices and to sell them successfully increasing his earnings. One of his biggest challenges has been the recovery of his capital, this turns over every 8 days but sometimes what he gets it back is not sufficient to make the purchases and respond to the orders from his customers. Wilson is considered a hard worker, eager to get ahead and provide a better future for his children, giving them an education and bringing them up to be good people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1120551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products
