The building is in the middle stage and the basement, walls and roof are built completely. Now he needs some money to buy the building materials to fix the inside and add wall insulation materials. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

Abdurasul's daughter helps her father to grow and process produce. \r\n\r\nAbdurasul has been receiving loans from \"Imon International\" for a few years and has an excellent credit history. Using the profits from his business he has been able to make repairs to his house and built another house for his family. There is a steady improvement in the family's living conditions.

cradles.  Despite the fact that the job is tiring and requires a lot of patience, Khudoikul has a lot of optimism.  His trade provides him with moral satisfaction.  Every time he builds a new cradle he takes into account the quality, longevity, and beauty of the design and of course its ease of use.  Since his fantasy knows no bounds he would like to take out a loan in order to translate his ideas into reality.  These resources will go toward creating new wood masterpieces that are so necessary for the home and for childcare.

Despite the difficult life of farmers in the current economy Madina still grows crops for sale. She has a lot of experience in both farming and animal husbandry. Madina mainly grows wheat, potatoes and other staple crops. She uses a portion of her harvest for the needs of her own family and also prepares fodder for the livestock from crop leftovers. The rest of her harvest Madina sells to the local people at below market prices.

She has been running her business since last year and earns only a modest income. \r\n\r\nErdenechimeg lives with her husband and her two children in their recently-built house on a small plot of land. Her new house is built of cement bricks and loses a lot of heat, so she has decided to insulate the walls with red bricks, which are a very good insulation material. She hopes that her house will be warm after the repairs. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 C (-40 F), even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are still extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Erdenechimeg is taking will be dedicated to buying building materials to insulate her house.

Yesenia has a store where she sells a variety of merchandise, women's products, housewares and school supplies.  She also makes the most of her premises to offer a telephone service which she previously ran from her parents' home.  Yesenia has gradually gained a very good customer base.  She manages to sell not only retail, among her neighbors, but also stocks the stores around her.  Her sales have gradually increased and, as a result, her purchasing needs, in bulk and for cash, have also increased.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the loan to buy men's and women's shoes and men's, women's and children's sweaters, as these are the goods which have the best turnover and she is preparing for the holiday season when her volume of sales will increase.  Yesenia's aims for growth and prosperity are never-ending because she would like to give the best of herself for the sake of her two children so that they can enjoy a promising future.

started working as a merchant. He started his business with the hope of earning income to take care of his family. He sells dried apricots and processes apricots from an orchard for later sale. He runs the business by himself, although his wife helps him process the apricots. Each year he buys apricot trees and rents  1.5\u20131.8 hectares of orchard space from the cities of Kairakkum and Kandbadam. Shukhrat also sells dried apricots; he buys them at the market in Kanibadam and sells them in Isfar. Shukhrat is married and has one son. He has received loans through IMON International for several years, and has a good reputation and an excellent credit history. This provides him with some additional income. Shukhrat would like to obtain a loan in the amount of 3000 dollars to acquire an orchard's worth of apricot trees to grow and process apricots."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1122053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He has 2 children with ages ranging from 1 year to 10 years. He describes himself as a customer-friendly and business-minded man. He operates a retail store where he sells home products such as Blue Band (a brand of margarine), bread, salt, sugar and cooking fat.\r\n\r\nHe has been involved in this business for 8 years and employs 1 staff member. His business is located in an area that is conducive to business and his primary customers are hotels and local residents. He describes his biggest business challenge as inadequate funds for improving the business.

He always has been a very hardworking, persistant person; in his free moments, he likes to spend a little time reading, and on occasion he cooks a delicious Arroz Chaufa [fried rice with vegetables, eggs, and meat] to share with his family. Unfortunately, he was not able to pursue a degree due to lack of resources, but he would have liked to have been able to study agriculture.\r\n\r\nThanks to his enterprising spirit and the support of his family, Antonio works in agriculture on a leased plot of land where he grows potatoes; he works about ten hours a day. Antonio is very happy with his business, since he has always really enjoyed farm work.\r\n\r\nAntonio is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help being offered, he will be able to purchase a motor for irrigating his crops. That way, he will be able to maintain the yield of his potato crop and his alternate lemon crop, thereby increasing his sales and economic income so that he can continue to expand his business and acquire his own land; with his own land, he hopes to fulfill his greatest dream of seeing his children all grown up.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1122760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase an irrigation motor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-23T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-23T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1058,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345225}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T11:16:16Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":441101,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 52 years old and married with 7 children.\r\n\r\nErlinda works hard to provide for her family.

They live in their own house, which they both built in the native community Alto Incariado. She has farmed for 22 years and declared her business when she started her family. She plants coffee, bananas, corn, and cassava in the five plots of land granted to her by her community. The work is tiring, so staff is needed to successfully complete the field work. When this happens she must prepare meals for everyone. Odilia is happy with the results that her land gives her, so she is thinking about planting in greater numbers. To do this, she must invest in the purchase of small coffee plants and sacks of fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that she receives from MFP and she holds herself responsible to make her payments on time. She belongs to the community bank \"Shantzoshis\", a solid and cooperative group. \r\n\r\nWith the money from this loan, she will be able to buy 20 sacks of organic fertilizer for her coffee crops.

She is married and has four children. Her youngest son is four years old. Zhanyl works in the local registration office. To supplement her income, she has a livestock and small farming business started with 10,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS) or approximately $212 USD. Thanks to her persistent efforts, Zhanyl now has a cow, calf, and heifer and one hectare of land growing beans and peppers.

En su hogar su esposo trabaja, con una prestigiosa universidad en su sede campestre; adem\u00e1s del negocio de tienda Berenice, tambi\u00e9n vende fritos todas las tardes, en un sector muy concurrido del municipio, donde ofrece empanadas, carima\u00f1olas (un amasijo de yuca relleno de carne, queso o pollo que se consume frito.) arepas con huevo, papas rellenas y la especialidad de la casa que es \u201cla arepa rellena de carne con huevo\u201d; para el desarrollo de este \u00faltimo negocio, es apoyada por su cu\u00f1ada en la tienda,  mientras Berenice est\u00e1 en la fritanguer\u00eda.

She has a store that she opened 5 years ago in the town of Puerto Colombia, on the seashore.  She found an unoccupied space with no competition nearby.  There is an important sales potential that Berenice hasn\u2019t been able to capture since she doesn\u2019t have enough working capital. When she needs to restock, since there are products that turn over quickly, she must again go to buy, raising the transport costs and often leaving her customers unsatisfied.  Her husband works in the home town at a prestigious university at the country campus.  Besides the store Berenice also sells fried food every afternoon in a busy area of the town where she offers empanadas (stuffed pies) carima\u00f1olas (yucca meal stuffed with meat, cheese or chicken that are eaten fried), arepas with eggs (typical Colombian pancake-like item), stuffed potatoes, and the specialty of the house \u201cmeat stuffed arepas with eggs\u201d.  Her sister-in-law helps her with this part of the business by being in the store while Berenice is doing the frying.  Her future goal is to enlarge her store, have diversified products and convert it into a well-organized self-service establishment.  Until this happens Berenice works with a lot of effort to obtain a margin of no less than 20% and a turnover of inventory of 18 days, financial indicators that will project her growth.  Now she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first that she will have with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she will use it to buy food, provisions, meat, and groceries in large quantities with which she will increase her stock.

Thanks to her persistent efforts, Nurkyz now has two cows, 50 sheep and four hectares of land where she grows beans, potatoes and the perennial grasses that feed her herd. To further develop her business, Nurkyz applied to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS ($1075) to buy bean seeds, fuel and fertilizer.

Como cada vez mas crece su clientela y aumentan las exigencias de calidad, Diana est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 una fileteadora industrial de segunda y materiales como telas, hilos, aplicaciones y accesorios, para desarrollar nuevos dise\u00f1os ajustados a la moda y a los pedidos de su exquisita clientela. ","en":"Diana is 24 and owns a sewing workshop located in the Puerto Colombia municipality, where she lives with her husband and 8-month-old baby. She taught herself to sew using an old family sewing machine given to her by a relative. Later, she took a course from SENA, the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (National Apprenticeship Service) and perfected her technique. She now takes courses on the internet. Diana's customers live in Puerto Colombia, where she lives and has her workshop. Puerto Colombia is a municipality on the seashore very close to the city of Barranquilla. She says that the busy season for her is in December, at which time she hires workers for processing in order to serve her clients effectively. As her customer base keeps growing and demanding quality, Diana is requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a second-hand industrial sewing machine as well as items such as thread, fabric, applications and accessories in order to make more designs in keeping with current fashions and her customers' orders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1123880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Jaime, age 27, owns a store located in the municipality of Puerto Colombia, on the shores of the sea. He lives with his wife and two children ages 2 and 4. At a very young age, Jaime started working as an assistant in a store owned by a merchant from the interior of the country. He gathered experience from his boss and his day-to-day work over four years. He then poured this experience into his own enterprise in a highly-populated sector with unpaved roads. Jaime says that he has enough experience and social understanding to offer a good service and accommodate customers who have scarce resources; he will sell just one tomato or a half bar of soap. On top of selling groceries, on the weekends he also sells beer, taking advantage of his municipality's tourist appeal. For this, he gives free rein for sharing music and turns on a powerful sound system, setting out plastic chairs and tables on his terrace. He says that \"strangely, it is the poorest men who most consume liquor on the weekends; in keeping with the phrase, \"No hay borracho pobre ni cobarde\" [\"There are no poor nor cowardly drunks\"].\r\nJaime hopes to expand both his businesses. For this reason he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will purchase groceries, meat, and supplies, which will allow him to have an additional working capital with which to buy stock, improve his stock, and rotate his merchandise more rapidly. This will generate him a slightly higher income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1123863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is married and has two daughters.  He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.  He breeds cattle and has 10 years of experience in this field.  Sadiq gets financial support from the government, but 100 AZN is too small an amount to cover his family's needs.\r\n \r\nCattle breeding requires a lot of physical activity and spending most of the time in the open air.  Pasturing takes 80% of Sadiq's time. He usually buys small calves and then raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and resells them for a profit in the livestock bazaar.

Yusif has 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who taught him how to best look after cattle. He receives 120 AZN of financial support from the government monthly, but this is too low to cover family needs.\r\n\r\nYusif usually buys small cattle and then raises and fattens them in 5-6 months and resells them at profit in the local livestock bazaar. He sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring 250 AZN of income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma and they always use yoghurt sauce.  Milk products are considered very healthy and are present in everyday life. \r\n  \r\nThis is the only financial income in his family and not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. Yusif has applied for a loan of 1800 AZN to purchase three head of cattle, one milk cow, and fodder.

Diana has always enjoyed the retail trade and previously sold clothes for a living, but she saw that the food business was more profitable.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 21,000 HNL so that she can invest in the purchase of supplies for preparing food and other products.  This will help maintain the inventory of her business and result in more earnings.  Her goal is to continue working so that her business can grow.  On a personal level, she hopes to develop as a businesswoman and have a better standard of living.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1121626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making her dishes as well as fried dough, ice cream, and soft drinks to sell.

He is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past five years, Jonathan has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jonathan has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Jonathan to generate greater profits and increase the capital in the business. Jonathan hopes that in the future he will be able to expand the business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nJonathan is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

For this reason, the working capital she has with which to buy goods and respond to demand has become insufficient and she must wait to recover the money she is owed for her goods before she buys more.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her fifth loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the money to buy a chiller cabinet so that she can increase her sales of beer and soft drinks which makes her very good profits and is a cash-based business.

for over ten years now. He is truly as master with wood and utilizes his carpentry skills to build doors and floors for his customers. He has a storefront location in Florida with a shop where he produces all his original pieces. \r\n\r\nHis business has expanded since its early days of operation and he now employs two people on a project basis. Enrique, however, has very outdated equipment which has dramatically slowed down his production and limited the types of pieces he can produce. With the purchase of a new table saw, compressor and edge banding machine he will be able to increase his work capacity and expand his repertoire. \r\n\r\nHe originally opened his business because he had a strong desire to be self-employed. His success has allowed him to support his wife and children, and send money home to Nicaragua to support his extended family there. He hopes that in the future these machines will enable him to take on new and exciting projects, and allow him to continue to employ people and contribute to his Florida

For this reason, she is applying for a new Kiva loan which she will mainly use to buy meat products and some other merchandise that her customers have requested such as silver- and gold-plated jewelry.  Her message to Kiva lenders is the following: \"I would like to thank Kiva for the work that they are doing: lending to people with limited financial means so that they can have another income with which to improve their quality of life and continue to thrive in their business\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1124004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
