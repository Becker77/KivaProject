Currently, he is applying for a new Kiva loan, which he will use to purchase implements such as cooking pots, ladles, and grinders. Additionally, he will purchase supplies so he can invest in a greater quantity of raw materials and a larger number of soft drinks. With this investment, he will improve his customer base, as well as his sales. Sofanor will be happy because his earnings will improve. His message to Kiva financiers is: \u201cThank you very much for your support. I had difficulties when my cooler was damaged, but luckily, I managed to overcome that situation and repay my loan. I hope that you will continue to support me so I can continue to strengthen my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1124104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase implements such as cooking pots, ladles, and grinders, as well as supplies.

Ella en su tierra natal, tambi\u00e9n se dedicaba a comercializar ropa por encargo y mediante la modalidad de cr\u00e9dito.  Cuando se instal\u00f3 en esta ciudad, identific\u00f3 la venta de calzado, como una estrategia mas productiva para a Costa, por eso empez\u00f3 con este producto, con el que le ha ido muy bien y desea  hacer crecer su negocio cada vez mas, hasta lograr su estabilidad financiera totalmente. Cuando inici\u00f3 su negocio, Yolanda debi\u00f3 trabajar fuertemente, pero poco a poco fue capitaliz\u00e1ndose y adquiri\u00f3 as\u00ed mismo 2 puestos comerciales en los cuales trabaja, en uno vende chancletas y calzado informal en general y en el otra papeler\u00eda. Con el fruto de su trabajo de un largo periodo, compr\u00f3 su propia vivienda y fue adecu\u00e1ndola hasta lograr habilitarla, con tres dormitorios, para estar m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda con su familia.

En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 calzado, chancletas, porque planea extender su mercado en otros puntos comerciales, con el fin de experimentar la potencialidad comercial existente.  Entre sus metas futuras est\u00e1 la de adecuar un local en su vivienda y tener una  miscel\u00e1nea que abarque el mercado alrededor de su residencia. \n\n","en":"Yolanda is 40 years old. She has had a stall in the city center where she sells casual footwear since she arrived in the city of Barranquilla eighteen years ago. She arrived from the department of Antioquia with the hope of finding new horizons since the market in the municipality where she had lived was very saturated. She also sold made-to-order clothing on credit there. When she arrived in Barranquilla she identified shoe sales as a better business strategy for its cost. That is why she started with this product, which has gone very well for her. She hopes to grow her business at every turn until she can achieve total financial stability. When she started her business, Yolanda needed to work very hard, but little by little she has capitalized on her efforts and acquired  two commercial stalls where she works. In one of them she sells flip-flop sandals and general casual footwear, and in the other one she sells paper products. Using the fruits of her labor over a long period, she purchased her own home, which she has been adapting and making nicer, with three bedrooms, so her family can be comfortable. Yolanda purchases her merchandise with cash in a municipality located on the north coast of Colombia that she travels to twice a week. She later sells her merchandise for cash in her commercial stalls, and on 30-day credit for various customers. Currently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she is receiving from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to purchase footwear, flip-flop sandals, because she plans to extend her market to other commercial spots in an effort to discover the potential customer base that exists. Among her future goals is to adapt a storefront in her home and have a corner store that supplies the market where she lives.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1124109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase casual shoes for women, children, and men.

furniture factory for 7 years. \r\nHowever, later he decided to start his own business. He rented out a small room, re-equipped it into a furniture manufacturing facility, and now manufactures cabinet furniture to order. Kitchen furniture is the most wide-spread order. As of today, Alexander already has 2 high-quality wood-working machines that only experienced furniture-makers can afford. \r\nAlexander invests a lot into his business, sets clear objectives and works hard.  He asks for a loan of 15,000 hryven to purchase an edge-beveling machine. This machine will help Alexander manufacture furniture of better quality as well as allow him to speed up the manufacturing process.\r\nThe additional earnings from the loan will help Alexander buy a new car and, perhaps, build a garage. Alexander intends to develop his business; therefore, he will need the necessary equipment, and he is planning on turning to KIVA for support.\r\nNB: the background information is in Russian

She has been involved in this business for almost 2 years. \r\n\r\nBecause Yin does not have a vehicle for household use, she has to spend more on transportation fees for transporting her vegetables to the marketplaces.

She rents a stall at Tosa fruit and vegetable market and buys her products from wholesalers. Her husband works for Ulaanbaatar city\u2019s public trash collecting company as a controller and earns $210 a month.\r\n\r\nThey own a small plot of land with an old wooden house on it. The house is very old, and it needs renovation, especially insulation and a new roof. It loses heat very quickly during winter, and leaks during summer rains. A well-insulated house uses about two tons of coal for heating during winter, but Algirmaa\u2019s house uses twice as much coal, and thus it makes twice as much heavy smoke polluting the air. Ulaanbaatar has been nominated by UNDP as the worst capital city regarding air pollution during winter. \r\n\r\nAlgirmaa is asking for a loan to buy 250 roof tiles, 50 pieces of rock wool insulation for the wall and roof and other necessary tools. The whole project will cost 2,500,000 MNT, but she will cover some costs from her savings. After the completion of the project, the house should become more energy efficient, warm and water tight.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1124410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy 250 roof tiles, 50 pieces of rock wool insulation for the wall and roof and other necessary tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-06-24T17:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-24T17:30:09Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Algirmaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99300},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":110981.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108954.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":119786.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":118375.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":120218.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":127250.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128204.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134682.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":135266.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139678.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141341.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148052.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150428.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154195.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163282.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":99300,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100018.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294313353},{"amount":84.55,"local_amount":110981.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":111785.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369453},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":108954.06,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":109742.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129221},{"amount":1356.77,"local_amount":1780764.14,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1793653.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315365097}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T15:36:49Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy and Andy Gordon","image":1110260}},{"id":440578,"name":"Gulzhakhon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulzhakhon is a hardworking and honest woman.

This business eventually failed, but Pedro received some money for the time he\u2019d worked. He used this money to buy a business which generated enough income to support his wife and two children, now aged 15 and 27. \r\n\r\nPedro recently started selling small appliances in his store. He bought them at good prices from warehouses, and they bring in additional income. His business has been in operation for 13 years, and the majority of the sales are for cash.

Sales are both in cash and on credit. \r\n\r\nThrough determination and hard work, Pedro has managed to acquire two spots in the public market.

Then he decided to become independent, created his own business, and began selling juice and dairy products on the street.\r\n\r\nLater, with some savings he had, he increased his sales by investing in basic goods for the store. Then, through his own efforts and the help of his father, he set up a business in his home. He bought a freezer to keep his goods fresh, and display cases to exhibit his merchandise. His wife helped him with the administrative details of his business while he went off on motorcycle to sell to some areas near his community. \r\n\r\nHis hope is to increase the amount of merchandise he has for his business, with the objective of increasing his sales. He needs the loan for the purchase of goods like milk, cream, cheese, rice, soap, sugar, etc. He thinks the loan will help him because he can move forward with the business by having what the clients ask for the most. His plan for the future is to increase the size of his business. His next goal is to keep working at his business, to earn more, to repay the loan, and to help his family get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1124172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"for

Es en este sitio donde Carlos, desde hace dos a\u00f1os,  ofrece su arte musical, ya sea a trav\u00e9s de interpretaciones con su guitarra en alguna concurrida esquina de la urbe, o a trav\u00e9s de m\u00e1gicas interpretaciones con su viol\u00edn o piano el\u00e9ctrico en alguna fiesta donde haya sido contratado.\n\nLa parroquia de San Buenavetura y toda la provincia en s\u00ed, tienen mucho apego a las artes musicales, es gracias a esto que Carlos desarroll\u00f3 su gusto hacia la m\u00fasica desde su \u00e9poca en el colegio y decidi\u00f3 deleitar con este arte a las personas.\n\nCarlos solicita por primera vez un cr\u00e9dito a Kiva para adquirir unos parlantes o amplificaci\u00f3n que le permitan mejorar el servicio musical que ofrece en las fiestas y en las casas que lo contratan. El sabe que a pesar de trabajar cerca de 12 horas al d\u00eda, siempre es necesario brindar un mejor servicio y por eso siempre est\u00e1 super\u00e1ndose, esforz\u00e1ndose y distribuyendo el tiempo de trabajo con sus estudios.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un grupo musical muy bien equipado, pero sabe que para lograrlo debe dar un primer paso y esto lo conseguir\u00e1 con el dinero que Kiva le entrega.\n\nEl siguiente paso para Carlos es obtener un mayor ingreso que permita ayudar econ\u00f3micamente a su familia.\n","en":"Carlos has lived for a number of years in San Buenaventura, an urban parish in the city of Latacunga, located in Cotopaxi province, Ecuador.  This parish is named after the patron Saint Dr. San Buenaventura, a person who, according to popular beliefs, accomplished many miracles for the inhabitants of this area.  This is also the place where Carlos, for 2 years, has offered his musical art, whether it is through performances with his guitar in a crowded corner of the city, or through his magical performances on the violin or electric piano at a party where he has been hired to play.\r\n\r\nIn San Buenaventura parish, and in the region as a whole, the people have a strong attachment to the musical arts.  Thanks to this, Carlos developed his love of music ever since he was a schoolboy, and he decided to delight people with this art.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Carlos has requested a loan from Kiva.  He will use the loan to acquire some speakers, or amplification, which will allow him to improve the quality of music that he can offer in the parties and houses where he is hired.  He knows that, in spite of working about 12 hours a day, he always needs to provide better service.  For this reason he is always working hard and exerting himself to excel, and allocating time between his work and his studies. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a well-equipped musical group, but he knows that in order to do this, he must take the first step.  He will do this with the money that Kiva is providing him.\r\n\r\nCarlos' next step will be to obtain a higher income that will allow him to help his family financially.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1124186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

She is a single parent and mother of five children. At this time, she is working hard to sustain their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarciana maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalog, and this is how dealers earn a profit. Marciana also has a dress shop for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Marciana is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMarciana dreams of renovating her house and growing her business in the coming years.

He is married and has 7 children, 5 of whom he is in charge of. Pablo is an agricultural worker and sows beans and corn for a living. He started in this activity by helping his parents working the lands. Then, when he was 18 years old, he decided to become independent, and started sowing on his own, with his own money, since before that he had been working taking care of a farm nearby the community. But that income was not enough to cover the expenses of the sowing, which is why he looked for the support of financial institutions in order to invest more in his business. His eldest sons, who are 25 and 23 years old, help him with the agricultural work, and he also hires a farm laborer. Pablo sells his products in the region where he lives to avoid transportation costs. Besides working in agriculture, Pablo works as a security guard for a private company, in order to earn some extra income for his family. Pablo requests this loan to pay for labor and to buy supplies and fertilizers, which he needs in order to sow beans and corn this year. This loan will be very helpful since it will allow him to better prepare the lands and get a better yield from the harvest. His plans for the future are, to repay the loan with the profits earned from the harvest, and with the money left, make some improvements to his home. His next goals are to keep his business active and generate a better income so that he can pull through together with his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1124212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for labor and to buy supplies and fertilizers \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-24T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-24T19:30:08Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo Antonio \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":183.22,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":91.61,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308448994},{"amount":100,"local_amount":91.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531022}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T03:20:38Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marina Romanisio","image":903469}},{"id":441703,"name":"Jovita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Jovita, 40, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines.

She is married and studied through the sixth grade. She has five children, four of which she is caring for, who are studying in secondary school. She makes a living in sales, selling construction materials, which she has been doing for four years. She started this business with savings that her husband had. They started with a small inventory, and later with the support of financial institutions, they were able to invest more in the business by buying a truck to transport their products to other areas. But that was not good enough. Sonia's dream was to be independent and a great businesswoman, with motivation to open a second business. \r\n\r\nToday, thanks to her efforts and her daily hard work, she has had a grocery store, which has been open for six months, which she runs out of her home. In her business she has the support of two of her children, who help her to sell the construction materials, while her daughter attends to the customers in the grocery store. Her husband works as a driver for a private company, to provide another source of income, and provide for the household expenses. Her goal is to increase business in the grocery store by adding new products.   \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to buy basic grains, rice, beans, oatmeal, sugar, cosmetics and medicines, to be able to offer a variety of products. She believes that the loan will be of help to stock her grocery store, to attract more customers, and at the same time generating more profits. Her plans for the future include paying off her loan with the profits generated from the business, and to open her third business, which will be a small restaurant, because she is a person who is very driven to get ahead. She aspires to be one of the best business owners in the area. Her expectation is to maintain the businesses and to keep moving forward with her family and to have a better future.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1124281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic grains, rice, beans, oatmeal, sugar, bread, cosmetics and medicine.

She earns a minimum of Php2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy higher quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.  \r\n\r\nNida dreams to be able to give all her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He started his job from a very young age by helping his parents but over 13 years ago he decided to work on his own. Besides sowing basic grains, he also sells milk that he gets from his cows, which he has been buying with his crop earnings. He has to pay for labor since he does not have the support of anyone and his products are sold in the area to avoid transportation expenses.

Previously, he raised livestock at home and sold it at the animal market. When Yusufjon's animals were sick, it occurred to him to learn the butcher's trade so as to be able to slaughter the animals faster without having to look for someone else. Now, he has been working as a butcher for over 10 years. With his brother's help, Yusufjon runs his shop at the central market.\r\n\r\nYusufjon has been working with MDO Arvand, LLC for several years and has been an active and honest client. He believes that their loans have helped him to grow his business. He has been making good profits and not long ago bought another apartment.

","en":"Mavchuda is a woman who works for a government agency. She is 50 years old and has 3 children - two sons and a daughter who is a student.  She has been taking out loans for 2 years and each time she uses the loans to pay tuition for her daughter. She is a student and is not yet married.  Currently she only thinks about her education. Mavchuda works at the Economic Court and has a steady income, however her salary is small. Her son and her husband, who are also working, help her as well. Our financial support really helped Mavchuda as every time she receives a round sum of money and is able to pay the annual tuition contract for her daughter right away.  She intends to collaborate with us in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1124762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay tuition fee for her daughter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T04:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T04:30:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavchuda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":142.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":147.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":157.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":162.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":168.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":173.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.61,"local_amount":137.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":145.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397536},{"amount":31.65,"local_amount":142.42,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":150.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452372},{"amount":32.72,"local_amount":147.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":155.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212618},{"amount":33.83,"local_amount":152.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":161.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443347},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":157.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":166.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048306},{"amount":36.17,"local_amount":162.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331184290},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":168.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":178.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568256},{"amount":38.66,"local_amount":173.96,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":184.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347117917},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":179.85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":190.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863531},{"amount":41.32,"local_amount":185.95,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":196.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572478},{"amount":42.71,"local_amount":192.19,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":203.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971246}],"funded_date":"2012-06-25T08:09:21Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Saltz","image":943766}},{"id":441829,"name":"Ankhbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ankhbayar is 30 years old and a military man. He lives with his wife and 2 children in an apartment he recently purchased through a loan from a bank. Last August he bought his apartment and made some repairs to it. But it still has some problems such as heat loss and emissions. He is also planning to repair the windows, floor and walls. Last winter was very cold for him and his family without good insulation.\r\n \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country become extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. \r\n\r\nBoth homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to its clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will be dedicated to buying building materials to install wall insulation in his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1124646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy building materials to install wall insulation in his home.

Even though she is retired, she is still a very hard worker and an aggressive one. Her apartment was built in the communist era and since then it has never been repaired or renovated. Last year, it lost too much heat and emissions through the wall and windows. She uses a furnace that uses smoky and toxic coal to stay warm at home. It costs too much and causes air pollution. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. Credit Mongolia believe that together with the borrower, they can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying the building materials needed to insulate the walls and make other repairs.

Undrakh, 29, is a hairdresser who rents a cellar room for 150,000 MNT a month. She has been running her business for three years nonstop. She lives with her parents in an old common apartment, which is in the boundary district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Last May, her family purchased a small plot of land and a house in the ger district. A ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic tent.  The house still needs some extra repairs, especially to the walls, roof, floor, and windows. She hopes that her house will be comfortable and have less heat loss or emissions after the repairs. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying the building materials needed to insulate the walls and make other repairs to the house that her family bought.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.

She is a salesperson and sells various merchandize like ladies accessories, items for the home, stationary items and refreshments. She began her business in 2006 selling some products and little by little she increased her wares and bought displays that she filled with merchandize that her customers needed most. Flor\u2019s sales are mainly cash down although she also sells on credit to some customers on short terms depending on what they agree. Sometime ago, Flor decided to take advantage of the market and began to sell refreshments and drinks during the weekends. She has done very well and has been able to see her store grow. Flor\u2019s goal is to separate the two businesses, by adapting two areas where she would sell merchandise in one and drinks and refreshments in the other. Her businesses are growing and she has to buy everything that her customers want so it is a great challenge to her. This is why she needs a credikiva, her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she will buy stationary products and refreshments to be able to meet and satisfy the needs of her customers. Flor wants to have sales with special prices, since she will be able to buy in greater quantities and this will guarantee the success her credikiva investment."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1125078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy stationary products and refreshments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T07:10:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159598},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186656},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":191011},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":195468},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200029},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":204696},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":209472},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":214360},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":219362},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":224480},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":229718},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":265150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":442050,"name":"Juan Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Juan tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene tres hijos.

Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

Her husband manages the shop and over many years with this work thay have been able to educate their daughters. Their oldest is finishing college.\r\n\r\nAna and her husband buy their materials in the closest town, which is 6 kilometers from their house. Access to the area is very bad because the buses only go by every two hours and when there is a hard rainy season sometimes they don't go by at all. Then she has to pay for an express delivery service and it is more expensive to transport her merchandise from the town to her house. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy merchandise for her coffee shop and thus meet the demand she has from the students from the education center when they have breaks. She feels that she is unable to stock everything they want.\r\n\r\nThe need that will be satisfied is that she will be able to buy more merchandise and meet the demand that she has in the coffee shop from the students more easily. \r\n\r\nHer life will improve gradually, since if she stocks her business more her sales will increase and thus she will have more income and obtain a wider profit margin with her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to have a better sticked coffeeshop and also be able to open a small store in her house so that the people who don't have access to the educational center can also buy her products without having to go into the school.

En la medida en que sus hijos crecieron ella necesitaba resolver mas necesidades b\u00e1sicas y con esta sola tarea no alcanzaba a lograrlo. Por eso se fue a las colmenas (peque\u00f1os puntos de venta) del centro de la ciudad y empez\u00f3 a trabajar en una de ellas como vendedora. Con esta experiencia en el mercado, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s decidi\u00f3 independizarse con un dinero, una parte ahorrada y la otra producto de un pr\u00e9stamo de alto costo, que invirti\u00f3 en la compra de calzado, d\u00e1ndose a conocer  en su clientela y entre sus proveedores,  que empezaron a facilitarle cr\u00e9dito; cuando se estabiliz\u00f3 un poco, logr\u00f3 reunir dinero y alquil\u00f3 una colmena, donde vendi\u00f3 mucha mercanc\u00eda econ\u00f3mica durante un periodo de tiempo,  hasta que se organiz\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge y este compr\u00f3 vitrinas para que trabajara cerca a sus hijos, que ya eran 3 y necesitaban de su atenci\u00f3n cercana y aunque al principio atend\u00eda los dos negocios, al final se decidi\u00f3 por el que estaba ubicado en su casa.

For this reason, she started selling fried snacks which enabled her to make money with which to support her children.  As her children grew, she needed to cover more basic needs and with this one job she couldn't manage it.  For this reason, she went to 'las colmenas' (small sales locations) in the city center and started to work in one of them as a sales assistant.\r\n\r\nWith this market experience under her belt, two years later she decided to start working for herself with some money she had (some was savings and the rest was from a high-cost loan).  She invested in buying footwear and became known among her customers and suppliers who started to provide her with credit.  When she had stabilized a little, she managed to get some money together and rent a 'colmena' (small sales location) where she sold a lot of merchandise over a period of time until she made an arrangement with her husband who bought display cases so that she could work near her children, who were 3 and needed her close attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first she served in both businesses, in the end she chose to keep the one that was located at home.  This is how the general store she has today was born.  Her store is located in her home and there she sells a little bit of everything.  She has gained a customer base and a position in the market.  Luz Mery's current goal is to expand her business and to have a stock of merchandise that has a high turnover so that, in the future, she can make the most of her infrastructure and start offering printing services.  Luz Mery is gradually taking important steps and this is why she has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to take out her first Kiva loan.  She will use the loan to buy men's pants, jeans and shirts, and women's accessories as the month of July is approaching and this is a time of year when her sales increase.  Luz Mery would like to be ready to make her best sales."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1122790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy men's pants, jeans and shirts, and women's accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T11:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T11:10:05Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Mery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65108},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84205},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86169},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88180},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90237},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92343},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94498},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96703},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98959},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101268},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103631},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128699}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":439029,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 33 years old business lady.

Georgi raises cattle, chickens and bees, and grows fruit and vegetables. He sells his products - milk, cheese, eggs, honey and produce - in the city of Kapan. Georgi's products are always in high demand as he consistently maintains their high quality. His honey, particularly, is very popular, as it is organic and very good for health.\n\nGeorgi needs a loan of 1,000,000 dram to purchase a truck, which he will use to transport his beehives from his farm into the mountains, and also to bring hay from the fields for his cows, bulls and calves.\n\nGeorgi is 31 years old. He graduated from the Yerevan Agricultural University. Georgi is married and has a four-year-old daughter. In addition to being a farmer, he works as a forester, while his wife works in a kindergarten. Georgi's parents live together with their family: his father helps with farming, while his mother works as a

She is married and has 4 children, 1 of them currently in school. For the past 2 years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her stationery shop, which sells books, pens and does printing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 2000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more printing papers and books for resale, and will help Aisha to generate greater profits. Her business has increased from what it was before. Aisha hopes that, in the future, she will be able to get another loan from BRAC so as to expand her business and buy another printing machine. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Aisha, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1124807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has 3 children with ages ranging from 18 years to 25 years. She describes herself to be creative and focused. She operates a dairy farm where she sells milk. She has been involved in this business for 12 years. Her business is located within a productive area and her primary customers are co-operatives. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the  business.

Fred hopes that, in the future, he will be able to expand his business into a whole sale shop. \r\n\r\nFred is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Fred, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1124821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is small scale family farming. They grow greens on a family-owned plot of land. Lia\u2019s parents-in-law sell harvested greens at the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 700 Laris. It is hardly enough to pay for food for a seven member family. According to Credo estimations, Lia\u2019s family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLia has requested a loan from Credo for constructing a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lia will purchase iron materials and glass for the greenhouse. She will grow greens (in winter and spring months) and cucumbers (during summer and fall seasons) in the greenhouse. Lia and Lasha will work hard in the greenhouse during the whole year to get quality harvests. Lia\u2019s parents-in-law will sell the harvested products at the open market in the nearby town. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the average monthly income of the family by 50%.

The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Leila will purchase a milking cow. She will place the cow in the old cattle-shed, located in family yard. Leila will milk the cow twice a day and produce cheese. She will be able to sell, on average, 20 kg of cheese per month on the local open market. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the average monthly income of the family by 40 - 45%. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their living conditions.

She decided, 10 years ago, to ask him to help her set up a small refreshment stand at their house.  She only sold soft drinks at first but she eventually added fritters and other snacks because that's what the children of the neighborhood most wanted.  She says, \"I like my business because I can see my neighbors . . . especially the children who come here to buy their snacks.
