Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, cuando vendiendo unos pocos productos de belleza, organiz\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a clientela, con la  que gradualmente fue creciendo y as\u00ed mismo Dannys fue agregando art\u00edculos variados, hasta llegar a vincularse a una empresa a trav\u00e9s de la cual ofrece productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas o cat\u00e1logos, con la cual le fue muy bien y as\u00ed mismo fue ganando una mayor clientela que ampli\u00f3 su expectativas, porque su especialidad es comprar los productos que llegan con los mejores descuentos, para impactarlos y fidelizarlos. Dannys al mismo tiempo trabajaba como empleada y esto le ayud\u00f3 a construir su propio capital y una clientela con muchos m\u00e9ritos, que la reconoc\u00eda.  Posteriormente como tenia muchos inventarios de mercanc\u00eda guardada en casi todas las habitaciones de su casa, decidi\u00f3 organizar un espacio solo para el negocio y compr\u00f3 vitrinas con las que organiz\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o punto comercial y como hace tres meses dej\u00f3 de trabajar como empleada de una empresa, invirti\u00f3 el dinero producto de su liquidaci\u00f3n, en la compra de  fotocopiadoras, equipos de c\u00f3mputos y estableci\u00f3 su sala internet en su propia vivienda para ofrecer el servicio de telecomunicaciones, pero necesita hacer adecuaciones en el sal\u00f3n para volverlo mas confortable y atractivo y para ganar aun mas clientela. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer finecimiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual adecuar\u00e1 su local, comprara una puerta de vidrio, una puerta met\u00e1lica corrediza tipo estera, para aumentar la seguridad de sus clientes y la suya propia. Dannys todos sus esfuerzos los tiene dirigidos a su negocio, pues con su crecimiento quiere poder brindarle, cada vez mas bienestar a su familia conformada por su esposo quien la apoya en todo y a su hijo de 1 a\u00f1o de edad, con quien en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su c\u00f3nyuge sue\u00f1a verlo convertido en un profesional exitoso. \n\n","en":"Dannys, 32 years old, lives in the city of Cartagena where she has a commercial business, selling  a variety of merchandise, such as perfume, cosmetics, feminine accessories, and also, services for photocopying and communications.  \n\nDannys launched her business some 5 years ago; while selling a few beauty products, she organized a small client\u00e8le, which gradually grew. Danny added various articles, until building an enterprise that offers products through specialized guides and catalogs. It went well, as she earned an ample customer base; since her specialty is to buy products that come with the best discounts, she had an impact and it made her customers loyal.\n\nAt the same time, Dannys worked as an employee and this enabled her to build her own capital and a meretricious client\u00e8le who recognized her. Subsequently, as she came to have a lot of merchandise inventory stored in almost all the rooms of her house, she decided to organize a space strictly for her business and to buy glass showcases in which she could organize a small commercial area. Then 3 months ago, she ceased to work as an employee at an enterprise, investing her separation money in photocopiers, computer equipment, and establishing an internet station and a telecommunications center in her own home. But, for this, she needs to make improvements to the space, making it more comfortable and attractive if she is to gain more customers. \n\nThis is why she sought a Kiva loan, her 1st approach to the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to fix up her shop, buying a glass door, and a metal, matting-style, sliding door, to improve security for her customers and herself.\n\nAll of Dannys' efforts are aimed at her business, since with its growth, she hopes to be able to offer greater wellbeing to her family, composed of her husband, who helps her in everything, and her son who is 1 year old. She and her husband hope to see him develop into a successful professional.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1124188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to make her internet shop adequate, buying a glass door and a sliding matting-style, metal door for security reasons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dannys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124093},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":129555},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132578},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135671},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":138837},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":142076},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145392},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":151798}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":124093,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338926},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":129555,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":130585.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395480},{"amount":75.33,"local_amount":132578,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":133632.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775269},{"amount":77.08,"local_amount":135671,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":136750.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387269},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":138837,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":139941.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994100},{"amount":80.72,"local_amount":142076,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":143206.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130463},{"amount":82.61,"local_amount":145392,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":146548.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519334},{"amount":86.25,"local_amount":151798,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":153005.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071175}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T04:24:31Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":442121,"name":"Paz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paz is 22 years old and lives in Tigdok, Tudela.

She also takes care of two other people. She opened a hair salon in the capital, which she has been running for three years, and due to her competence, she is acquiring a clientele as time goes by. But she needs to go to her capital to get hair extensions and beauty products in perfumeries each time she has a client, because she buys in small quantities and is therefore constantly out of stock, which penalizes her all the time. There are also periods where the clientele don't come often for hairstyling and other services, which makes her need to buy hair extensions and other beauty products by the box to sell. This will help her grow her business: by opening a mini perfumery, she will lose less time and satisfy her clientele.

","en":"Koshbu is the leader of the \"Ilim-2\" group.  She's forty-three, married, and has four children.  In the year 2000 she was in search of income for her family, so she started her agriculture and livestock business with starting capital of 3000KGS.

In the future, Babita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. In the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping their inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. \r\n\r\nWith a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seeds and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1125966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

years old, married, and has 2 adult children. As the main source of income for her family, Sarina raises cattle, having started her business 25 years ago with an investment of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Sarina's herd currently has 2 dairy cows with offspring. Additionally, Sarina sews plastic sugar bags at home and later sells them to the local sugar factory.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her livestock business, Sarina has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and resale. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business and into construction of a new barn for her animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1126532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Belovodskoe village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-06-25T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-25T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30072.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938676},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":30072.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862863},{"amount":1275,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":60145.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776879}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T19:00:41Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":442234,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario is 53 years old and lives in a rural are in North Peru, close to Lambeyeque, with her husband.

","en":"Reyna is 43 years old. She is from the city of Managua. She is married and a merchant by profession. She is one of the few women in our country who dedicates herself to selling insecticide and fumigation services, an activity which she began 10 years ago. She is the mother of 2 children -- her son is currently studying for a university degree, and her daughter is in the fourth year of secondary school. Reyna started her business through her father, who also worked in the same field. She helped him sell his products, and over time she gained experience and thorough knowledge of the business. Later, she decided to become independent, and she set up her sales area for insecticide in the house where she lives. However, Reyna was not satisfied with that, because her desire is to get ahead. Today, Reyna not only sells insecticides, but she also provides fumigation services, which she has done for the past three years. She works within her own community and in the departments of the city of Managua, Her aim is to eliminate the various pests which are known in the city of Managua. In her business she receives support from her husband, who helps her administer the business. Her expectation is to expand her product line and buy more fumigation equipment to satisfy the needs of her customers, and it is for this reason that she currently needs a loan to buy insecticide and more fumigation equipment. \r\n\r\nShe believes that the loan will be helpful to her because she will be able to invest in her inventory, buying the products requested most often by her customers, and this will generate more income for her. Her future plans are to grow with her fumigation business with help from Kiva, so that she can have a more profitable business. Her next goal is to make her business into a pest control company, reach the point where she employs workers to satisfy customer demand, and become a competitor to the companies currently active in this field.

She is a single mother and she wants to improve her and her son's quality of life by increasing her income. For that reason, she is requesting a loan from Kiva so she can invest in more merchandise; with a better selection, she can improve her profits. Her experience has shown her that it is easier to sell products when customers can see them, rather than just showing them a catalog. Plus, if she makes an investment, she will be able to have better prices and promotional items. With this, she can give her son a better life and buy her own house in the future, since that is her greatest dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1124167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Gustavo ha aprendido constantemente a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os las t\u00e9cnicas necesarias para todo lo relacionado a su trabajo y es por eso que le ha ido bien con su negocio y ya tiene varios clientes fieles. El trabaja un promedio de 6 horas al d\u00eda, pero siente que desea crecer para poder abastecerse de m\u00e1s clientes. Por lo tanto, Gustavo est\u00e1 buscando ayuda para recaudar plata y expandir la infraestructura para su trabajo, en este caso busca construir chancheras para poder adquirir m\u00e1s chanchos y conservar ah\u00ed sus animales en \u00f3ptimas condiciones. Para Gustavo ha resultado realmente dif\u00edcil acceder a cr\u00e9ditos que lo ayuden a crecer esto a pesar de que es una persona que no ha incurrido muchas deudas a lo largo de su vida. \nAs\u00ed Gustavo, considera que si se le facilita el acceso a cr\u00e9dito \u00e9l podr\u00e1 seguir trabajando de la misma manera que lo ha venido haciendo por muchos a\u00f1os pero con mayor capacidad y volumen. Con esto Gustavo dice que no solo mejorar\u00eda su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica si no todos los aspectos de la vida de su familia entera. \n","en":"Gustavo is 39 years old, and lives with Ana, his wife, who is 34 years old, and their two children. They live in the Eloy Alfaro Parish, which is in Latacunga. Latacunga belongs to the province of Cotopaxi in Ecuador, and the city is located about 90 kilometers from the capital city, and has a largely indigenous and mixed population. Latacunga is located at an elevation of 2,760 meters above sea level, and is dangerously close to Cotopaxi, the highest active volcano in the world. Throughout the course of history, the city has been affected time and time again by volcanic explosions. The majority of people in the city are economically dependent on the success of their agricultural and floricultural industries, and also make a living in the tourist and culinary industries present in the province. \r\n\r\nGustavo is from this small city, and a little over two years ago, he started a business next to a church raising and selling pigs. Since he has made an effort to learn constantly through experience and through the tasks of his job, Gustavo is doing well in his business, and he has many faithful clients. He works an average of six hours per day, but he wants to grow and expand so that he can serve and accommodate more clients. He is presently looking for support to expand the infrastructure of his business, and he plans to purchase more pigs and build additional pig pens and corrals to accommodate more pigs in his operation and give his animals better living conditions. It has been very difficult for Gustavo to gain access to loans which would help him to grow his business, since he has had to incur debt over the course of his life. \r\n\r\nIf he does gain access to credit and a loan, he plans to continue working as hard as he always has. Gustavo hopes that the support from this loan will help him improve his financial condition and provide a better quality of life for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1122774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He has been working in that company for two years. He lives with his wife, a librarian, and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His son is a student and always wants to help his parents to increase their family earnings. Also he intends to cover his school tuition fees himself. Recently he decided to buy a car that uses natural gas for running a taxi. According to his plan, he will run his business on weekends and some nights when he has less homework. He believes that using a car which uses natural gas is a big contribution to decrease environmental and natural pollutions. His father, Bold, wants to help his son to start his business. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution.

One such attraction is the Nazca Lines, which are hieroglyphs that have been drawn across large tracts of arid land.  There are also the pyramids of Cahuachi, the aqueducts of Changuillo, and other archaeological sites that lure hundreds of tourists throughout the year.  This area has developed its agricultural sector, especially the production of corn, prickly pears, carmine dye, cotton, butter beans, fruits, and other commodities.  Whenever Gabriel has a little bit of free time, he enjoys listening to music since it provides a distraction and allows him to relax.  Being a good Peruvian, he enjoys traditional national dishes.  One of his favorite foods is chicken with rice.  With the help of his parents, Gabriel was able to earn a technical degree in Computer Science and Information Systems.  For this reason, his parents are very proud of him.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith great enthusiasm, Gabriel works every day in his film and photography business.  He works approximately five hours each day, but whenever there are school parades or anniversaries taking place in the city, he can work up to 12 hours in a day.  Gabriel can serve up to 15 customers in a day and is always attentive to their wishes.  The reason why he is doing well in his business is because he is likeable, provides good service, and above all, is a responsible individual.  \r\n<p>\r\nGabriel is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders.

She is married to Domingo, a driver, and is the mother of their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarisol operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. Aside from the store, she also sells fish for additional income. Marisol earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, Marisol is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarisol hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to support her children's schooling. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1126225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, due to the high unemployment in the country, she has been unable to get a job where she could fully use the education she received. This does not discourage Sandy, who believes that every effort is rewarded and the hardest challenges bring the best rewards. \r\n\r\nAs a child, Sandy learned to weave and embroider. With these skills and her drive to succeed, Sandy and her family decided to start a business selling handicrafts five years ago. Over time, they expanded their business to include the sale of different types of vegetables, and they also raise ducks. \r\n\r\nSandy currently travels to the market three times a week to sell her product. She usually leaves home at 6:30 a.m. and returns at 2 p.m. As her business grew, Sandy saw how she could benefit from a loan and eventually decided to join the Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nSandy explains that as she has diversified the types of products she sells, her customer base has increased. Sandy is about to begin her second loan cycle, and she is planning to use the loan to purchase thread in order to make more embroidered fabrics. In addition, she hopes to buy more food for her ducks. \r\n\r\nSandy is very excited to receive this loan because it gets her one step closer to achieving her dream of running a stable business with consistent revenues, thus giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream of going to college. \r\n\r\nSandy is part of the Mujeres la Bendici\u00f3n de Patzun Trust Bank, with 11 other women who are also working to improve their lives and the lives of their families (among all of them, they have 31 children). During their monthly loan repayment meetings, Sandy and her fellow Trust Bank members participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their family\u2019s health, but also foster a community of support among the women. Sandy smiles as she says: \"We are thankful for the opportunity of microloans as it helps us to promote our small businesses and improve our quality of life.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1124971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Patzun, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Saturnina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandy Jackeline Aracely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2361}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294333446},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301389440},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308148393},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381474},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988606},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331125054},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515645},{"amount":301.34,"local_amount":2361,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2366.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067529}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T18:41:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:50:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":441751,"name":"Nonvignon 8 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement NONVIGNON 8 est compos\u00e9 de trente deux personnes qui vivent dans un m\u00eame quartier.

She is married to Jaime, a driver, and is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJurinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJurinda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to support her children's schooling.

He is a hard worker, despite the fact that he did not complete his education.  He has been planting corn, beans, and wheat for 52 years.  He is the father of eight adult children who live on their own.  Don Alejo began farming at fifteen years old, helping his parents on their lands.  The he decided to become independent.  His father left him part of the land in order to help him.  After he had gained experience and mastered the business, he began working for himself in planting.  Today, with his own effort, he not only plants basic grains but also has his own cows and land that he purchased with the profits from his farm work.  In his business, he pays laborers because the workload is too much for him to handle by himself.  He markets his products in his community and in the surrounding area. His wife contributes additional income to the household selling curdled milk (used to make cheese and yogurt) produced by the cows.  Don Alejo expects to do all the planting tasks, such as cleaning the bean grains, so that production will be better than in years past.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to pay labor costs and purchase inputs, refreshers and compost, which will help him harvest his crops in a timely manner so that he does not have to sell his animals to cover productions costs.  He plans to pay off the loan with the profits from the harvest and invest in the purchase of animals (cows).  He expects to keep his business going on order to get ahead and have a better standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1125503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay labor costs, and purchase inputs, refreshers, and compost.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Alfredo, her business partner. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGirlie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGirlie hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1126385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T18:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T18:00:15Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Girlie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359524},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303359},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2123.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356080},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4247,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114181},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350245}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T18:51:41Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":442680,"name":"Azzam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azzam is 61 years old, married, and lives in Tulkarem.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGina hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is a very hardworking person who very much wants to get ahead and make progress.\r\n\r\nVilma is asking for a loan to buy pots, pans, griddles, glasses, dishes, pans, etc. to have a good stock available to offer her customers.  She thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n and Kiva for the opportunity she\u2019s getting because it will be of great help to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1126567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"

All come from Padre Las Casas, near the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nJulie, president of the communal bank, is sitting in the front row of the photo in third place from left to right, wearing a purple jacket and with her long dark brown hair worn loose. She has her daughter in her arms. Julie dedicates her time to decorating and engraving glass, which she has done for 9 months. She says she works from home Monday to Friday, arranging her work schedule according to her availability. She buys the items for engraving from wholesale distributors, and decorates, polishes and draws figures on them. She buys at low cost so it makes good economic sense. With the loan she intends to buy glasses and wooden boxes for engraving. Her short term goals are to get people aware of her workshop and her glass engraving. In the medium and long term her goals are to expand her workshop, to generate more income, and with this to obtain a better quality of life. Julie lives with her 2 children: her 18 year old son who is studying and her little girl who is 11 months old. Her dream is to increase her skills in her field and get her work known in the local area and beyond, while creating jobs for others in need. Julie is very happy and grateful for the loan and the service provided by Fondo Esperanza. She also says that she feels very comfortable in meetings of the communal bank, as there is an atmosphere of generosity and unity. \r\n\r\nPadre Las Casas is a community in southern Chile, near the city of Temuco, Araucania region.

Among them they have businesses selling clothes, curtains and sheets, underwear, storage, services and more. All are from the municipality of San Bernardo, located in the city of Santiago. \r\n\r\nDaniela, treasurer of the group, is sitting in the second row of the photo, second from the right, wearing a black shirt with a gray stripe, silver rings and her dark brown hair worn loose. She has been selling pillows and cushions for 1 month. She says that, working with her husband, she makes the cushions and pillows and her husband is responsible for selling them in and around the city. She buys the materials she needs for her cushions and pillows from local distributors and in the city of Santiago, where the low cost of materials means the work makes good economic sense. With the loan she intends to buy sponge, foam, thread and fabric to make pillows and cushions. Her goals are to have her own workshop, with her own sewing machine to generate more income, and thus to have a better quality of life. Daniela lives with her husband, who supports her in her business, and their daughter, who is 3 years old. Her dream for her business is to install a workshop at home. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity from Fondo Esperanza, which allows her to invest in her business. She also says she feels very comfortable in the company of other entrepreneurs in the group, because they do different interesting activities, which are fun. From the training given at meetings, Daniela has learned to manage her business better. \r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 18 km south of the main square of Santiago (the capital of Chile). It is known as the capital of folklore, because each year, in January, the \"International Folklore Festival\" is held there, and the roots of the country come together and meet musicians from across South America. It also holds the \"Traditional Crafts Fair,\" attended by both artisans from Chile and other nearby countries. In April the \"April cuecas Mil\" event takes place in the city, with the whole community dancing the cueca (a traditional Chilean dance).\r\n\r\n\r\nEste Banco Comunal se llama \u201cLa Vecindad\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 19 emprendedores que se dedican al rubro del comercio, espec\u00edficamente venta de ropa, venta de cortinas y sabanas, venta de ropa interior, almac\u00e9n, servicios entre otros.
