Her main source of income comes from a cattle raising business she began twenty-seven years ago. She started the business with a capital of 5,000 soms (KGS); today, her business has grown to contain 4 milking cows, 10 sheep, and an 18,000 soms per month income generated from the sale of milk and milk products. \r\n\r\nHoping to expand her business even further, Dinara approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan of 55,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase a milking cow and increase milk production. \r\nShe plans to reinvest the profits from the loan back into her business.

She sells at retail, working seven days a week. She does not have another source of income.\r\nShe has requested for a loan of UGX 400,000 from MCDT to enable her purchase more cosmetics for sale like boxes of cream relaxers, weaves, and braids.

This is something he can do because of the fact that his installed capacity allows it, as the chicken farm can accommodate more chickens. \r\n\r\nBy increasing the earnings from his business, he will improve his income and living conditions. In this way, Cirilo will be able to provide his two children with a better quality of life and give the best to his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1127607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy chicks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T23:00:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":620.16,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":107.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.17,"local_amount":98.4,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":99.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334575},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":101.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":102.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390497},{"amount":103.58,"local_amount":102.78,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":103.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149490},{"amount":105.26,"local_amount":104.44,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":105.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382613},{"amount":106.64,"local_amount":105.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":106.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989702},{"amount":108.26,"local_amount":107.42,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":108.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126111}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T01:48:58Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":442794,"name":"Yaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaa is a petty trader.

","en":"40-year-old Juan comes from Chacaraseca, in Le\u00f3n. He's a Kiva borrower and a farmer. He has been growing vegetables and basic grains for over 10 years. Aside from that, he also raises pigs in order to get another source of income. Juan used the previous loan to buy pigs for raising. It helped him, since he used the profits he got from selling the pigs to cover production costs and to invest in his sesame, yucca and corn crops. Juan currently wants to further diversify his produce with the purpose of satisfying his customers' needs. For that reason he requests a Kiva loan in order to purchase supplies, compost and fertilizer, so that he can invest in growing vegetables and basic grains. He estimates that this new investment will be of help, because he will be able to better maintain his crop, so he can offer quality produce to his customers. His future plans are to keep his business going and to increase his pigs and cattle sales, in order to get higher profits until he can become independent and get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1127646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Among the myths about this saying, some believe that it is a derivation of the original saying by an Englishman, which was, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London) because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the wintertime, similarly to that of the capital on the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1127643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy winter seasonal clothing like sweaters, pants, jackets, sweatshirt, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-27T01:20:45Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-27T01:20:45Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":449123,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":20491},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20686},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20884},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":21083},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":21284},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21487},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":21693},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21488},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22486},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":22319},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":22532},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":22747},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22705},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23409},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":23404},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23628},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23853},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":24081},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":24311},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":24552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":20491,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":20820.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430220},{"amount":168.2,"local_amount":83937,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85286.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332999},{"amount":219.38,"local_amount":109473,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111233.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879020},{"amount":183.14,"local_amount":91393,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92862.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147774},{"amount":239.02,"local_amount":119277,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380931},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":24552,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24946.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988103}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T21:06:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":442962,"name":"Anselma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anselma is 54 years old and lives in Mialen, Clarin.

In her free time, she likes to take a little time to read, and sometimes she makes delicious traditionally cooked beans to share with her brats.\r\n\r\nOn her own iniciative, and with great effort and enthusiasm, Demesia began her small business of fashionable clothing sales.  She does her work walking the streets and through the markets of her city, giving about ten hours a day to her business.  Demesia believes her business is going well because she receives a good reception due to her clothing selection and the good treatment that she offers to her customers.\r\n\r\nDemesia is very thankful to the lenders at Kiva, since thanks to the help she has been given, she will be able to buy merchandise like sweaters, pants, polo shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, etc.  In this way, Demesia will have her business better stocked with clothing items for the current season, and she will be able to increase her sales and her income, with which she wants to begin saving the money necessary to rent a location for a clothing store of her own."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1127636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

From the age of 14, he's been involved in agriculture, which he learned from his father.  He used to work 28,000 square meters of land each year, and the yield was quite good, not like currently; he continues working just as hard, but Mother Nature  doesn't give the same yields, due to all the contamination.\r\n\r\nHe keeps working, sowing his corn crops, on his 28,000 square meters of land, and he gets two crops every winter and two more in the summers.  Additionally, he sows about 3,500 square meters of watermelons.  Candido works the land with his kids, who're between 10 and 15 years old, from about 5AM until 2PM every day.  His family members are all modest, good people, and very responsible.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for from the Fundacion Campo, is to buy himself some agricultural inputs in order to sow corn and grow watermelons.  The investment will help him to make his harvest just like every year, giving him enough to sustain his family and enough money to plant his crops the next year.  He wishes to teach his children to work the land so that they can make their own money through humility and hard work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1127706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

edades de 22 y 26 a\u00f1os. Ella  se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00edas por cat\u00e1logos o gu\u00edas especializadas a trav\u00e9s de las cuales ofrece sus productos como ropa y calzado en las l\u00edneas  femenina, masculina e infantil. Denis inici\u00f3 su negocio con el \u00e1nimo de generar  ingresos, pues no lograba encontrar un empleo y el trabajo independiente le dio esa posibilidad, a partir de su hoy actividad comercial. Su meta es llegar a ser l\u00edder de zona  y aunque ha estado muy cera de hacerlo, la edad de su madre le ha requerido mucha atenci\u00f3n, pero aun sue\u00f1a con lograr este prop\u00f3sito, porque con esta actividad ha logrado apoyar el bienestar de sus hijos. Su credikiva es su primer financiamiento que solicita a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprara calzado femenino y mercanc\u00eda, que sus cat\u00e1logos exhiben con descuentos especiales y ella quiere impactar a sus clientes con cosm\u00e9ticos, perfumer\u00eda al alcance de su bolsillo y esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual su credikiva se muestra como una inversi\u00f3n exitosa. Su principal meta se dirige  a que sus hijos logren finalizar estudios universitarios, para potencializar su \u00e9xito personal y familiar; as\u00ed  su principal desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente, para responder a una clientela que la espera con la demanda de muchos art\u00edculos, que aunque Denis les vende,   no lo hace de manera oportuna, porque espera recuperar el dinero de sus cuentas por cobrar para dar curso a sus pedidos.   ","en":"Denis is 51 years old. She lives with her husband in the southern part of town, and she has two children aged 22 and 26. She sells merchandise from catalogs or specialized guides through which she offers her products such as women's, men's and children's clothing and shoes. Denis started her business with the drive to get an income, because she wasn't able to find a job. Self-employment made that possible for her through what is currently her business. Her aim is to become the leader of her area and although she has come very close to achieving that, her mother's health has required a lot of attention. However, she still dreams of reaching that goal, because through this business she has been able to support her children's well-being. Her Kiva loan is the first loan she requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase women's shoes and products featured in her catalogs at special discounts. She wants to make an impact on her customers with cosmetics and perfumery they can afford, and that's exactly the reason why her Kiva loan appears to be a successful investment. Her main goal is aimed towards her children being able to finish college, so they can boost their success, both on a personal and on a family level. Therefore, her main challenge is not having enough working capital to serve a clientele that awaits her with orders for many items. Although Denis sells these items, she doesn't do it in a timely fashion, because she waits to collect the money from the payments that are due before she places the orders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1127730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Velikaya Znamenka in the Zaporozhski region of Ukraine. He started a business with his wife in 2002. In the beginning they were selling plastic sheeting from a truck, then started a market stall where they sold seeds and then finally were able to rent a store space of their own. Currently the two own three stores, one in Velikaya Znamenka and two others in Kamenka. Their store sells agricultural goods and equipment: fertilizer, pesticide, seeds, plastic sheeting for greenhouses etc. Their store is popular and has regular clients. Anatoliy and his wife work hard and because of that are successful. They are not planning to stop and want to always improve and expand their business.\r\n\r\nAnatoliy wants to invest 20,000 griven from Kiva by purchasing additional goods for sale. He has an agricultural degree and a lot of experience in this profession. In the summer season there is a lot of demand for fertilizer and pesticide in the regions, and Anatoliy wants to be sure to buy quality products in sufficient amounts so that his clients have everything they wish to buy on hand.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1127518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a batch of goods for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Velikaya Znamenka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.441667 34.345556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-06-27T06:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-27T06:30:04Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatoliy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-28T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594732},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301428227},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308188493},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419592},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323024690},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331160837},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339545719},{"amount":750,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347095569}],"funded_date":"2012-07-19T20:28:53Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:39:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":443004,"name":"Arlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlyn is 40 years old and lives in Maloro, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

Sadly, for a number of reasons, Mirian separated from her partner some years ago.  She now puts all her efforts into providing for her family.  She has always been a very hard-working, determined and enthusiastic woman.  Unfortunately, owing to her need to work and cover her expenses, she was not able to study for a college degree.  However, she would have liked to have studied for a degree in Education.  In her free time, Mirian enjoys going for walks through the welcoming streets of her city together with her children.\r\n\r\nThanks to her family's support and her great desire to do well in life, Mirian set up her own business some years ago raising and selling pigs.  She works approximately eight hours a day, every day, in her business.  Early every morning, she goes out to her pens to clean, feed and care for her pigs.  She is happy with the work that she does because she has always enjoyed raising animals.\r\n\r\nMirian is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy feed for her pigs.  She will also vaccinate her young pigs.  This means she will be able to feed her animals and keep them in good condition.  She hopes to be able to increase her sales and income so that she can increase the number of pigs she sells.  In this way, she will be able to guarantee her children's future and well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1128018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She started her business two years ago in some rental rooms. She lives with her husband and her son in a ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family owns a house, which she inherited from her parents, but it is old and uncomfortable to live in. Also, it emits heat through the walls and corners. It has become the main reason why she spends too much for coal and other fuels. So, that is why she wants to repair her house walls by installing insulation. She needs some building materials such as bricks, cement, rock, wool and other insulation materials. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities.  Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons Mongolia has so much air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is taking out will be used to buy materials for her house's wall insulation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1127341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

It is the administrative, financial and cultural center of the region, being the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a strange reference to Talca in Chile in a phrase which goes 'Talca, Paris and London'.  There are a number of myths surrounding this phrase. Some say that it comes from something an Englishman once said (\"Talca parece Londres\" - \"Talca is like London\") owing to the fog that frequently covers the city during the winter season, just as it does in the UK capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1127622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has a one hectare lot where he grows cotton and vines.  He gets up early every morning to work on his land.  In addition, he also works as a day laborer on a large farm near his home.  Pablo feels happy doing the work he does because he has always really enjoyed farming.\r\n\r\nPablo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he will be able to buy wood, poles and wire to replace his vine supports.  This will create better conditions for his crops and they will develop satisfactorily.  This will enable him to sell his crops and increase his income which he hopes to gradually use to finish building his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1128031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Irina works at the Central market and sells women's and children's clothing - dresses, tunics, and blouses. She owns her retail location and has 17 years of experience in this trade.\r\n\r\nLast year, Irina encountered some difficulties - a sharp decline in the volume of sales, together with a fluctuating currency exchange rate that increased the cost of her merchandise.

She is widowed and lives with her daughter in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. She owns an apartment with 2 rooms. It is one of the old apartments which were built during the socialist era and most of them have never had any complete repair in the past years. So do, her apartment never had any big repair or renovation for many years.  This causes heat loss and emissions through the walls and windows. In the winter, she and her daughter feel very cold and always have cold or flu due to the cold rooms.  She  usually uses a furnace that uses coal to stay warm.  Tsendsuren wants to make a big repair to her house. This will include wall insulation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars which run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Tsendsuren is taking will be used to cover the cost of the insulation materials and installation for her apartment repair.

He has been working for 9 months. His salary is not so good and it does not meet with his monthly necessities often. He lives with his wife, a student, and his daughter in his old house which is in the ger district, an area of city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Currently, his job is the main income source for his family. \r\n\r\nZolbayar's house has too much heat loss and emissions in winter. This is caused by old, bad walls and some other parts of his house and it costs much in coal fuel to warm his home. His daughter, 2, always has flu in the winter time. So, Zolbayar planned to repair his house. To start, he is planning to add wall insulation with bricks and cement. He thinks this will keep his home warm and there will be no more emissions after the insulation. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Zolbayar is taking will be used to buy and install insulation for his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1127325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is married to Benjamin, a driver, and is the mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMerlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerlinda hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1127415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

","en":"Luis is 50 years old.  He started his business ten years ago together with his mother when he arrived in this city from Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, and set up a general store as his sales location.  He also distributes merchandise all over the city to customers who pay on credit.  Through this business, he has managed to cover his household expenses.  Luis buys from a third party which raises his costs and so he needs to make more effort to sell his merchandise.  His goal is to be able to buy directly from manufacturers so that he can bypass the middlemen and lower his costs.  This would allow him to be more competitive.  Luis is currently applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy fabric and also men's, women's and children's shoes and clothing to fill his customers' orders.  His Kiva loan will increase his working capital and he will be able to respond to his buyers in a more timely fashion.  His customers remain loyal to his business because of his kind, genuine service.  Luis faced his biggest challenge when he arrived in this city because he had to adjust to its Caribbean culture which is different from the Andean culture.  He had to adapt to a change in climate and a different social environment.  These days he feels very comfortable as he has managed to break into the market and has possibilities of expanding his business and capturing existing potential demand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1128796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She also enjoys eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious 'carapulcra con sopa seca'.  Owing to her parents' lack of financial means, Ana was only able to study up to the fifth year of her secondary education.  However, she would have liked to have studied for a degree in Administration.  \r\n\r\nAna works in her business selling household goods such as irons, pans, rice cookers, plates etc with a lot of enthusiasm.  She works around 8 hours a day in her business and is able to serve up to 15 customers.  She believes that her business is doing well because she is very friendly with her customers.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy merchandise for her business such as plates, jugs, cups, pans, etc.  This will allow her to have a wider range of products available with the 'patriotic holidays' period approaching.  She will be able to improve her income and also her quality of life.  She will be able to continue working towards fulfilling her biggest dream: to have a large store and provide her children with a better education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1128806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

","en":"62-year-old Nelly makes \"pasteles\", a typical Colombian pastry consisting of a mixture of dough or rice with vegetables, meat and other ingredients, which are wrapped in bijao leaves (similar to banana leaves), tied and then cooked. This business is a result of the tradition started by her mother, who remained in this line of work for many years and, when she passed away, Nelly carried on with her business. Many of her family members work in this micro-enterprise; they're in charge of food preparation and commercial distribution of the products. Thanks to this business Nelly has succeeded in getting her family ahead. Today she owns a house of her own and feels like an accomplished woman and an important member of her family. Her goal is to keep on working tirelessly in order to achieve more and more happiness and well-being for herself and for her family.

Because of her hard work Rabiya now has one milk cow, two heifers and one bull as well as the sale of milk and dairy products to the local dairy factory which brings around 6,000 som a month.\r\n\r\nWith a goal to further grow her business Rabiya has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy two cows. She plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of her livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1128212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shopokov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938682},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862867}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T00:10:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":443645,"name":"Lilya","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b  \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 15 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c.\n\n\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 7,000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 -
