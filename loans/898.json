","en":"51-year-old Nicolasa lives with her husband in the southwestern part of town. She has three children ranging in age from 24 to 29, and she dreams of seeing them become very successful people. She does a little of everything in order to get an income that supports the welfare of her household. On one hand, she makes bedlinen, and on the other hand she sells shoes on credit to selected customers as well as dairy products and cold cuts. Ever since she was very young, she arrived in town and worked in many family homes. Later on, she worked for dressmaker's workshops and then she finally decided to start her own business venture, because she didn't have enough time to protect and care for her family. For that reason she started her business by offering her labor to her neighbors. She had support from her husband, who has been a truck loader for an important company for a long time. She gradually succeeded in getting regular customers, and she started using her own resources to invest in supplies and develop her own designs. That way she kept growing and adding other merchandise little by little, such as shoes, dairy products and cold cuts. That is to say, anytime she's presented with the possibility to make money through sound investments, she's up for it, because her will to work allows it and she always demands more and more from herself. Currently, her growing clientele has resulted in more orders for merchandise. She can't meet them in a timely fashion as she would like to, because she has to wait to collect the money that's currently in the hands of her customers. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to purchase fabric, thread, whey and shoes.

She is 49 years old and lives with her 29 year old son and father in law (85 years old). Geghetsik has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeghetsik has 2 milk cows. She produces cheese and sells it in the village. She sells the harvest to local dairy products wholesalers. Ther total average monthly income of the family is 350 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeghetsik has requested credit for start-up of a new agricultural business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit, Geghetsik will purchase up to 30 calfs.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the community of Patachaj, San Crist\u00f3bal Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala, in December of 2011, a group of 13 entrepreneurial women decided to form the Chucuxcabel Trust Bank, which is now about to begin its second loan cycle. Most of the women in the Chucuxabel Trust Bank are engaged in animal husbandry, weaving, embroidery and garment making, among other activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the 13 women in this Trust Bank is Santos, a 33-year old mother of three (two boys and one girl). While Santos herself was never able to attend school, she is happy to share that two of her children are already in primary school, which makes her very proud. In addition to running a small weaving business, Santos is currently engaged in animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan from Friendship Bridge, Santos began raising pigs. She started small, with only one pig, which she eventually sold for money that she put towards her children's education. Thanks to this first loan, Santos was also able to save some money, which she plans to combine with her second loan from Friendship Bridge to buy three more pigs, as well as thread for her weaving. Before Friendship Bridge, Santos had been unable to receive loans from formal banks, due to of her lack of education. This severely limited her ability to run a successful business. Now, thanks to Friendship Bridge, Santos has access to working capital and is thankful for the opportunity to overcome her difficult situation. \r\n\r\nSantos's dream is to see her business grow and provide more money for her family. She wants to, one day, have a bigger farm and build her own home (as she is currently renting). Santos meets with her Trust Bank once a month for training, where they participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons, combined with their loans, help them to provide a better life for themselves and their families. The women of Chucuxcabel are grateful for the people who trust in them, enabling them to obtain loans for their businesses and overcome the poverty that surrounds them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1127734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 3 pigs, and thread for weaving.

engaged in clothing production, animal husbandry, and weaving, lives Mar\u00eda and her family. Mar\u00eda is a 30-year old married mother of two. Although Mar\u00eda was only able to attend school through sixth grade, she now has high hopes for the future of her children. \r\n\r\nFor many years Mar\u00eda and her husband have run a small business making garments. It was not until three years ago that Mar\u00eda realized that, in order for her business to continue to grow, she would need additional funding. As her clients\u2019 demands for her product increased, Mar\u00eda knew she would need to buy more raw materials than she could currently afford. As Mar\u00eda explains, \"we must seize the opportunities presented to us and not ignore them, because they only come once.\"  It was at this point that Mar\u00eda decided to join Friendship Bridge\u2019s Microcredit Plus program. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda recruited other women in her community to join with her and founded the Vision Trust Bank. Mar\u00eda is very happy and proud of herself and her fellow Trust Bank members for having the courage to take out loans and invest in their businesses. Mar\u00eda\u2019s loan has ensured that she and her husband always have the necessary materials on hand to produce what their clients order. Mar\u00eda's greatest achievement has been to provide employment for three more people (one woman and two men), meaning her microloan not only impacts her and her family but also her community.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Mar\u00eda plans to buy different types of fabrics and thread to diversify the products that she can produce. She currently delivers 25-30 orders of garments to her suppliers twice a month. Mar\u00eda\u2019s Trust Bank is about to begin its fifth loan cycle, providing nine women with funds that will help them develop their businesses. In addition to receiving loans, these women meet once a month to receive training from Friendship Bridge and to discuss topics such as business management, budgeting, self-esteem and health. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their family\u2019s health, but also foster a community of support among the women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1127704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

The youngest is a schoolgirl and studies at the village school, the 20-year-old daughter is a university entrant and the eldest is a student. Izolda and Arsen run an agricultural business. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small dairy farm with two milking cows. They produce dairy products: cheese, curds and yogurt. Part of the dairy food is used by the family and the rest is sold at the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 500 Lari. They don\u2019t have enough income to save enough to finance the studies of their three children.

He lives in Parcona district in the province of Ica, Peru.  The district is known for its warm and welcoming climate as well as for the crops that are grown there, most notably asparagus, grapes, and cotton.  The district is also known for being the location of the \u2018bosque de piedras\u2019 [\u2018stone forest\u2019], which contains rock formations that are shaped like animals, people, and other forms.  Nelson enjoys playing football with his friends from his neighborhood, and also likes sampling one of his favorite dishes, \u201cTallarines Rojos\u201d [\u201cred noodles\u201d].  Nelson was only able to study up through his fifth year of secondary school due to his parents\u2019 limited economic resources, but he would have liked to have pursued a career in administration.  \r\n\r\nNelson makes a living as a motorcycle taxi driver, which enables him to help his family with the household expenses.  He typically works about 10 hours a day, and can provide his services to as many as 30 customers in a day.  He believes that his business is going well because he drives very responsibly, and most importantly, because he is very pleasant to his customers.  \r\n\r\nNelson is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since their support will make it possible for him to repair his work vehicle.  His motorcycle taxi consumes a lot of gasoline and oil, and so he is going to tune up the engine and also do general maintenance work.  These repairs will ensure that Nelson has a vehicle that is in good condition and works better, and that he can continue helping his family with the household expenses and keep working toward achieving his greatest dream: to have his own house and own a large business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1128932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to do general maintenance work on his motorcycle taxi and get an engine tune-up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-28T04:50:52Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-28T04:50:52Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":92.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":75.52,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298693},{"amount":31.19,"local_amount":77.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351417},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":81.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":86.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109061},{"amount":34.01,"local_amount":85.01,"processed_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":90.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345245},{"amount":35.28,"local_amount":88.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":94.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954459},{"amount":36.81,"local_amount":92.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":98.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088862}],"funded_date":"2012-06-28T08:25:45Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":443314,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martin is 27 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala South region of Uganda.

En su tienda vende diariamente  de contado y compra tambi\u00e9n de contado, semanalmente, quincenalmente y mensualmente,  de acuerdo a la rotaci\u00f3n de cada uno de sus productos. En los alrededores de su negocio,  todos coinciden en ir a comprar en la tienda de Ana, porque es un lugar ameno y agradable, pues se sienten muy bien atendidos y esta percepci\u00f3n se extiende cada vez mas entre su clientela. Por eso en la mediada en que su negocio crece,  comprar de contado y en mayor volumen se vuelve cada vez mas, un desaf\u00edo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual   Ana Ha recurrido a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para acceder a un credikiva, mediante el cual surtir\u00e1 su negocio de art\u00edculos que mas rotan diariamente, porque necesita tener un buen inventario para responder de inmediato a su clientela, que son las madres de familia que compran para preparar los alimentos de su familia. Su credikiva lo invertir\u00e1 en comprar refrescos, bebidas, l\u00e1cteos, enlatados, embutidos, aceite, arroz, legumbres y caf\u00e9. Su credikiva planea ser exitoso, porque lo hace en base a la demanda de su mercado y porque comprando en mayor volumen y de contado, ganar\u00e1 descuentos, que proporcionan sus proveedores, por este estilo de compra y esto es muy bueno para los ingresos de Ana.    ","en":"Ana, 49, has a store where she sells groceries, beverages, meats, dairy products and all kinds of goods for the family shopping basket.  Every day she sells on a cash basis and also buys her products in cash, weekly, biweekly and monthly, depending on product turnover.  Everyone living nearby coincides at Ana's store because it is a nice, friendly place and they feel well cared for, which is a growing sentiment among her clientele.  Therefore, as her business grows, buying more volume in cash becomes increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\nThis is why Ana has turned to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for a CrediKiva loan.  This will allow her to keep a stock of the daily consumption products, since she has to have enough inventory to respond immediately to her customers, who are mothers who must prepare food for their families.

This small loan (currently Lesya is requesting 10,000 griven) will help her purchase the necessary items - summer shorts and shoes.

Plumbing Services, after working with major plumbing companies. John first entered the plumbing business at the age of 16 when looking for a summer job. Thereafter, he joined the Air Force where he attended plumbing classes to learn more. Upon leaving the Air Force, John received his plumbing license. He also helped build an Arizona start-up business to an established cooperation, but he was fired shortly after. That company later went out of business. After being fired from that job, John realized he could work for himself. \n\nJohn has now been in business for two years. For the time being, he works in conjunction with a helper. Passionate about work ethic, John would like to hire another person but won\u2019t until he finds the right one. He says it\u2019s easy to find a licensed plumber but it\u2019s a challenge to find a licensed plumber who wants to do the job right. According to John, all his employees should properly execute a job, clean up after themselves and be honest with customers. \n\nTo help with his expectations, John purchased a jetter with the funds he received on approval from Accion Texas Inc. He used the rest of the money to market his company. A jetter works similar to the water hoses at car wash stations but is much smaller as it is designed for pipes and drains. Other companies may bring a cable to expand a pipe\u2019s passage after buildup gained from years of usage; however, that only treats the symptom for possibly half a year. The jetter John purchased sprays 3,000 pounds of water to clean pipe walls, which should keep pipes clean for two to three years.\n\nThe Accion loan allows for an opportunity to build credit for his business; without it, John says he would have to wait another two to three months to earn enough money to purchase the jetter, which  would put a stop to the quality he can provide his customers.

Construction is operated in Fort Worth, Texas by 37-year-old Israel. Specializing in concrete, Israel works only on outdoor projects, such as foundation work, patios and outdoor kitchens. Benu Construction also creates concrete stamps to add d\u00e9cor to residential and commercial buildings.\n\nOriginally from Mexico, Israel struggled with English when he moved to Texas - which hindered his job search. Since he was unsuccessful in finding a job, Israel said he had to create a job for himself, which led to the creation of his construction company.\n\nDepending on the size of the project, Israel employs from one to ten people. He employs two full-time and ten part-time workers. Israel works with the client instead of a general contractor because he does not have enough capital to do that. However, working this way allows for more one-on-one communication between him and his client and brings better results.\n\nA returning client, Israel first found out about Accion Texas Inc. four years ago through the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, but he didn\u2019t apply for his first loan until he moved to Houston.  This is Israel\u2019s third loan. He plans to use it mainly to purchase cedar wood and concrete, but also to obtain concrete dyes and a concrete sealer.\n\nThe loan will give him job security, Israel said, as he will earn enough capital after his current project to go straight into work on another job. \n\nIsrael, who is the sole provider for his wife and child, also has a website for his company.

I am studying towards a Bachelor of Business Administration through Maharishi University of Management facilitated by The Maharishi Institute. After graduation I hope to open a business in the community I am from and assist youth in career development.  I believe education is the key to ensuring a brighter future for me and my family.  I come from a large family and rely on my grandmother's state aid because both my parents are unemployed. \n\nI am the first person to attend university in my family, which is a responsibility I take very seriously. I hope to make education more accessible to my siblings through my own education. Through the business I want to open, I hope to empower myself, my family, and the greater community.

This is his story:\n\nMy name is Thabang and I am from Soweto on the outskirts of Johannesburg. I have spent most of my schooling career in Mpumalanga and returned to Soweto late in senior school. As the only person in my family who is going to university, I am responsible to ensure that I make the best of my studies at Maharishi Institute. My education plays an important role helping me achieve my personal goals. With the help of Kiva, I will be able to complete my education and be one step closer to making my dreams a reality.  \n\nI am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration through Maharishi University of Management facilitated by The Maharishi Institute and hope to graduate in 2013. In my spare time I enjoy reading, watching movies and spending time with friends. After graduating, I would like to open a business to serve my community in Mpumalanga. Giving back to my community is very important to me, and with a sound education I believe that I will be able to contribute in a meaningful

I am the first in my family to attend university and my goals after graduation are clear and focused on allowing me to be financially independent and support my family. My intentions are to gain work experience and eventually open up an agricultural business to supply local and national markets. In the future I hope to encourage young people who are addicted to drugs or are victims of peer pressure to pursue their dreams and reach their goals.  \n\nThe Kiva loan is important to me because coming to school is a challenge and focusing on my studies is difficult when I have financial worries in my mind.

This is her story:\n\nMy name is Porter and I am a student at the Maharishi Institute. I am 24 years old and currently studying towards my Bachelor of Business Administration through Maharishi University of Management facilitated by The Maharishi Institute.  Education is important to me because it encourages me to think about life in a creative and innovative way. Sharing my experiences and what I have learned is part of my life. I believe that through sharing we grow in our minds and hearts. \n\nThe Kiva loan will help me to complete my education and continue sharing in a meaningful way. \n\nIn my spare time I enjoy meeting new people, cooking, baking, yoga and meditation. My family and I are Christians and regularly attend church. My mother has been able to educate two of my brothers and continues to support me. Obtaining funding from Kiva will help me ease her burden.

Each member of the group carries out their own business activity with a view to earning a little extra money to help their husbands with their household expenses and provide her family with a better quality of life.  The main business activities in this community are growing sugar cane and collecting resin from rubber trees.\n\nArianna is one of the members of this group.  She is 25 years old and has a high school education.  She is married to Jose Luis who works as an agricultural laborer and the couple have one son.  Arianna tells us that her parents taught her to work when she was very young and when she got married she decided to find a way to help her husband with their household expenses so that they could save up and give their children a better life.  For a little over two years, Arianna has been running a small grocery store in her home.  She tells us that, at first, it was difficult to attract customers but she didn't become discouraged.  On the contrary, she attracted customers by providing good customer service and keeping her business stocked.  She is very happy with her store because she can work without having to neglect her family.  Even her husband helps her to serve the customers.  A loan from  Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad would help her to buy soap, oil, beans, rice, soup, toothpaste, napkins, sweet treats and soft drinks so that she can re-stock her business.  She hopes that, as a result of this investment, her business will continue to grow because she would like to be able to pay for her son's future education.\n\nThe other members of this group

They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy spare parts and accessories, as well to maintain the motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarolina dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. These meetings also give her an opportunity to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1128110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This communal bank, called \u201cEmerging Sun\u201d, is composed of 15 entrepreneurs who are dedicated to commerce, specifically selling clothing, doughy bread, sweets, breakfasts, services, and a stallholder, among others. They all live in the commune of Quilicura, located in the city of Santiago. \r\n\r\nYesinia, president of the communal bank group, is standing in the front row of the photo, first on the left, dressed in a white 'beatle', under a gray vest and a brown jacket. Her dark chestnut hair is worn loose.\r\n\r\nYesinia has offered hair care for some 2 years. She has taken specialized courses that helped improve her skills and facilitated her business. She works Monday through Friday from 10:00 am until 9:00 pm, and also visits her customer's residences.\r\n\r\nYesinia buys her merchandise from various distributors who specialize in selling products for the hair. With this loan she will buy scissors, shaving implements, capes, caps, and gloves, among other items. One of Yesinia's goals for her business is to have an opportunity to acquire her own shop where she can attend to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband, a taxi driver, and her 7-year-old daughter who is a student. Yesinia's personal dreams are to have her own house and her own beauty shop, to generate greater income and thus, obtain a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nYesinia is very content and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza to invest in her business. In addition, she feels very comfortable with her group, since they are united, respectful, and confident.\r\n\r\nQuilicura is a commune pertaining to Santiago, Chile's capital, located in the extreme northeast of the metropolitan region. The origin of the commune's name comes from \u201cmapudungun\u201d in the Mapuche language: \u201ckila\u201d means 3, and \u201ckura\u201d means stone, which we deduce makes the name \u201c3 stones\u201d. The name was chosen by the original inhabitants, with reference to 3 hills that are clearly visible and mark the boundaries of the commune.

She started her business as an employment alternative for herself and her sister, because they could not find another opportunity to work within the educational system. They started out with very few children, but as word spread about the service they offered and the facilities they had for children, they grew quickly. Gradually, the needs of the community grew, and they asked her to become licensed to be able to teach primary grades. Today they are set up to be able to do so, and they have 80 children enrolled. As a faculty member, Iluminada makes sure the children are treated well. They want to grow the infrastructure of the school, which is why she has applied for a loan from kiva, the first loan she has taken out through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she will buy teaching tools for child development, process paper work and make adjustments to the facilities so that with each day their facilities become more comfortable and full of happy children. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1129019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy teaching tools for child development, process paper work and make adjustments to the facilities.

Do\u00f1a Jose explains that she was with the group, left for a while, and then returned and rejoined the group.  This time she is requesting a loan in order to buy two pigs.  She says that if she had a little extra money, she would buy blocks and sheets of lumber for building a pen since has no place to keep the animals at the moment.  Do\u00f1a Jose says that this is the first time she will be raising pigs, so she is very pleased to be starting this activity because she wants to help her husband with the household expenses.  Her only difficulty at the moment is that she does not have a pen to hold the pigs, but she hopes to get a loan in order to build one.  For Do\u00f1a Jose, one of her goals is to see her children finish their studies so that they can have better opportunities in life.  She would like to see them study for a degree.

These attractions, among others, allow us to admire and enjoy the magnificent Nazca culture.\r\n\r\nFredesvina has five children, ages 37, 33, 33, (twins), 24, and 15.  Fredesvina has known how to get her children ahead by herself.  This is because the father of her children abandoned her.  From that moment on she was mother and father to her children.  It is for them that she has worked and continues working.  She does this especially for her youngest child in order to give him a decent life and so that he becomes a good person.  The older children have already started their own lives.\r\n\r\nWhen Fredesvinda has free time she really likes to eat one of her favorite dishes \u201cSeco de Res\u201d [beef stew], which is delicious.

Its members work in agriculture and raise animals. \r\n\r\nYolanda is a farmer and grows soft maize, beans, potatoes, peas, and berries. In addition she raises livestock: pigs, sheep, and chickens. She is requesting a loan to buy seeds, fertilizers, chickens, and feed. With the help of these funds, she will be able to buy more animals to increase her earnings. \r\n\r\nShe buys and sells in San Miguel on Thursday every week. Her dream is to be able to give an education to her children so that they can have professional careers. \r\n\r\nIn her free time she likes to watch television, walk around town, and enjoy Carnaval parties and festivals for the patron saints Michael and Francis.

elabora con sus propias manos artesan\u00edas, como individuales, llaveros,  accesorios pintados con diversa t\u00e9cnicas y resinados. Ella dese muy joven se capacit\u00f3 en confecciones, cuando estudiaba en un colegio administrado por  monjas y all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 este arte, que le ha servido para potencializar su talento y desarrollar su propia fuente de ingreso y empleo. Cuando inici\u00f3 lo hizo con varias mujeres de su barrio, organiz\u00e1ndose en una cooperativa  y cada una aport\u00f3 su propia m\u00e1quina, las cuales ubicaron en un local, e iniciaron la producci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir;  aunque este proyecto dur\u00f3 muy poco, le dio las bases para tomar de \u00e9l su experiencia e independizarse;  en un principio se sinti\u00f3 desanimada, pero no tard\u00f3 en tomar sus propias riendas y confeccionarle a vecinos, familiares, amigos, que gradualmente le fueron refiriendo a otras personas con necesidades de su servicio, hasta que estructur\u00f3 su hoy clientela fija. Como Zoraida tiene un gran potencial creativo que muestra en sus dise\u00f1os, ha logrado agregar valor a su trabajo, pues ha realizado cursos de artesan\u00edas que le han facilitado trabajar acabados con excelencia y tambi\u00e9n como fue patrocinada por una multinacional en su formaci\u00f3n en las artes y t\u00e9cnicas para ser aplicadas a manualidades, ella se organiz\u00f3 con otras mujeres para producir,  aprovechando los empleados de la empresa patrocinadora, los cuales han convertido en su  clientela actual, que han ido conquistando poco a poco con las bellas artesan\u00edas y manualidades a las cuales les aplican las t\u00e9cnicas aprendidas y producen sus propios ingresos.  En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante la cual comprar\u00e1 hilos, adornos, telas, pinturas, madera, e iraca; su cr\u00e9dito es potencialmente exitoso porque est\u00e1 fundamentado en pedidos que le han hecho los empleados de la multinacional que la patrocin\u00f3, que tienen gran estabilidad laboral,  a quienes les responder\u00e1 con un surtido de sabanas elaboradas por sus propias manos y con ello crecer\u00e1 cada vez mas.    ","en":"Zoraida, 45, works making clothing and handicrafts by hand such as place mats, key chains, and accessories painted with different techniques and resinated products.  She became accomplished in sewing from a very young age, when she studied in a school run by nuns and learned this art, which has served her to make the most of her talent and develop her own source of income and work.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she did it with several women in her neighborhood.  They organized themselves as a cooperative and each one brought her own machine, which they got a place for and started producing clothing.  Although this project didn't last very long, it gave her a foundation for her experience and she went out on her own.  At first she felt discouraged, but she didn't waste any time taking control of things and making clothes for neighbors, relatives, and friends, who gradually started referring her to other people who needed her services, until she formed her current steady clientele. \r\n\r\nZoraida has managed to add value to her work because her great creative potential shows in her designs.  She has taken arts and crafts courses that have enabled her to do excellent finishing touches.  Also, she was sponsored by a multinational company in her art and technical courses to be applied to handicrafts.  She organized herself with other women to produce, making the most of the sponsoring company's employees, who have become her current customers.  They have won them over little by little with the beautiful handicrafts to which they apply the techniques learned, and they produce their own income.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy thread, decorations, fabric, paint, wood, and \"iraca\" straw.  Her loan is potentially successful because it is based on requests from the employees of the multinational company that sponsored her.  They have stable work, and she will respond to them with a supply of her handmade sheets, with which she will keep growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1128945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy thread, decorations, fabric, paint, wood, and \"iraca\" straw.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T04:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T04:10:09Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54072},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58834},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60207},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61612},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":63049},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64520},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66026},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71680}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.44,"local_amount":54072,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":58559.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395496},{"amount":35.3,"local_amount":58834,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63717.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775284},{"amount":36.13,"local_amount":60207,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":65204.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387285},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":61612,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":66725.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994115},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":63049,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68282.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130476},{"amount":38.72,"local_amount":64520,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":69875.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519349},{"amount":82.62,"local_amount":137706,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":149135.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071190}],"funded_date":"2012-06-29T16:45:03Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":443704,"name":"Nergie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nergie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines.

aged 42, is a sewer in a textile product company in Mongolia. Since 1992 she has been working continuously for this company and she is one of the skilful masters. Her husband works as a plumber.  She lives with her husband and her two children in her common apartment which was built in the communist era in Mongolia. It has two rooms and has never been completely repaired or renovated. Also, much heat is lost through the windows and walls in winter time which is very harmful to their health and money. In winter, Altantsetseg usually uses the furnace that uses smoky coal and other kinds of fuel just to stay warm. Therefore, she has decided to repair her apartment by insulating the walls and windows. The wall insulation will be made from cement, rock wool and other insulation materials. At her calculation, it will cost about 4,000,000 MNT for all the costs.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries. This is due to the long cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families who are simply trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems and also so they can buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and the health of Mongolians. The loan that Altantsetseg is taking out will be used to buy the building and insulation materials to repair her apartment.

He is 63 years old and lives with his 16-year-old son and two grandchildren of 11 and eight years. Anzor\u2019s grandchildren go to school. Anzor has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to fund the start-up of his agricultural business without any success. His loan requests were rejected each time due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family's only source of income of the family is Anzor's monthly salary. He is an agricultural worker in the village. The family's monthly income doesn\u2019t exceed 200 GEL, or approximately 120 USD. It is hardly enough to feed a four-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \r\n\r\nAnzor is requesting this loan through Credo to start a pig farm. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Anzor will purchase piglets and feed.

She plans to reinvest part of those profits into her business, and will save the rest for her children's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1128508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 3 nets of peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T11:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T11:00:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastienne Eugenie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6919},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7176},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7434},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7689},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7947},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8204},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8462},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8719},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8977},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9233},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9491},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9749}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13.84,"local_amount":6919,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7259.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301316101},{"amount":14.35,"local_amount":7176,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7529.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308071985},{"amount":14.87,"local_amount":7434,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7800.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306384},{"amount":15.38,"local_amount":7689,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8067.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914731},{"amount":15.89,"local_amount":7947,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8338.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331046975},{"amount":16.41,"local_amount":8204,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8608.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436773},{"amount":16.92,"local_amount":8462,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8878.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989190},{"amount":17.44,"local_amount":8719,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9148.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622812},{"amount":17.95,"local_amount":8977,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9419.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364436973},{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":9233,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":9687.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842048},{"amount":38.48,"local_amount":19240,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20187.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610075}],"funded_date":"2012-06-29T14:21:36Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T08:55:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":444665,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Isabel, es socia del banco comunal \u201cDulce Vida\u201d del Distrito de Coronel portillo, Departamento de Ucayali.

is 27 years old and single. He is from the village of Nagvazao, West Georgia. Guri's only source of income is his milk cow and he produces an average of 25 kilograms of traditional West-Georgian cheese that he sells in the village. His monthly income does not exceed 200 GEL. Guri has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but his loan requests have been rejected because of his low income and poor living conditions. Guri is in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGuri is requesting a loan from Credo to start a business trading beef and pork. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as high risk borrowers. \r\n\r\nGuri will use his loan to purchase beef and pork from local farmers at wholesale prices and then sell it at the local open market with a price mark-up. His new business initiative will significantly increase his income.

Sear will use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer and gasoline for a water pump, and to hire labor to plow her farmland. Sear hopes that she will increase her cassava crop yield and that the price of cassava will increase to generate more income to improve her standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1128446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and gasoline and hire labor to plow farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T14:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T14:20:07Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sear","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2047500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640874},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1023750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940881}],"funded_date":"2012-06-30T21:24:56Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:05:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":444195,"name":"Lamentation De Geremy Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Edma est la coordinatrice de son groupe Lamentation de Geremy.
