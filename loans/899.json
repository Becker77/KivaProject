He has been growing corn and beans with the help of a friend since he was 15 years old.  He says that his first loan was helpful because he was able to invest in maintaining his crops.  He also used the profits that he made to repair his fences so that he could prevent animals from coming onto his plot of land.  He used his loan to buy the supplies that he needed for growing his corn and beans.  This enabled him to enjoy a good yield at harvest time.  His sales increased and he made better profits.  However, he would like to buy more products in order to further satisfy his customers.  He is requesting a new loan to invest in buying supplies, manure, fertilizers, etc. so that he can sow one 'manzana' (1.68 acres) with beans and another with corn.  Filemon believes that this new investment will be a lot of help as he will be able to keep his business running and further increase his sales with the aim of improving his profits.  His future plans are to repay his loan with the profits that he makes from his harvest.  His immediate goals are to continue working in his business and to expand the area over which he grows his crops.

","en":"Elvia is a humble 52-year-old housewife from Granada.  She is married and the mother of four children.  Only her youngest child is still in her care.  In addition to running her home, Elvia also has a grocery store business.  She started out selling firewood and cooked beans.  Seeing that her business was profitable as it made her daily income, she decided four years ago to set up her own store at home.  She decided to invest in a small grocery store.  With the support of financial institutions, she invested in buying stock so that she could offer her customers a variety of products.  She has the support of her children who help her in their free time.  Her husband and children also give her money to help with the household expenses.  This is another source of income.  Her goal is to keep her business active by selling products that are in high demand with her customers.

She is married and has four children aged 11, 8, 4 and 2 years. In 2009, Darlinda established a business selling wax and local printed cotton. She began her business because when she dropped out of school in form 3, she had to join her mother at work because she did not have anyone to pay her school fees. Working seven days a week and eleven hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) every month from her business. She would like to take out a loan of 5,000,000 SLL.

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry and farming in 2008 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Bukaticha was able to develop her business to contain three cows and four bulls, and have a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Bukaticha requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued development of her business in order to have a future ability to educate her son.

She\u2019d like to have more capital to build a larger corral and hopes that Manuela Ramos will increase loan amounts so that she can invest more and be able to build a small coop for the chickens.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1121168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2012-06-29T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-29T16:40:25Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":509.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294395518},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":509.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301450529},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":509.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308210884},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-01T10:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":509.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315441775},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T09:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":509.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323046897},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-30T09:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":509.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331183081}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T09:22:30Z","paid_date":"2013-01-30T09:47:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":444724,"name":"Jose Anselmo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre, tiene una hija de 10 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en un barrio de la Ciudad de San Pedro Sula.\nJos\u00e9 tiene un negocio de venta de Jugos.

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry and farming in 1995 with an initial sum of 4,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Dilbarkhan was able to develop her business to contain two cows with offspring and have a monthly income of about 5,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Dilbarkhan requested a loan in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of small livestock.

","en":"Begaiym is a participant of the \"Astra\" group.  She is 51 years old and has three children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Begaiym started her own business in animal husbandry and farming in 1993 with an initial sum of 2,000 som (KGS).

She works as a school teacher and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business with an initial sum of 4,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today Nurzat's business contains ten sheep, two cows and two goats, and sales of milk and milk products yield about 2,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Nurzat requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of small livestock.

As a corn farmer, her main challenge is drought. Huon has never been with VisionFund before. She is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 KHR to buy not only fertilizer for her cornfield but also a motorbike as mobile transportation to sell the fish from one village to another village.

festivals and carnivals. In 2002, Helena used her retirement savings to purchase a single inflatable bouncer. The demand for that bouncer was far beyond her wildest expectations. Since then, Jamboree has grown to include ten bouncers, carnival games, and other party favorites. \r\n\r\nAs the owner and administrator, Helena handles the day-to-day paperwork and scheduling while her husband, James, handles the delivery and customer service aspects of the business. Helena has three children ages 23, 15 and 10 and says that her family and even her extended family are involved in the business.\r\n\r\nWith the continuing success of Jamboree Party Rentals, she hopes to expand the rental business to an indoor facility. Currently Jamboree Party Rentals is a seasonal business and weather is a big factor in its success and an indoor facility will allow Helena to host parties throughout the year. She hopes Jamboree becomes a party destination for the entire Detroit metro area. This loan will be used to secure a lease for an indoor facility and to purchase new inflatables, party room equipment and supplies to get the entertainment room up and running."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8550,"image":{"id":1128820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":["Kiva

Badri and his sister are unemployed. Badri requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a small scale business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the pension of Badri\u2019s father and financial assistance from his mother. The total average monthly income of the family doesn\u2019t exceed 300 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, Badri\u2019s family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri requested a loan from Credo to start up a joiner\u2019s workshop. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to countryside rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nBadri has worked as a joiner in the past.

Badri is sure that his start-up business will be successful, as his district recently became quite popular among tourists. Thus, small hostels are being constructed. Badri will supply them with quality furniture for a convenient price. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the income of the family by 100%.

As the main source of income for her family, Gulnara works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's persistent work, her farm today has two cows and further 2.40 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 2,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of sheep and goats. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, in order to have an opportunity to pay for the education of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1129632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

of three children. Kulsaada works with maintenance at the local military base. As an additional source of income for her family, she has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1987, after having started this business with the purchase of a calf. Thanks to Kulsaada's persistent work, her farm currently has two cows and further 1.60 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Kulsaada turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of sheep and goats. Kulsaada plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, in order to be able to pay for her children's education.

As a main source of income for her family, Gulmira has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1980, after having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulmira's persistent work, her farm currently has 5 sheep, 2 cows and further 3.12 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 17,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulmira turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of cattle. Gulmira plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and she dreams of buying a car for her family in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1129672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 50 years old and has two children. In 1990, in search of a source of income for her family, Siynakan started her business of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation with a starting sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to perseverance and persistent work, Siynakan was able to develop her business to a farm that numbers two cows, two calves and 10 heads of sheep and goats, and the monthly income is around 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Siynakan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock.

","en":"Marly thas a store where she sells boxed lunches, groceries, beverages, meat, etc. wholesale. In her neighborhood she is well known and her customers are regulars because she works hard to offer then quality service. She started this business 20 years ago when she lived with her husband, because he had the same type of business. When they separated, she had to look for an alternative to generate enough income to support her 8 children who now are aged 29 to 41. She started selling raffle tickets at a gaming house. Three years ago she was given a display case and later, thinking that her house is on a corner, it occurred to her to open a store. She bought some second hand shelves, taking advantage of the fact that this opportunity existed. With some savings she was able to get together, she stocked her store  with the most popular items, although she had very little working capital. With the help of her daughter, who tended the store while Marly kept working selling raffle tickets, she was able to buy her first refrigerated case and little by little she has stocked her store more. Everything has been due to her hard work, dedication and experience. Today her store is well known in the neighborhood and beyond. She needs a freezer, because she needs to buy meats wholesale and add fish as a new product to offer. She doesn't have anywhere to keep them. That is the reason she is asking for a Kiva loan, the first loan that she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a freezer. Her investment is projetced to be succcesful due to her experience and the gradual growth that her business has had. She will also have a new product to sell that is in demand with the customers. She will also lower the cost of transporting the meat, since she has to buy it daily because she doesn't have anywhere to keep it. Marly's goal is the growth of her business and with that increasing her earnings, to continue offering her family wellbeing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1129099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T13:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T13:00:09Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marly   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78458},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82622},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84550},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86523},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88542},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90608},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92722},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94886},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97100},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":99365},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104624}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":78458,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":80301.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338932},{"amount":47.51,"local_amount":82622,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84563.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395503},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":84550,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":86536.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775289},{"amount":49.75,"local_amount":86523,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":88556.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387292},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":88542,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90622.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994121},{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":90608,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":92737.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130480},{"amount":107.87,"local_amount":187608,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":192016.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519355},{"amount":173.13,"local_amount":301089,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":308164.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071195}],"funded_date":"2012-07-23T21:38:43Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":444409,"name":"Roselyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roselyn is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She learned this art from her mother, who was an expert and started teaching her the trade when she was very young. That is why twelve years ago she decided to use her knowledge to generate her own income, by selling backpacks initially, and gradually hammocks.\r\nThis business has allowed her to contribute to support her family and give them what they need. Her goal and her greatest challenge is having her own capital in order to sell a greater number of hammocks, so that she can help her children even more. \r\nArgeda approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request a Kiva loan because it will allow her to try to gradually increase her working capital by investing in greater amounts of cotton and pine thread for making new hammocks. That way she will build an inventory and will be able to respond to her customers appropriately when they approach her ready to pay. \r\nArgeda is very well-known in San Jacinto for her products' excellent finish. That is why her customers recommend her, and her potential for growth is worth exploring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1129104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase greater amounts of pine and cotton thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T15:40:08Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argeda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90721},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92060},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94209},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96407},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":98656},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100958},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103314},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105725},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108191},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109759}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":90721,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":92852.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338934},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":92060,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395505},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94209,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96422.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775290},{"amount":55.43,"local_amount":96407,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":98672.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387294},{"amount":56.73,"local_amount":98656,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100974.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994122},{"amount":58.05,"local_amount":100958,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103330.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130482},{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":103314,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105741.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519356},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":105725,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":108209.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071196},{"amount":62.21,"local_amount":108191,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":110733.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497413},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":109759,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":112338.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527242}],"funded_date":"2012-06-30T20:58:48Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":444448,"name":"Bedri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bedri is a taxi driver.

Other financing institutions were too far away and demand too many prerequisites. \r\n\r\nOne of Felix's dreams is to construct his own house, which  may be achieved with the help of the present loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1130981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":242.64,"local_amount":1673.37,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1688.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331103836},{"amount":243.49,"local_amount":1679.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382130857},{"amount":238.87,"local_amount":1647.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1662.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439709640}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T04:39:45Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":441897,"name":"Berdi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 12 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0446\u044b, \u0434\u044b\u043d\u044e \u0438 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 2 \u0433\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0439. \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0443 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438.","en":"Berdi has been farming for 12 years.

dollars which were useful to her in acquiring a new motor for a work tool which was generating additional income for her, that is, the taxi, and to purchase a natural gas system for the same vehicle which lowers her fuel costs since gasoline is expensive in our country. The new fuel system and motor have been a beneficial investment, providing a good return for Ms. Nancy's taxi service business. \r\n\r\nCurrently she has finished paying off the loan and with the resources obtained from providing taxi services during this time, she has been able to save up a sum and is purchasing a plot of land from her in-laws in La Maica (she still does not have her own housing and currently lives in her parents' home, and wishes to have her own space for her family). They still lack resources to finalize the purchase and so she is seeking a second loan which will go to cover what she lacks to firm up the purchase of land, and so improve her family's living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1131013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase land from her in-laws.
