Typically she gets paid a flat rate per pound for her bottles; however, with the help of this loan, two very important things will happen. First, she will be able to begin buying bottles from some of the local colmados (corner stores) at a very low rate so that she can turn a higher profit each week. After a few months of the increased profits, she will have enough money saved so that she can submit her paperwork to obtain a legal ID number in the Dominican Republic. Consequently this will help her further, because recognized and legal Dominican residents get paid a higher rate, per pound, for recycled glass material.\r\n\r\nSanta is very grateful to everyone who is helping her to make this loan happen.

In 1985 at the age of 15, she got involved in the world of micro-enterprises.  She had started her business with $50 in initial capital, which had enabled her to buy salted fish to sell.  Her business prospered through 1990.  The political and economic instabilities of the 90\u2019s disrupted her work leading to a drop in business.   In 2000, Kilolo started up again selling used clothing, and she diversified a few years later by including the sale of spices, which she sells today. \r\n\r\nKilolo decided to join a HOPE RDC group named \u201cJoyeux Lutins\u201d in 2008, with the goal of opening a clothing store one day.  She is a loyal client who has received HOPE RDC loans and who has totally repaid them on time.  The last loan she had was used to buy ten trays of eggs, as well as spices to sell in order to grow her revenues.  \r\n\r\nKilolo is divorced and is the mother of four children, ranging in age from 6 to 17.  Three of them are students.  One is in secondary school, and two are in primary school.  Currently, her capital amounts to $100.  Her business generates for her a profit of $48 each week.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":339761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy ten trays of eggs and some spices to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

This confidence is an advantage in increasing her income.  It allows her to update the utensils and machines that she uses to make her delicious snacks.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosa hopes to install in her house a space equipped with all of her indispensable working materials.  She wants to do this to work comfortably and increase her production in order to distribute cakes to some of the stores in her district.\r\n\r\nCooperation and optimism are the characteristics that describe the colleagues she works with in her community bank.  They have had nine loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and each time they improve their incomes.  The 2,000 PEN that she is asking for is to buy utensils and another oven to increase her production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She currently lives with her three children. Two of her children are in college and the eldest is already working.

However, her refrigerator was damaged by the recent flood that hit the entire Manila area, so she has to stop her frozen meat products business for a while because she has nowhere to store her products.  Then she got a loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in the amount of P17,000.00, which she used to start a small sari-sari (general) store.  She now earns more than P10,000.00 a month from the combined earnings of her new business and her earnings from the rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe is working hard to be able to get back her former sources of income.  When her children finish their college education and are able to get decent jobs, Romana wants to go back to the province and stay there for good.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hopes they bring her economic support to improve the conditions of her entire family.  \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":662893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothes and shoes for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-12-12T11:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":591.57,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":645.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191349084},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":559.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":610.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766750},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":559.66,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":610.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209794},{"amount":28,"local_amount":560.05,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":611.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078598},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":557.24,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":607.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147647},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":557.96,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":608.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433183},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":561.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":613.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221598162},{"amount":52.6,"local_amount":1052.09,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226967876}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T21:50:56Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa C","image":null}},{"id":261257,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eugenia C. is a married woman who lives in  Brgy. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a vegetable-farming business. Her husband, Magno, who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are from 19 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nEugenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eugenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nEugenia C. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gracias a su destreza y habilidades en este campo textil trabaj\u00f3 en una tienda muy conocida en la zona, pero eso causaba el descuido de su vivienda, ahora abri\u00f3 su propia textiler\u00eda en casa de su hermana y  esta  aprovechando al m\u00e1ximo esta oportunidad  ya que tiene una buena clientela.Para ella la \u00fanica forma de vivir tranquila sin preocupaciones es trabajando y por esa raz\u00f3n anhela establecer su propia empresa textil y para ello necesita de un capital de dinero que le permita adquirir las herramientas necesarias para poner en marcha su proyecto.Apoyemos a esta madre que con talento y esfuerzo sigue trabajando arduamente para progresar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":95066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials for manufacture (Lace, cloth, buttons, clasps, etc)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T17:15:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T19:49:36Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120139},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140305},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163876},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188865},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216802},{"amount":70,"local_amount":197.65,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":209.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245721}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T19:49:36Z","paid_date":"2008-06-22T09:09:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30973,"name":"Thi Thuynh","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Ms Thuynh is 50 years old, she has 2 children who are working.

She sells vegetables in the May 12 market, which is one of the busiest in the zone of Mi Per\u00fa, where she lives. Epifania has been working in this business for 15 years, during which time she has gained a lot of experience with which she can conduct her work with a lot of efficiency. What she likes most about her work is the interaction she has with people, because she is very kind in her dealings with her clients. Because she works from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening, she gets very tired. In the summer, the heat is unbearable and in the winter, the cold doesn\u2019t allow her to conduct her business as she would like to. Happily, she has learned to fight against these setbacks, because she is a very strong and hard-working woman. Now she wants to expand her stand, by buying more vegetables and renovate it to make it more attractive to her clients. Epifania is an old and very faithful client of Microfinanzas PRISMA, and this is her first individual loan, since before, she was involved in community banks. With the money that she requests, she wants to supply her stand with more vegetables. She will also hire a builder so that she can fix her stand so that it will look better and so that she will be more comfortable when she sells. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":310021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T12:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":197.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":217.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":232.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":244.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":254.28},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":262.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":274.96},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":285.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":297.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":304.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.64},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":205.54,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":207.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596166},{"amount":80.79,"local_amount":248.57,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":250.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990441},{"amount":72.24,"local_amount":222.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211556},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":230.08,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":232.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641060},{"amount":79.11,"local_amount":243.42,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":245.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080520},{"amount":78.66,"local_amount":242.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":244.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996665},{"amount":83.43,"local_amount":256.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":259.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842151},{"amount":439.19,"local_amount":1351.39,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1363.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733810}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T17:14:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T10:46:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":108820,"name":"Lucila Konturnina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lucila  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cAswancaris II\u201d en la  provincia de Azangaro, departamento de Puno, tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente con 03 hijos a su cargo, vive en el Jr. Leoncio Prado  N\u00ba 465 Barrio Vilca Apaza.\n\nTrabaja con el Movimiento Manuela R. casi 03 a\u00f1os, la actividad a la que se dedica es la compra y venta de abarrotes, su primer pr\u00e9stamo fue de S\/ 500.00 nuevos soles.\n\nActualmente ella desea un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/ 2500.00 nuevos soles, el mismo que pagara en 06 cuotas;

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn the photo, Marivic is shown supervising one of her workers operating a power-saw. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in  Brgy. Malis, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Julieta is borrowing PHP 29,500 in order to purchase more stock for her general store. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She was born into a simple family of a farmer and had helped her parents with the household since childhood.  It just so happened that Kulnar got married early, at the age of 15.  She finished school in her native village, but could not continue her education because she gave birth to her oldest son.  During the next ten years, Kulnar became a mother to three more children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Kulnar got a job as a butcher (worker who butchers livestock) at the Kaindinskiy meat processing plant in 1980.  This work was very hard, but Kulnar is a strong woman and worked at the plant until she retired in 2008.  Kulnar's husband worked as a shepherd at the collective farm, named after Panfilov, but got involved in taking livestock to a pasture for local residents when the collective farm feel apart after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Kulnar and her husband used their jointly earned money to create a farm business and provided education for their children with earnings from selling livestock.  At the present time, their oldest son lives with them, and Kulnar takes care of two grandchildren.  Thanks to her persistence and love of hard work, Kulnar's business currently has one dairy cow and one horse.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase thoroughbred horses.  She plans to sell the offsprings.  Kulnar plans to invest the earning from the business into continued breeding of thoroughbred horses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":964985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

P., 45, supports herself by weaving huipiles, the traditional blouse worn by Mayan women. She will use the proceeds of this credit to buy more material. It can take a full month of full time work to make one huipil, and the material normally costs about 75 quetzals, or US$10, but she can sell the finished huipil for about 500 quetzales, or US$65.  She sells her work in the street, and also sells to tourists in a nearby town. She also sells small bags of a nut called \u201caba\u201d for 1 quetzal each (about US$0.08)  and helps in her sister\u2019s  tortilla business. Catarina is separated from her husband, who drank and beat her. She has a total of 7 children ranging in age from 7 to 25. The four younger children live with her. While she is building her own home, they are all  living with a  friend. The house is almost complete, but needs windows and a few other finish items before they move in. \r\nIt has been a long struggle for Catarina but she is persistent. She never had any schooling and speaks only the Cakchiquel language.  Her long-term dream is to be able to open a fruit stand and sell bananas, papaya, apples, pineapples, oranges, and other local fruits. Before receiving micro credits Catarina  had no way to support herself, but now she is on her sixth loan in three years, and she has successfully paid off all previous loans. She says that before receiving the credits she had absolutely no cash and no way to support her family, but as her business has developed she\u2019s very proud of her ability to take care of her children. Perhaps as she is able to continue her success the sadness she feels concerning her family situation and estranged husband will diminish over time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":50158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"She will use the proceeds of this credit to buy more material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Polopo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-07-23T04:05:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-06T14:49:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-09-06T09:32:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51307},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T19:32:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63977},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-06T23:08:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77475},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T00:40:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":92637},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-06T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110458},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129680},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151256},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-04-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":175247},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202510},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229749},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258836},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287580}],"funded_date":"2007-07-23T14:49:17Z","paid_date":"2008-08-06T09:11:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18700,"name":"Senia Ruth","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Senia is the young mother of a 7 year-old girl.

Besides his children, Benjamin also supports two nephews from a deceased brother. \r\n<p>\r\nBenjamin studied until 3rd grade and stopped due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. At the age of 15 years he started fishing with his father, but soon stopped to join the obligatory military service. In 1988 Benjamin was involved in an ambush and lost both legs. Benjamin decided to move to Maputo rather than returning to Matutuine due to the civil war that was intense in the countryside. Benjamin started to repair shoes and only in 1998 started to receive a pension from the government.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004 Benjamin decided to go back to Bela Vista in Matutuine with plans to work in an agricultural field, but the lack of rain didn\u2019t allow him to proceed with his plans. He then went back to repairing shoes and also started to sell used clothes, blankets and duvets in a small stand. Benjamin\u2019s wife goes to South Africa to sell pans and buys the blankets and duvets that are then sold in Mozambique. During wintertime the sale of blankets and duvets intensifies. Benjamin\u2019s wife buys them for MTn 350 and he sells them for MTn 800 each.\r\n<p>\r\nBenjamim is an old client of Hluvuku.

With this new loan, the women buy each week:  one sack of big millet (sorghum), some leavening, firewood, and other supplies for making the local beer.  The women help one another in this work, which demands a sizable quantity of firewood, water, and a lot of attention, so as to produce a quality beverage.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey each earn 10,000 francs CFA in selling the beverage each week.  The biggest sales are made on market days, during which villagers from surrounding areas abound.

What she likes most about her work is that, since her business operates in her house, she is able to split her time between the bookstore and her household duties.  She has had this bookstore for 2 years and believes that the most difficult thing is having to spend many hours in it since it is open from very early and closes late.  For the future, she hopes to increase her business and have better income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Vilma\u2019s second loan with MFP, and she hopes to be able to pay all her payments on time, for she doesn\u2019t want to harm the members of her community bank, where she is highly appreciated because of the happiness that she gives her colleagues.

He is married to Lydia, 48. They have three children: one is in college, the eldest is working and the other stays home.\r\n\r\nPampilo owns and manages a home-based manufacturing business. He makes snack items like banana chips, sweetened puffed corn and fish crackers. He hires an assistant in the work yard.  He earns close to 30,000 Philippine pesos a month. He is happy that one of his children has already finished college and another one is working his way towards graduation. He was also able to purchase property in the province. All these are fruits of his labor.    \r\n\r\nPampilo became an active member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005 and has since been enjoying many benefits from the cooperative. He is currently in need of additional capital for the continuity of his business. He applied for a P30,000 loan with CCT to augment his business needs.\r\n\r\nHe wishes for his small manufacturing station to become a factory soon.  He\u2019s working double time nowadays because he still has two children to get through college.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social-development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar & toothpaste in the local community. Benita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Benita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benita is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Benita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLuz del Futuro\u201d, y este es el sexto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n para que pueda concretar sus planes.

They have three children.  Joel is 20, Wilder is 18, and Gisela is 16.  They live together in their own house in the Puente Paucartambo community  (central Peruvian forest).\r\n\r\nThe dedication that she applies to her work is very important to Felicita.  Thanks to the time she spends on her crops, she is able to have a good harvest during each farming season.  What she likes most about her work are the hours she spends clearing the fields and getting rid of the weeds that grow around her plants.  She has spent 15 years devoting herself to the noble business of farming.  During this time she has acquired much knowledge, and she happy about that.\r\n\r\nHer main crops are coffee and bananas.  She sells them in her own area.  After each harvest she boxes them (a way of canning her fruits).  She then sells them to the wholesale merchants who arrive on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  She is very satisfied with the results that she is getting.\r\n\r\nHer primary desire is to grow more agricultural products that are native to the area.  She has already taken the first step by planting avocadoes and citrus fruits.  The result of this is a good crop that is growing without any significant difficulty.  They will produce their first fruits soon.\r\n\r\nThat is why she is asking for the support from each one of you so that she can step up this business activity.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cLuz del Futuro\u201d (Light of the Future) Communal Bank.  This is her sixth loan with MFP, where she hopes to get your collaboration so that she is able to finalize her plans.  She pledges, once again, to make her payments as she has done with the previous loans she has had.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving your support, Felicita will use the requested money to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer to spread among her coffee, banana, and avocado crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":187.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.16,"local_amount":147.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":152.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550458},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":154.44,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719138},{"amount":60.81,"local_amount":162.16,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350602},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":170.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851042},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":178.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666202},{"amount":70.22,"local_amount":187.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":193.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621337}],"funded_date":"2011-06-14T03:24:57Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":310463,"name":"52.thieu Long.

They both attend school. Nolmy is a very likeable person who works hard in everything she does. She is very happy for the family that she has and she is very happy that every day God provides her with a daily sustenance.

She recently expanded to taking orders for shoes and makeup from the two small catalogs that sit on her glass candy case. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nThe Mayan women of this area mainly speak their native language, Quiche.

This is 43 year old Sophia M. from Mwanza. She is a widow with four children, between the ages of 11 and 23 years old. Sophia M. has been running a Duka business- She owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city where she has been selling common household and grocery items since 2004. Sophia's business is doing well. She works at the business for 13 hours per day, 7 days per week. Sophia currently earns about 350usd from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400usd in order to buy more stock of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and tomato sauces. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Sophia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more stock of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and tomato sauces","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130713},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130714},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027508},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613509},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010588}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T01:16:12Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":88372,"name":"Rejina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rejina D. is a hairdresser who owns a beauty salon at Nyankumasi Ahinkro near Cape Coast.

She is 51 and is the single mother of 7 children who are 30, 27, 23, 23, and 17.  Only the oldest one isn't in school.  She only studied through 4th grade and didn't continue because her mother took her to South Africa when she lost her father.  She lives in her own home with her children and supports a grandchild that lives with her.<p>\r\nShe left Namaacha for Boane in 2007 with her children after having purchased a house because the one where she used to live was rented.  She has had her own business for 17 years and has never had an employee.  She works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.  She sells soft drinks and alcoholic beverages and makes a montly income of 1,000 meticais per day, which she applies to her home's expenses.  She saves 200 meticais on a weekly basis through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.<p>\r\nShe has already had loans with the GueGue Gue Association (a credit cooperative) and later decided not to continue with them for various reasons.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through neighbors.  This is her first loan in the amount of 8,000 meticais, which she will use to purchase products (soft drinks, alcoholic drinks, etc.) to increase the quantity of her merchandise in her business to increase her sales.<p>\r\nIn the future, she hopes to request more loans to construct coops to raise chickens to butcher and to finish building her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":438507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy and sell products (soft drinks, beer, and other drinks)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-03T01:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":351.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":367.43},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":384.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":401.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":419.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":438.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":479.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":523.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":547},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":571.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":597.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":624.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":652.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":682.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.79},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.47},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.81},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.54},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.47},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":28.82,"local_amount":838.36,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":896.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709104},{"amount":29.38,"local_amount":854.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":913.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938251},{"amount":30.8,"local_amount":895.97,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-29T10:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":957.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938252},{"amount":33.68,"local_amount":979.76,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972086},{"amount":33.68,"local_amount":979.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698657},{"amount":35.89,"local_amount":1043.97,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916114},{"amount":82.75,"local_amount":2407.62,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2573.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878534}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T03:30:51Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":162365,"name":"Annarose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annarose S. is from the village of D'ban Calamba Mis.

Ryan Vennyl is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 15,000 PHP ($350), which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in his business. This loan would be the second loan taken out by Ryan Vennyl from GDMPC.

He has been on this particular plot of land for the last 16 years. He has had 6 children, two of whom are still in school and live with him and his wife Vilma. On his farm, he also raises pigs and horses as additional sources of income. He plans to invest all of the loan money in his area of expertise, which is rice farming. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Enrique is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Grow rice on his lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T22:26:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:38:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16570},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:36:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21974},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:19:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29287},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39058},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:48:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39730},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:07:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53279},{"amount":320,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65650}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T22:26:39Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:13:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10540,"name":"Rosario Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario is a 43-year-old married mother of two children, ages 18 and 23.

She decided to repair one of her sowing machines and give it to her eldest daughter so that she could learn this trade alongside her mother. Demand for her dressmaking, especially on the higher end, has increased, and for this reason Rosa Mar\u00eda wishes to acquire a semi-industrial sewing machine and another standard sewing machine to easily satisfy her clients' requests. For this, Rosa Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan of $325, which she plans to repay within six months, with the goal of starting a small business of high-end dressmaking with the help of her daughter.

He has 5 children, the second of whom lives with him. Esteban is a farmer, as he has been his whole life. He likes to grow peas, potatoes, broad beans, etc., but what he never stops growing are potatoes. The potato stock is up right now, which has allowed him to recoup his investment. On the other hand, he has not been growing very many peas due to a lack of funds. Aside from that, he also has cattle that other people look after. He only occasionally checks on his cattle. The most difficult aspect about his work is the high cost of fertilizers because he grows crops on both irrigated land and seasonal plots (according to the rain), which is why he does not have enough money to buy fertilizer. He is a new MFP member. With the money being requested, he will purchase fertilizer at 200.00 PEN a bag.

With this loan request he is going to buy construction materials like cement blocks and iron that are needed to finish the construction of his house, which is currently only made of stone with iron, and his roof is corrugated iron and partly covered with plastic. This loan will be a huge benefit and will help accomplish his goals.

This has become easier alongside her husband, who has provided her with constant support since they were married. Despite living in a rented house, they have not given up their dream of finishing the construction of and moving into their own home. For 6 years Mery has sold cosmetics, a business that she learned in her single days thanks to friends who encouraged her to become a beauty consultant due to its good income. If they sold enough products properly they could take advantage of purchasing offers to later resell the goods at normal price.\r\n\r\nWorking and homemaking at once was a task that Mery couldn't initially accomplish, but over time she became accustomed to her different roles. Thanks to her husband's support her obligations have lessened since they take turns in finishing household chores. Both are currently thinking of opening a bazaar in their home with the goal of improving their financial status and providing their children with the necessary money for their college studies. This is Mery's eighth loan with MFP; alongside her loan group colleagues she learned to assume many challenges and responsibilities and all of them are very timely and orderly with their loan payments. With this 2000-sole loan she will buy more wholesale beauty products to sell at a higher price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shanti Singh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy wholesale merchandise to increase sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":341.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596264},{"amount":117,"local_amount":346.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":355.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990542},{"amount":120.98,"local_amount":358.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":367.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211653},{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":376.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":385.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641174},{"amount":131.63,"local_amount":390.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":399.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080614},{"amount":65.81,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":199.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996739}],"funded_date":"2009-05-21T20:20:06Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shanti Singh","image":286452}},{"id":112964,"name":"Janeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Janeth has owned a small general store in the Kola neighborhood of Morogoro for six months.

They live in polygamous families in the neighborhood of Djaka (Kirango) in Markala, fourth administrative region of Mali. The group members know each other through links of family, marriage, friendship and neighborhood. They make a living from buying, processing and selling fish. Eager to better serve its customers, the Dembagnouman Group has decided to join the credit program offered by SoroYiriwaso. This is the Group's fifth solidarity loan, after having repaid the previous four loans on schedule.\r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy 72 baskets of fresh fish and 100 ice bars, provided by carriers coming from Bamako. They get their fish supply on the banks of River Niger, then they dry part of it on gravel, on straw or on \"seccos\". The fresh fish will be sold on location in Kirango and in Diamarabougou Markala, or kept refrigerated in ice and sold at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and in Bamako. The dried fish will partly be stockpiled until the water level of the river drops in winter and they can sell it at a higher price, and partly be sold in Dougabougou, Siribala, N., Shango and Boussin, as well as at the weekly market in S\u00e9gou. They also sell smoked fish, mainly in S\u00e9gou. Most of their sales are for cash to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n<p>\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 75,500 CFA francs which they will spend on small household expenses and use to take part in social events (baptisms, weddings and funerals).

L. P. is from the village of Dinas, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 28 years old. Mailyn is married and has two infant children. To make a living, Mailyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. Her main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting cassava to sell. Mailyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $38 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mailyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Mailyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 7,000 which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be her 3rd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The need to offer their family good living conditions motivates Joel and his wife to work hard at growing potatoes, peas, and gladioli on their own land. Joel also has a stall in the major city market where he has been selling his products for 7 years, which earns him additional income. He also takes milk from his parents cows in order to help them with selling cheese. These trades allow him to provide all the basics that his loved ones need, and even to recently purchase two hectares of land where he is thinking of growing gladioli. He hopes that the income from his harvest will enable him to buy a house in the city and set-up a store, as well as having his vegetables at his current market stall. This is his fifth loan with MFP, and he states that he will continue to work with this community group with the same commitment as he had when he began. With the loan that he is requesting, he will buy 8 sacks of fertilizer, two bags of peas, and 5 bottles of insecticide. \r\n   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":521022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seed peas, fertilizer, and insecticide.

They have three children who are 18 to 27 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nNora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twenty loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 23,000 PHP helped her to earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, thus uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her twenty-first loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials. She plans to continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Nora is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They earn their livings in various ways, such as general retail and services among other things.\r\n\r\nHere we met Diana, aged 26.  She is single, and lives with her parents.  She is studying Business Management at the Universidad Estatal Del Sur in Manab\u00ed.\r\n\r\nOur friend is a very intelligent and hard-working girl, who in addition to focusing on her studies, also works selling clothes, shoes, costume jewelry and seasonal products.  She is always looking for ways to earn money on a daily basis to help with her studies.  She sells door-to-door, and also sells to her friends at the University.  She works everyday, and provides credit to her customers which she collects on every two weeks.  She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil whenever she needs it.  She has been doing this work for a year now, and it has been going very well for her.  She tells us that this is the foundation for her to be able to continue with her studies.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase more merchandise, such as trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and children's clothing.  This is her first lending cycle with the Communal Bank, and she likes the Bank for the speed with which they are able to give loans.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to finish her studies, and to become a successful professional."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":877561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy trousers, blouses, T-shirts and children's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeth Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marilyn Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Alrexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estrella Leonilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juliana Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2640,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":343300,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 43 years old and married.

She tells us that her most favorite things to do are to work and study.\r\n\r\nBenita has been working in her beauty salon for about six years, which she started after working in one and learning all the techniques. She saved enough money to buy some tools like a hairdryer, brushes, and hair products. Now her little business is set with more tools and clients. She is ready to receive her second loan with Esperanza Internacional, after successfully paying back her previous one.

year-old married woman and a mother of four children.  She has been involved in delivering and selling fabrics for several years.  Her daughter helps her with the business.

She lives with her husband and children. She sells beautiful handicraft items. She learned the skill of transforming simple objects into valuable pieces of art from her parents, items that are very popular among the tourists. She makes different items from key chains, to clay objects that reflect the customs of her people. She manufactures wholesale items to sell to large handicraft shops. She has been an important support for her family for more than 20 years, which encourages her to go on, as she still has to support her last daughter with her higher education. Carmen\u2019s dream is to obtain a certificate to export her products to other countries and for that reason she\u2019s doing training on this matter. This is the third time she requests for a loan from MFP, and all this time she has proven to be responsible with her payments. Carmen will invest on the purchase of more material to use in her handicraft items, such as vases, paint and clay. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena Lopez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":241388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase material for her handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T23:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228226},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423458},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116720},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011651},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595265},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989476},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210719},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640344},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080062},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":200.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996379}],"funded_date":"2008-12-21T02:18:20Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jimena Lopez","image":249667}},{"id":84308,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen P. is married and has three children.
