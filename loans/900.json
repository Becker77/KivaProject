She lives with her husband and her son in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family owns a house which is built from wood, but it has air leaks through the walls and corners. That is the main reason why it costs too much for coal and other fuels, so she wants to repair her house walls by adding insulation. She needs some building materials such as bricks, cement, rock wool and other insulation materials. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buy the building and insulation materials for her house wall insulation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1130409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is a mother of two children and a loving wife. Muyasara has been working as a teacher for the past four years. However, as a teacher's salary today is quite low, she also buys and resells dried fruit. Usually, she purchases fruit in bulk from wholesalers, processes it, and then sells it to her regular customers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Muyasara's loan is to buy 80 apricot trees. She will cultivate them and, together with her children, dry their fruit. Being quite experienced in this business, Muyasara knows that the price of dried apricots will go up in the autumn and winter, and they can bring a good profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1126142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase apricot trees for production of dried apricots","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muyasara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":428.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":430.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":452.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":465.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":474.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":492.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":497.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":522.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":539.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":548.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":564.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":582.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.06,"local_amount":428.54,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":433.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294596378},{"amount":91.41,"local_amount":430.16,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":435.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301429894},{"amount":96.24,"local_amount":452.93,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":458.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308190268},{"amount":98.96,"local_amount":465.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-20T10:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":471.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316391315},{"amount":100.92,"local_amount":475.07,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":481.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323026308},{"amount":796.41,"local_amount":3747.45,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3794.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162395}],"funded_date":"2012-07-01T03:16:15Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":444903,"name":"Evans","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans is 34 years old, married and supports a family of three.

Her activity has grown little by little as she has made agreements with some companies that sell their products by giving specialized products guides or catalogues to retailers like Escilda, who then promote their different items. Escilda has succeeded in obtaining 4 loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, her main working capital provider.

She rents the workshop that she has been using for eight years nonstop. She is widowed and lives with her two daughters and her son in her old and bad house, which is in the <i>ger<\/i> (Mongolian housing tents) district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nFor many years her house has been old and uncomfortable to live in. Also, it has an emission through the walls and corners. She wants to repair her house walls by making insulation. She needs some building materials such as bricks, cement, rock wool and other insulation materials. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters when temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers green loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is taking will used to buy building and insulation materials for her house wall insulation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1130411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He has already been in this business for 11 years. After being in the army he began doing this work for a company. In 2000 he began to work independently. He is doing well in areas of construction and remodeling. \r\n\r\nStepan plans to invest a 21,000 hryvnia loan from Kiva into getting a soldering iron for soldering large diameter pipe, and a more powerful jackhammer (43-45 ft lbs. impact energy) which costs 12,000 hryvnia. Stepan recently received a contract to connect heating and plumbing for a house which will require him to have more professional equipment. Stepan plans to reinvest the money he earns from the contact into his work, using a small part of it for a summer vacation with his family.

Thanks to having more than 25 years of experience in preparing foods, one day she decided to start her own business to have better financial opportunities. She worked for nine years as a chef at a restaurant, and approximately four years ago she started selling food out of her home, and little by little it grew. Currently she offers her customers breakfasts, lunches and many other meals. Of course, she doesn't have the space to set up a restaurant and fit in some chairs and tables. It's for this reason that Maria is requesting a loan in order to make improvements to section off a restaurant in her home and acquire some tables and chairs to start up the business.

She lives in a traditional family in the Pelengana commune of S\u00e9gou (fourth largest administrative region in the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nMariam stopped attending school in her second year of secondary school (Malian education system) to sell condiments and fish (smoked, dried, etc.). She started off working alongside her mother, who sold fish. With eight years of experience, she is very well-known and has many customers. She receives lots of orders from many different places.\r\n\r\nHer fish and condiments are carefully protected from the flies and mosquitoes. Always armed with a fan at the market, she is constantly fanning her goods to make sure that not even one mosquito or fly can touch them.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her capital so that she can meet the demand of her customers and strengthen her business, Mariam turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 36 months now. She has correctly repaid three individual loans. She is now on her fourth individual loan, which she plans to use to buy 1 bag of pepper, 1 bag of garlic, and 1 box of smoked fish. She stocks up in Siribala and Niono.\r\n\r\nMariam sells her goods for cash or credit to a predominantly female clientele. With this loan, she plans to earn a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which she will use to cover some of her family's expenses.

Luego se dedic\u00f3 a varias actividades donde aprendi\u00f3 a administrar negocios. Con la experiencia que ten\u00eda decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio y hace 5 a\u00f1os que tiene su propio negocio de elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de vinos con sabor a uchuva, naranja, maracuya, mora e hidromiel. Adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n produce refrescos de avena en cantidades menores. Gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos tiene muy buenas ventas, pero debido a que tiene la dificultad de poseer capital para crecer con su negocio, busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos y materias primas para elaborar los vinos que le han pedido sus clientes.\n\nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 seguir creciendo con su negocio y ofrecer un buen servicio a sus clientes. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es seguir creciendo con su negocio y tener sus productos en un supermercado; adem\u00e1s de poseer su propio vi\u00f1edo para realizar el proceso de elaboraci\u00f3n del vino completamente. \n","en":"Abelardo is married and has 3 children to whom he has always wanted to give a good quality of life. \r\n\r\nTo generate an income to his home he has a wine making business. He learnt the business about 40 years ago, when he helped his grandmother to sell the wines that she made. He then went on to do many other activities that taught him how to manage a business.\r\n\r\nWith that experience he decided to start his own business and for the last 5 years he has had his own wine making business. He makes Physalis [or peruvian cherry] wine, orange wine, passion fruit wine, black berry wine and mead, he also makes oatmeal drinks in small quantities.\r\n\r\nThanks to the good quality of his products he has very good sales, but due to the difficulty in raising a capital to grow his business, he wants a loan to buy the supplies and raw materials to make the wines his customers have asked for. This way he will be able to continue to make his business grow and to offer a good service to his customers.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to keep his business growing and to sell his products in supermarkets. He also wants to have his own vineyard to be able to do the wine making process from beginning to end.

Debido a que su negocio viene creciendo en ventas, pero no cuenta con un capital suficiente para poderlo hacer crecer, Flor busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita comprar bebidas y otros productos m\u00e1s que ofrece en su bar para surtirlo y ofrecer a sus clientes una buena variedad de productos.\n\nDe esta manera tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de seguir generando los ingresos que se requieren en su hogar para seguir teniendo una buena calidad de vida, adem\u00e1s de poder seguirle brindando a su hijo de 10 a\u00f1os de edad el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n de buena calidad. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es seguir teniendo su negocio ya que este le ha permitido mejorar considerablemente su condici\u00f3n de vida y poder en un futuro generar empleo para los m\u00e1s necesitados y as\u00ed mejorarles la calidad de vida a otras personas. \n","en":"Flor is someone who has always considered herself to be very hardworking and so, seeing that her husband's income was not sufficient to cover household costs, she decided to set up her own business and thus contribute financially to pay household costs. So she acquired a business that was available in the central park of her municipality and began working hard to get ahead. Her business is a bar where she also offers her customers games such as billiards and other games of chance. Thanks to her good customer service and good location she can make very good sales in her business and this allows her to have a good income for her household. Since her sales are increasing in her business but she doesn't have enough capital to make it grow, Flor is seeking a loan that would allow her to purchase drinks and other, additional products in order to stock her bar and offer her customers a good variety of items. \r\n\r\nIn this way she will have the chance to keep generating the income that her household needs to keep having a good quality of life, in addition to being able to continue offering her ten-year-old son access to a good-quality education. Her greatest dream is to keep on in her business since it has allowed to her to make considerable improvements to her life circumstances, and to generate employment in the future for those who are most needy, in order to improve the quality of life of others. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1106705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase drinks and other products in order to stock her bar and offer her customers a good variety of products. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caicedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:50Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T07:01:50Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142513},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146507},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150612},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154833},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159173},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163633},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168219},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172934},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177780},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182762},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187884},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":431781,"name":"Benkadi 5 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe Benkadi 5 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 36 ans, 4 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0  Moribila Nagousso, un des villages de San, 4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur quatri\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution tous les trois pr\u00eats pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s sans difficult\u00e9.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est : l\u2019arachide  avec    FATOUMATA,  2 eme assise avec une \u00e9charpe rose sur la t\u00eate sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, semence et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir : 1 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et au march\u00e9 de San, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e de revendeurs et de consommateurs. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 185.000FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes. \n","en":"The members of this Benkadi 5 group are married women with an average age of 36, four children, all living in traditional families in Moribila Nagousso, one of the villages of San, fourth administrative region of Mali.

Anteriormente viv\u00eda en otro sector de la ciudad, pero se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de trasladarse por problemas que hab\u00eda en el sector. Con mucho esfuerzo ha levantado su hogar y debido a que no tiene historial crediticio le ha tocado recurrir a pagadiarios, a quienes les prestaba dinero pagando el 20% de inter\u00e9s mensual. Roberto es muy conocido en el sector por tener un gran carisma. Gracias a que su tienda general es la \u00fanica en el sector le permite tener muy buenas ventas, por esto requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos de la canasta familiar que ya se encuentran agotados, adem\u00e1s de comprar una vitrina.\n\nDe esta manera Roberto espera poder iniciar con un historial crediticio que le permita tener en un futuro un mejor acceso a las entidades financieras, adem\u00e1s de poder tener su negocio bien surtido. Su mayor anhelo es tener un minimercado dado el potencial de clientes que hay en el sector, y as\u00ed generar m\u00e1s ingresos para su familia y tambi\u00e9n generar empleo para los m\u00e1s necesitados. \n","en":"Four months ago, Roberto started up a general store business in his town, taking advantage of his 12 years of experience selling food in the towns.  It was this food business that allowed him to save up the money to start up the store he has now.  Before, he lived in another neighborhood in the city, but he saw the need to move because of problems in that neighborhood.  It took a lot of effort for him to move to a new home, and since he didn't have a credit history he had to resort to the informal lenders, paying a monthly interest rate of 20 percent.  Roberto is very well-known in the neighborhood as he is quite charismatic.  Thanks to his general store, which is the only one in the neighborhood, he is able to have very good sales.  He needs a loan for this business so that he can buy consumer staples that he is out of, and he will also buy a glass display case.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Roberto hopes to start a credit history that will allow him better access in the future to financial entities.  Also, he will be able to keep his business well-stocked.  His main wish is to have a mini-market, given the potential with the customers that are in his neighborhood.  In this way he could generate more income for his family and also generate jobs for those in greatest need.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1106752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy consumer staples and a glass display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:51Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T07:01:51Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89348},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91849},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94421},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97065},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99783},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102577},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105449},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108401},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111437},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114557},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117765},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121062},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124452},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127936},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131519},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135201},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138987},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142878},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146879},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150991},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155219},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159565},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164033},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168626}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":432125,"name":"Facundo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Facundo tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 4 hijos, su esposa se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar, el es un hombre muy educado, amable y responsable.

She is 38 years old and married to Benito, who is a worker at a company which processes tuna and tuna products. They have 3 children, 2 boys and a girl, who attend secondary school and business school. Maricela tells us that she started as a helper in a restaurant where she earned 8 dollars a day, but her hours were only in the morning. This was convenient for her since she could care for her children, since they were young and she had nobody she could leave them with. In the afternoon she would go to the corner of her house with a small roaster and sold chicken wings, skewers, and ears of corn, collecting about 30 dollars a day. Little by little her business has been growing. Now she has a restaurant where she sells snacks to the employees leaving the company. She no longer works in the other restaurant. Maricela tells us that she opens only from Monday to Friday because she doesn't sell much on the weekend without workers. Currently she has a helper who works with her from 4 in the afternoon until 10 at night, which is when she sells the most. This is Maricela's 4th loan and for D-Miro it is a proud example of success. We have faith in her success because together we have seen her advance, from the beginning with a simple stand outside of her house to the restaurant that we have now. She asks us for another loan to adapt the business and to have money for the business. D-Miro says: Maricela, good luck, and meet all of your proposed goals, we are here to support

On the other hand, one of Elvin's advantages is that his property is located in a zone which is very suitable for the cultivation of coffee and therefore coffee production goes very well. \r\n\r\nElvin is requesting this loan because he needs to purchase fertilizer and pay his laborers to weed the land, giving him an appropriate and improved maintenance of the farming. With the help of this loan he will be able to maintain his farm well fertilized and clean. His goal is to continue planting in order to become a good coffee producer and keep the farm in good conditions. This will generate better earnings for him and allow him to help support his parents and child. Elvin has had three cycles of receiving support from FAMA with loans he has obtained and expects to invest the money well to make his payments on time. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1108342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for fertilizer and laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Trojes, El Paraiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:59Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T07:01:59Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvin Yobany","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gina Cappuccitti","image":null}},{"id":432742,"name":"Grupo Solidario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Clara esta casada, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 2 hijos los cuales aun no estudian, se dedica a la agricultura, a la siembra de papas tipo F.L., inicio este trabajo con peque\u00f1as porciones de siembre y en terreno prestado y hasta el momento lleva 8 a\u00f1os de experiencia, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo que se dedica al mismo trabajo y al comercio.\n\nOrganiza un grupo y solicitan un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de semillas y fertilizante para papas, en el futuro espera tener mas terreno y aumentar su producci\u00f3n de papas.

Melisa is very hard-working, business-minded, intelligent, and responsible. A few years ago, she decided to start her clothing business because she is a single mother, and it is the main source of income for her family. Every day she wakes up very early to do all of the household chores, take care of her family, and then attend to her business. Many people prefer her business because Melisa is a very friendly and responsible woman, but most importantly, her customers always find what they are looking for at the best prices. Her dream is to be able to build her inventory to increase sales, and in this way, be able to increase her income and better support her family.

Dolores lives in Libertad at the home of her parents since she is already separated from her spouse.  She has a son who attends a state school, which is why she manages two businesses.  Dolores says that she has always sold beauty products because she likes having income to cover her expenses, but it also gives her time to take care of her son.  Every day she visits with relatives and friends in the mornings and afternoons to offer them perfumes, cr\u00e8mes, lip pencils, and deodorants.  Despite the time that is required of her to generate needed income, Dolores says she decided to begin selling prepared foods because her family said that her cooking was delicious.  \n\nAt first Dolores only sold to people she knew, which resulted in few orders and very little profit.  A year ago, she decided to sell to the public and now has very good results.  At night she works alone selling snacks from a stand set up in front of her house.  Dolores says she operates her two businesses by herself, so her greatest worry is that a serious illness would paralyze both ventures and she would have no means of covering her expenses.  She hopes to avoid this problem and expects to secure her loan and cover all the required payments.  Dolores hopes to invest in products for her business, such as perfumes, makeup, deoderant, powder, etc. She will invest in this business because it is the most profitable and she can cover her expenses. Dolores' goal is to be able to purchase a glass case to display the items that she sells.

At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar (treasurer) is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf. Tejan is a head teacher at the school and leader of this group. Tejan is married to a small scale businesswoman and the couple has children attending primary and secondary schools. Tejan has been a teacher for 19 years now.
