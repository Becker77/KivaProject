","en":"Farogat works in trade - she sells candy, various sweets, chewing gum and spices at the local market. She started with a very small operation and has kept it running for the past 10 years.

","en":"Tukhta was born in an educated and intellectual family. She has worked with selling dry fruits, more precisely dried apricots, for many years. Currently her husband is immigrating to the Russian Federation, and therefore the burden of caring for the three children and the family economy lies on her shoulders. \r\n\r\nTukhta has already been buying and selling dried apricots for 12 years. At the start of every year she rents an apricot orchard with many trees. She dries and treats the apricots together with her children and sells them at a high price.

The profits gained from his business support his family's daily household expenses and school fees and allowances for his two children who go to school.\r\n\r\nAbdulmoin is married and blessed with five children. His greatest dream is to gain enough income to be able to support his two children in their studies. He knows that he could make all this possible through his dedication, enough capital and wise management of the business.

With more crops, Miguel hopes to increase his sales, which would be very helpful to him in supporting his household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1111337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds to plant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Amilcar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447405}],"funded_date":"2012-07-04T04:44:46Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:24:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":435155,"name":"Feda'a","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Feda'a is 43 years old married woman she lives in Al Khaledieh, Al Mafraq, Jordan.Feda'a is a conservative woman; she is unwilling to upload her photo on the internet.

Therefore, she is requesting a loan through INTEGRAL, in order to have the money she needs to buy more corn and be able to make more dough for the tortillas.  She will also buy tanks of propane gas.

She lives in the suburbs and transportation is a big part of her expenses. She also has high blood pressure. Her goal is to improve her house and to continue with her business, all while improving it by offering more choices and various garland designs that would bring in more customers. She has been with field partner FAMA for more than 6 years and has always been punctual in her repayments. Aracely sells fruit and vegetables in Juticalpa's central park.

Por esta raz\u00f3n Marisol solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a INTEGRAL, por medio del cual pueda comprar todos los insumos necesarios para la siembra como: abono, semilla de ma\u00edz y frijoles, con lo que podr\u00e1n cultivar mucho m\u00e1s de lo que han podido hasta ahora, permiti\u00e9ndoles percibir m\u00e1s ganancias.","en":"Marisol, age 47, has always been a person with a great desire to get ahead.  She has always put forth great effort to reach her goals.  She lives with her husband and children.  They completely devote themselves to agriculture.  They grow corn and beans for personal consumptions and to sell.\r\n\r\nMarisol is a very proud mother because her children are hard-working and tenacious people who want to improve the condition of her business.  That is why Marisol is requesting a loan from Integral.  With the loan she will be able to buy all of the supplies like fertilizer and corn and bean seeds that are needed for planting.  She will use them to cultivate much more than she has been able to do so far.  This will allow them to get more income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1113147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and corn and bean seeds to plant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-07-02T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-01T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":590,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":243.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":346.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":248.07,"local_amount":243.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":248.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399736498},{"amount":351.93,"local_amount":346.06,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":351.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579479166}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T13:14:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:40:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":437979,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay workers who are mulching his gardens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":163,"posted_date":"2012-07-02T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-01T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":235667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":248893.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294372473},{"amount":183.17,"local_amount":431001,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":455190.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308798754},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":176021.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315417168},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":166665,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-16T09:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":176019.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323215803}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T09:28:29Z","paid_date":"2012-12-16T09:50:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":437964,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is a forty five year old married woman with six children living in Kasese, Uganda.
