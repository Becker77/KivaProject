She is involved in selling children's clothing at the central market.  She has over four years of experience in this business.  This business is the primary source of income for her family.  Gulsara wants to save money to make sure that her children are not in need for anything and to provide them with a good education.

She makes a living selling tortillas, which she has done for fifteen years.  She has spent much time working in this business and it has given her very good experience.  Juana is proud that her business has been successful.  Her tortilla shop is located in her home and is well known in the area, since the tortillas she sells are the freshest and most delicious.  Juana has many customers who like to buy her tortillas because of their quality and affordable price, and because her service is the fastest.  She also raises cattle, which helps her cover the household expenses.  Juana is very dedicated to her work, and is always on the lookout for new opportunities that could help her achieve greater prosperity in the future.  The demand for Juana\u2019s tortillas has recently increased, and so she wants to increase her production.

It also offers a variety of places where people can escape the routine of the city. Its lands are fertile, and for this reason its people work in farming, animal raising and trade. They still maintain the culture and traditions of their peoples. \r\n\r\nJulia is 63 years old. She is divorced, and from her marriage she has 3 children who are all adults, married and living independently. She owns the house where she lives. \r\n\r\nJulia dedicates herself to her household tasks, and to cover her economic needs, she raises and sells animals such as chickens and pigs. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the communal bank for 10 years, and she will invest her new loan in buying chickens and pigs, as well as feed for these animals. \r\n \r\nHer goal is to have a store again; she previously had one but had to close it because she didn't have time to run it.

They work in shellfish sales and tell us that on weekends they travel to Pedernales in her father's car to buy all kinds of shellfish in this place and later bring them to deliver in Guayaquil, Portoviejo and other places where they deliver them to retailers.  They have spent around a year in this business, but it's going very well for them, since each time they have more clients to supply with their shellfish.

This is his story: I began working for the Diocese of Lweru in 2012 as Development Officer and have recently had the opportunity to begin a solar lighting retail business, working with my colleague from Switzerland, Daeni (on the left in the picture). This is an exciting new project where I can use my previous development project experience to build up the business. The current electricity supply does not reach every part of the country; this is especially true for rural areas. Solar lights prevent people from using kerosene lights, which are dangerous and very unhealthy. The main impacts of using solar lighting are that people save money by not using kerosene, charging their phones, and keeping their shops open in the evening; students and pupils are able to study more in the evening; and people reduce damage to their lungs and reduce the risk of burning themselves and their houses. The distribution of Barefoot Power products will benefit the community and Tanzanians as a whole by giving a reliable and sustainable source of light and, by providing this light source, helping to fight the three national enemies, which are limited education, disease, and poverty. We plan to distribute Barefoot Power products to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses who want to sell them in villages and also train new staff and provide employment locally as the business grows.\n\nWatu na Nuru, which means \u201cLight for the People\u201d in Swahili, is the name of a growing collection of businesses established with the support of the Anglican Church of Tanzania, with the aim of making high-quality, affordable solar lighting kits available to rural communities. Watu na Nuru needs to have sufficient quantities of the right products at the best time of year, which in this area is when the coffee harvest is in. We have developed a partnership with Barefoot Power Australia, who make what we believe are the best micro-solar systems on the market. When we are not selling product, we will provide training and technical support to retailers and micro-entrepreneurs because we want to ensure that these lights continue working for years. My greatest challenge in this role is ensuring that the products are available at the right time of year. Your loan will support our stock so that more village entrepreneurs can sell these lighting solutions. My favourite part of the job is to advertise and teach how to use solar lamps."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10075,"image":{"id":1130441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy stock of micro-solar lighting kits from Barefoot Power.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Muleba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T11:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T11:00:06Z","loan_amount":10075,"lender_count":306,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gration","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":15800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":10075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4800000},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3060.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7014.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3060.76,"local_amount":4800000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T08:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4806922.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381633359},{"amount":7014.24,"local_amount":11000000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T08:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11015864.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467832452}],"funded_date":"2012-07-05T12:36:35Z","paid_date":"2014-04-18T08:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":440123,"name":"Yayah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yawah, 31, is married with four children and they all live in compound #3.

He is an honorable and honest man. He lives with his family in their own home. He learned how to plant corn, beans and other basic crops when he was little. That is why now he grows corn and sorghum. He has always done his job well in the best way so that there is never a lack of food in his house, and even more so his children will never lack for anything. Abner has had complications with previous crops because of heavy rains and pests that haven't allowed his crops to bear fruit. That is why he has gone to INTEGRAL to ask for a loan.

the city of Melitopol.  She sells women's shoes at a local market.  She owns her retail outlet.  She has 17 years of experience in this work.  Yelena, much like other market entrepreneurs in the Ukraine, often comes across the problem of the changing dollar currency rate and reductions in sales.

She sells \u2018rosquillas\u2019 [cookies] and quesadillas.\r\n\r\nSandra learned to make rosquillas and quesadillas over 30 years ago and started working with a neighbor who worked in this activity.  Her products are preferred by Juticalpa residents and also by people living abroad since most of her product is purchased to be shipped to relatives or friends living in the United States.  She works with her youngest son and her work day starts at 4am which is very demanding.  However, once the product is out of the oven she can rest while her son takes care of customers.\r\n\r\nThe loan Sandra is requesting is needed to buy milk, corn, sugar, firewood and eggs among other products to make rosquillas and quesadillas.  With support from the loan, Sandra will be able to fill some pending orders she has which will generate profits to cover some household expense like rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":880640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, corn, sugar, firewood and eggs among other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2064.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551469},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377739},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387881},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372398},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981331},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2064.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331965053},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-26T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340349331},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-27T08:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3096.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347061906}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T00:43:59Z","paid_date":"2013-03-27T08:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":440582,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is an 18-year-old man from Sahab, Jorda.

She plans to invest the loan in the amount of 21 000 hryvnia into repairing and remodeling her new retail counter and purchasing winter merchandise at a low purchase price.  Wholesale markets often have more affordable prices for next season shoes for sellers-entrepreneurs, if the merchandise is ordered in advance.  Irina has always been pragmatic and able to balance her finances well.

A network is when there is one main person who manages the orders, deliveries and payment.  They earn money for every member they have in their network.  G\u00e9nesis currently has 30 people in her network which makes her a lot of profits.  It also has the advantage that she has very little contact with the end customer which reduces her risk of having to deal with people who don't pay.  G\u00e9nesis tells us that she doesn't work fixed hours as she is available whenever people make orders so that she doesn't let her saleswomen down.  She also sells perfumes, creams and makeup to family members and acquaintances to order.  She will use her loan to buy products to have in stock.

Quiterio is married to Yisela who works for a fish processing plant; they have two children who are 6 years old and 1 year old.  \r\n\r\nHe works in production in that he processes Tagua [vegetable ivory] pits.  He started out motivated by a neighbor who also works in this activity and did well.  He taught him the business and told him that success depended on the volume he could handle.  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning he had his doubts because it was something new for him but gradually he gained more confidence and customers.  He\u2019s been in business six years and it\u2019s been growing step by step.  He recalls that at first he did not have the tools to handle the Tagua pits but he now has machines that make the process easier.  The process consists in collecting, peeling, shaping and drying.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiterio sells at wholesale and retail. In the photo sacks of material appear that will be used to convert the pits into buttons and artisanal animal figurines.  Because this business is his source of income he works at it only from 7am until 5pm.  Most of his customers are small vendors in the city who sell the products as souvenirs to tourists at the beaches in Manta.  His greatest obstacle is during the winter because streets around his business are unpaved and product delivery is difficult.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he\u2019s requesting, Quiterio will increase production with the purchase of tagua pits for production hoping to gather the necessary capital to buy an additional machine.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1116930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"

Initially, the business belonged to his sister, who had a well-known workshop frequented by a great number of customers. It was she who first taught him the ropes of the business; later he decided to take some courses to learn about sewing techniques. He discovered that he quite enjoyed sewing, so he decided to expand his sister's workshop. This is the second loan that he has applied for; the first loan was invested in buying a sewing machine.

An advantage he has is that when the weather is favourable, the crops grow well. Heriberto asks for a loan because he needs the money to buy manure, urea, and chemical fertilisers, and to hire help. The problems he faces have to do with watering the crops (sometimes there is too much water, which is harmful, and sometimes there is not enough water), fighting parasites, and, when the times come to sell the produce, the risk of a drop in prices. His goal is to make his crops grow and to have a harvest in good condition for selling.

widow. She's raised two children and is now caring for her thirteen-year-old nephew. In 1996, searching for a new source of income, she began a farming and animal raising business from a starting capital of 15,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to her hard work and dedication, her business has grown to include 6 cows with offspring, 10 heads of small-horned cattle, 2 horses, 3 hectares of land she uses to grow potatoes and grain crops on and a monthly income of 7,500 soms (KGS) by selling milk. \r\n\r\nHoping to expand to her business even further, Jumagul approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan of 70,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase some small-horned cattle. She plans to reinvest the profits from the loan back into her business.

He remembers how beautiful his hometown was because of the variety of fruits that are grown.  He has lived in Quevedo for more than 15 years because his parents migrated in search of a better future for their children.  Now he is 26 years old and is still in Quevedo.  He has his own family and fights every day for them.  He is married to Elsa, a housewife who works taking care of their children, ages 2 years and 4 months.\r\n\r\nEduardo has worked buying and selling junk since he lost his job.  When his contract ended he received a settlement, with which he bought a three-wheeled motorcycle and began his job.  He decided on this job because an uncle told him it was profitable and taught him the job.  He works from 7 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon, covering various areas.

su hijo ya que es madre soltera. La casa que alquila es de cemento y cuenta con los servicios de agua, luz y camino pavimentado. Su hijo tiene 15 a\u00f1os y estudia en el colegio fiscal del Quevedo. Cruz se dedica a la costura desde los 26 a\u00f1os cuando se gradu\u00f3 de la academia. La actividad la inicio con una maquina domestica que compro en una casa comercial con financiamiento, como deb\u00eda pagar las cuotas empez\u00f3 a ofrecer sus servicios. Al principio sus clientes eran familiares y amigos pero poco a poco fue mejorando ya que ellos le hac\u00edan publicidad. Hace 2 a\u00f1os cambio su domicilio ya que necesitaba algo m\u00e1s amplio para colocar sus maquinas ya que cuenta con 2 maquinas de coser, una overlock y mesas para cortar. Por ese motivo adecuo la sala de casa para poner el taller ya que tiene un ayudante y necesita espacio. Trabaja de lunes a s\u00e1bado todo el d\u00eda y cuando tiene trabajo que entregar descansa cuando lo termina ya que le gusta ser puntual. Confecciona en su mayor\u00eda vestido de fiesta, ternos, uniformes y realiza arreglos de prendas si se lo solicitan. Cruz est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de una recubridora y cortadora para agilizar su trabajo. Su sue\u00f1o es tener un local donde abrir el taller para brindar un mejor servicio.","en":"Cruz is 49-years-old and rents a house in the city of Quevedo where she lives with her son, as she is a single mother.  The house she rents is made of cement and has electricity and running water, as well as paved roads accessing it.  Her son is 15-years-old and studies in the accounting school of Quevedo.  Cruz has worked as a seamstress since she was 26-years-old, when she graduated from the academy.  She began with a personal sewing machine that she bought from a shopping center on credit, and to make the payments she began to offer her services as a seamstress.  In the beginning, her customers were relatives and friends, but little by little business improved as they spread the word.  Two years ago, she changed houses as she needed a larger place to fit her machines as now she has two sewing machines, an overlock machine, and cutting tables.  With this in mind, she uses the living room of the house for her workshop as now she has a helper and needs the space.  She works Monday through Saturday, all day, and when she has an order to complete, she only rests when she is done because she likes to be punctual.  She mostly makes party dresses, suits, and uniforms; as well as doing repairs on garments if that is asked of her.  Cruz is requesting the loan to buy upholstery sewing machine and a cutting machine to speed up her work.  Her dream is to have a shop where she can open her workshop so she can offer better

She married very young and already has a three-year-old boy whom she takes care of. He does not yet attend school.  Her husband has a barbershop, in which she assists him.  After she got married, she began to enjoy the business and has been working with the aim of meeting her daily expenses.  She has always been an enterprising woman, and she now sells beauty products.\r\n\r\nHer biggest selling items are perfumes, whether they are from Ecuador or other countries.  She obtains the foreign perfumes through a friend who has an export business.  She works all day without rest from 7 in the morning until 9 at night, making her rounds promoting her products or collecting payment from her customers.\r\n\r\nMaria reports that this season has been more difficult since the rains have damaged the streets where she sells her products.  The loan she is seeking is to renovate her husband's barbershop to make space for her to sell her own products there.  The funds will be used to buy glass, cement, sand and stones for the construction.  Her dream for the future is to be able to buy her own home where she can live
