Four years ago, she bought a house with help from her husband. Juan is Gloria's husband; he's a master builder and has been in this line of work for 12 years. They have three children who go to public school. Gloria's business is pottery, that is to say, she makes ceramic figures to serve as ornaments or souvenirs. She started this business because of a course she took out of curiosity - she enjoyed it a lot and realized that she was skilled at painting. She began by buying the piece and painting it her own way, with guidance from the magazines she got from the lessons she took. In her business, she needs to be open to criticism and know how to take it into account, because customers are not all alike. Currently, she's experienced in this line of work, especially in creating the pieces. There's a process for that: first comes the creation of the piece, made out of kaolin, clay, ashes, powdered silica and lime, which are mixed proportionately to form a paste that's poured into a mold. Secondly, there's the drying in open air, when the piece acquires a more solid consistency that can be manipulated for finishing. Thirdly, the piece is placed in special ovens where it's cooked, and attention is paid so that it doesn't suffer a sudden change in temperature, which could cause it to crack. Then it's left for cooling and painted at will. Certain pieces such as the souvenirs are painted before going into the oven - they demand more delicate handling, but the result is a very eye-catching, beautiful product.

Together they have four children, but three of them are adults and only the youngest one lives with them. She runs a grocery store from her home where she sells essential household goods. The business started 19 years ago, when she separated from her husband and, since she didn't work, she needed money to support her children. She started out small, but little by little she began saving up money and expanding the store. She also sells fast food which is very well-received. In the beginning there were complications in both businesses, because she wasn't familiar with them, but gradually she learned and now she's an excellent businesswoman. Thank God she saw the results from her efforts, since she got back together with her husband and she keeps her business afloat.

His hopes for the future are to continue as a united family and to keep on working without problems.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1118874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy colas, water, groceries, sugar, and rice to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Milagro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-04T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-03T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.24,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":438724,"name":"De Los Angeles Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Los \u00c1ngeles lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Jaqueline de 26 a\u00f1os quien inicio hace cinco a\u00f1os con el comercio de ropa y cosm\u00e9ticos con las ganancias hace 2 a\u00f1os que instalo una peque\u00f1a pulper\u00eda negocio en que invertir\u00e1 el cr\u00e9dito.

Two of her children have settled for marriage while her other three children are already working.\r\n\r\nMercedes has been involved in a beauty salon business for 20 years. She does not have a fixed stall location where she could have all the equipment needed to provide her services due to the insufficient capital she has. At her age, she aims to have a fixed location for her beauty salon, so that she will no longer perform her services on a house-to-house basis. For this reason, she is asking for a loan of PHP 30,000 allowing her to buy rebonding chemicals, nail cuticle products and nail polish for her beauty salon business. She believes that this loan will help her to obtain greater profits, which will enable her to provide quality service to customers and be able to cover all her household expenses and have a better way

Vive en el sector norte conocido como Basti\u00f3n Popular donde tiene su domicilio propio de cemento y cuenta con los servicios b\u00e1sicos. Hace 11 a\u00f1os inicio su taller de confecci\u00f3n de ropa. Aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven porque su mama se dedicaba a este negocio y fue ella quien le ense\u00f1o corte. Se desempe\u00f1o como su ayudante por varios a\u00f1os aprendiendo no solo la confecci\u00f3n de las prendas sino tambi\u00e9n el trato a los clientes y proveedores. Pasando varios a\u00f1os se independizo al formar su familia empezando a ofrecer sus servicios con una maquina casera de coser. Poco  a poco se fue dando a conocer y ampliar el negocio realizando varios cr\u00e9ditos para poder crecer. Actualmente tiene varias maquinas industriales y realiza confecciones por series, los pedidos se los hacen empresas y consisten en camisas tipo polo bordadas con el logotipo de la misma, pantalones unisex y chalecos este tipo de ropa es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de confeccionar porque se realiza con medidas est\u00e1ndar. Trabaja de lunes a domingo cuando es necesario desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde. Mantiene un horario de trabajo porque tiene un grupo de personas que laboran para \u00e9l. Se siente satisfecho ya que en estos a\u00f1os ha visto el crecimiento de su negocio hasta el punto de poder brindar trabajo a personas que lo necesitan. El mayor problema de Alfredo es enfermarse ya que el conoce todo su negocio y no tendr\u00eda quien lo reemplace pero tiene fe en Dios que le brindara salud y fuerza necesaria para continuar. El pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando lo empleara en la compra de mercader\u00eda como telas, hilos, botones y dinero para realizar reparaciones a sus maquinas. ","en":"Alfredo lives in Orqu\u00eddeas, where he has a tailoring workshop. At the age of 49, he is a widower and his children are grown. He lives in the northern sector known as Basti\u00f3n Popular, where he has his own home made of cement, with basic utility services. He started his tailoring workshop 11 years ago. He learned the trade when he was very young, because his mother worked in this business, and it was she who taught him to make clothing. He worked as her assistant for a number of years, learning not only how to make clothing but also how to deal with customers and suppliers. After some years went by, he set up on his own when he started a family, starting by offering his services with a home sewing machine. Little by little, he became known in the area and expanded his business, taking out several loans so that he could grow. Currently, he has several industrial machines, and he has lines of clothing that he creates. His orders come from companies, consisting of polo shirts embroidered with the firm's logo, unisex trousers and vests. This type of clothing is easier to make, because it is created with standard measurements. He works from Monday through Sunday, when necessary, from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening. He maintains fixed working hours because he has a group of people who work for him. He feels satisfied because in these years he has seen his business grow to the point of providing jobs for people who need them. Alfredo's greatest problem is getting ill, because he knows everything about his business and does not have someone to replace him. However, he says he has faith in God who will provide him with health and the strength he needs to continue. He will use the loan he is requesting to buy supplies such as fabrics, thread and buttons, and he will also use some of the funds to carry out repairs to his machines.

He has a general store that he started 17 years ago, when he first came to live in this place.  At first, his business consisted of the sale of rice and chicken, through which he was gaining customers, so he started to stock his business with a variety of products.  As he had made a big investment, he dedicated himself to the business so he could see it grow.  Now his store is well-stocked and has a big customer base.

Then she utilizes a cleaning machine whose tank is filled with water and carpet shampoo. The machine has rotating brushes at the base which when agitated, make the shampoo penetrate the fibers, washing out the dirt. She continues this until the water in the tank is no longer dirty.\r\n\r\nRocio says prices for cleaning vary according to carpet size but generally, she collects $10.00, and for upholstery $15.00.

In the photo he is observed near a cacao plant.  The reddish color of the fruit indicates that it is mature and that he can continue the drying process for selling.  The most difficult season is the winter since the rains flood certain parts of his farm and for this reason production lowers.\r\n\r\nVictor is separated from his wife, with whom he has 2 children.

Currently she has a business distributing eggs through her store, work she has been doing for several years, having learned it in a previous job. \r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her capital (buying eggs at wholesale) which she will purchase in the city of Cochabamba and later sell in her store. \r\n\r\nThis form of work helps her family move forward, as she is in a common-law relationship and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked her what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the health training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1122861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy eggs at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-04T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-03T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardina Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanneth\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliza\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23232.32,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3318.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":957.18,"local_amount":6638.04,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6661.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495262},{"amount":478.58,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260806},{"amount":478.59,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490516},{"amount":478.59,"local_amount":3319.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095375},{"amount":957.06,"local_amount":6637.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6661.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235456}],"funded_date":"2012-08-03T00:59:55Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":442485,"name":"Gerardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerardo 58, has been engaged in the farming business for over 25 years.

Juntos viven en la casa que le prest\u00f3 su t\u00edo, pues \u00e9l est\u00e1 fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\nSu actividad es la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de muebles de madera. Para eso alquila un taller para cortar la madera y armar los muebles, pero parte del acabado lo realiza en su casa, donde le da los toques finales como lijados y laqueados.

Pero para aumentar sus ingresos, su pareja, en sus ratos libres, se dedica al transporte de pasajeros en motocarro. Considera que su negocio es bastante rentable por las ganancias que le deja, con las cuales puede pagar los gastos del hogar, y brindar una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos. Antes de iniciar con este negocio le era dif\u00edcil solventar los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Sus planes a futuro son de ampliar su negocio e instalar su propio taller en casa.\n\nEste es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con la instituci\u00f3n MFP, por tanto cuenta con este financiamiento para cumplir con sus objetivos. Se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, para tener un buen record crediticio.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 3000 nuevos soles, invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n y el acabado de sus muebles; como madera, thinner, laca y un cortador de madera manual valorizado en 380 nuevos soles.","en":"Mar\u00eda, 37, is a woman with much business experience in addition to being cheerful and kind.  Her partner is Jair who is a merchant and the father of their three children: Clara, 18, Tarsis, 11 and Wini, 10.  They live together in a house their uncle lent them since he\u2019s abroad.\r\n\r\nHer activity is manufacturing and selling wood furniture.  To do so she leases a workshop to cut the lumber and assemble the furniture but she does some of the finishing touches like sanding and lacquering at home.  She started out with a wood cutting machine she bought with her savings and she\u2019s been in business for over a year now with support from her partner who works providing passenger transportation services with a car.  She deems that her business is quite profitable because of the profits it produces that she can use to pay household expenses and to provide a good education for her children.  Before starting this business it was difficult to cover all household and educational expenses.  Her plan for the future is to expand the business and set up her own workshop at home.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP so she now has support from this loan to reach her goals.  She commits to make her installment payments in order to establish a good credit history.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 3000 new soles to buy supplies needed to manufacture the furniture like lumber, lacquer and a handsaw valued at 380 new soles.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1122917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

He is farmer who has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 30 years. During those years Heydar gained enough skills and experience to run this business, profitable because fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. <p>\r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy, and many national dishes are made of vegetables including pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are on every table in the average Azerbaijan family, and Heydar usually sells his crop in the central bazaar.

Luego de preparar la tierra se tira la semilla para que empiece la siembra y posterior a esto la cosecha.

He also knows how to drill and clean wells since this is how water is provided in the countryside. \r\n\r\nHe makes a living planting cucumber and corn which he sells in the Milagros plaza. He begins his day at 5 in the morning and works until 5 in the evening because he must take advantage of the sunlight the best he can in the countryside. When he reaps a harvest he must first prepare the land. As we see in the photo, the land is plowed. The plowing is done with animals or machines. After preparing the land he plants the seeds so they begin to grow and after that is the harvest. His greatest difficulty is climatic change, above all the winter season because of the floods. \r\n\r\nHis wife and children help him when they are not in school. The loan that Carlos requests is to buy seeds, fertilizer and a spray pump.

He describes his biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the business. He will use the KES 45,000 loan to buy more meat for resale.

They all live together in his own home along with his sister-in-law. \r\n\r\nHis business is the selling and distributing of groceries.  For this business, he conditioned a space in his home where he stores his products.  He distributes them to the grocery stores in remote communities and zones.  He learned this skill by working as a salesman in a company, but he left because of the low pay they gave him. He decided to start his own business over a year ago.  During this time he was able to grow and have many customers with the support of his partner who looked after the small store they also had in the house.

This is 26-year-old Isata from Kulanda town in the southern area of Sierra Leone. She is married with two children, ages five and seven years. One of her children attends school. Isata began her business, because she did not go to school, so her parents taught her about business. \r\n\r\nIsata runs a local food stand in a busy market area. She sells Maggie cubes, onions, tomato paste and oil. She has been running this business for ten years. She works at the business from 7:00 am until 7:30 pm, seven days per week. Her business is the only source of income she has. At present, she faces two challenges during the rainy season: low purchasing power and the business becoming wet and spoilt.\r\n\r\nIsata has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking seasonings such as Maggie cubes, onions, tomato paste and oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to renovate the roof of her house. In the future, she wants to expand her business with a huge amount of product so that she would be able to take care of her family. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1128755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 40-year-old Fatmata from Kandeh town in Bo southern area, Sierra Leone. She is married with two children between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Her children attend school. \r\n\r\nFatmata runs a clothing and textiles shop; she sells zippers, thread, needles, buttons, and scissors. She has been running this business for 12 years. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. Her other source of income comes from her elder brother. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more textiles such as zippers, thread, needles, buttons, and scissors. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and educate her children. In the future, she plans to build a house on her own. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1128873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married with 2 children ages 6 years and 10 years. She has four children that are currently attending school; two are relatives of hers. In 2002, Bintu established her table business that sells palm oil, fish, Maggi and rice. She began her business because at 17 years she left school and got married. Her husband is a driver but his income is not enough to support her. She started to run a small-scale trading business to increase the income in the home. She wakes up at 5:30 am to go to the next village to buy goods and sell them on her table. She will not rest until 7:30 pm. She says that the main challenge to her business is there is no vehicle to enter the village where she usually buys goods.\r\n\r\nBintu requires a loan in order to buy more food commodities like palm oil, fish, Maggi and rice. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and expand her business. In the future, Bintu plans to establish her business in Bo town. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1128734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is widowed with 3 children between the ages of 11 years and 19 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 2000, Manneth established her general merchandise business. She began her business because she did not go to school and started up her business so she will have a source of income to support her family. She works at the business 10 hours a day and 7 days per week.

She then bought a sewing machine with her savings and she began investing more with the loans from MFP.  She currently has four sewing machines which she has in her home where she also attends to her customers.  She has succeeded in being preferred by and recommended by many people.  She began her business over 10 years ago and so far has been doing it on her own.  She likes what she does because she can help her partner in covering the household expenses.

For the past 4 years, Grace has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food like matooke. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke for resale, and will help Grace to generate greater profits and take care of herself. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house.\r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Grace's future prospects by helping her to improved her

Teddy is 21 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past year, Teddy has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food like sweet potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teddy has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh foods like sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Teddy to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Teddy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build on it. \r\n\r\nTeddy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Teddy's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Florence is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past three years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fish for resale, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. Florence hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a car and build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save her money.
