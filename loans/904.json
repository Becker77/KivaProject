who does retail farming in the Wakiso district. He is married with five children.\r\n\r\nHe decided to go into farming because there is market from the town dwellers who depend on market food. He also had no formal education to help him find a job, nor did he have capital to begin business.\r\n\r\nHe apparently hires the land on which he does the farming and his dream is to buy his own piece of land to maximize profits. He believs he will be able to purchase the land from the profits and the loan.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge is the unpredictable weather conditions which affect the crops in case of heavy rains or severe sun shine in addition to fluctuating market prices. \r\n\r\nCharles is a very hard working and shrewd man.

Two years ago she started selling tortillas as part of her business but, owing to the time it took to make the tortillas, she wasn't able to both make the tortillas and sell her food.  As a result, she invited Dora, who she had known for a number of years, to support her in the tortilla business.  This has worked out pretty well for her everyday customers.  The two women currently plan to improve the premises that they share for their businesses.  They would like to include tables for the customers who want to eat their food on the premises.

He is a vendor by trade, specializing in selling scrap metal and used plastic. Facing a cash shortage, he does not always manage to have sufficient stock in order to even meet existing demand. Dodji has been working in this field for 2010. He is seeking a loan from WAGES in order to replenish his stock. He hopes to have a storage facility one day, and later on a big store. He would like to increase his sale points and be able to pay for his children\u2019s education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1133618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy scrap metal and used plastic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Akodessewa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kouami","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23004},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23349},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23699},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24055},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24416},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24782},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25154},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25531},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25914},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26303},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26697},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27096}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.12,"local_amount":25560,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26624.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294469606},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":46250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":48176.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308696064},{"amount":26,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13541.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315520556},{"amount":67.92,"local_amount":33960,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35374.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323761253},{"amount":121.9,"local_amount":60950,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-26T09:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63488.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339644754},{"amount":32,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":16666.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347200862},{"amount":50.88,"local_amount":25440,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":26499.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356597151},{"amount":157.68,"local_amount":78840,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82124.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373050110}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T20:26:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":443753,"name":"Asif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asif is a 35-year-old man who lives in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and two daughters.

He suffered an accident in which he lost his vision.  Recently they moved to their own home, and in the residential area began to sell eggs and sausages that she wishes to supplement with other products, proving herself to also be a person with vision for the business.

She sells from her home, which has generated a good income.  The purpose of the loan is to provide working capital in order to offer other products. \r\n      The income generated from the business of selling from a catalog allows her to cover the payments of the requested loan.  In addition to investing in merchandise she is going to offer a greater variety of products from her home, with the goal of creating a food store in the residential area where she lives because the closest supermarket is about 1 kilometer away.\r\n      The borrower has had about six months of having moved to her own home, in a neighborhood of San Juan de Poas near Volc\u00e1n Poas, where little services are offered.  She has sold her products by catalog in the area, but she sees greater potential in the sale of groceries and other things.  With the capital from her work she began to offer eggs and sausages about 4 months ago, and the sales have increased.  Putting in a glass case with other merchandise (part of the investment carried out) will allow her to grow and in the future construct a supermarket on her property, which has enough space to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1123969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"sell by catalog and also distribute products from her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Juan de Poas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22790.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23170.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23556.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23949.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24348.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24754.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25167.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25586.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26013.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26446.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26887.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27327.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.75,"local_amount":45961.71,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-18T08:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":47690.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294893672},{"amount":49.08,"local_amount":23557,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24442.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301396858},{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":23949.58,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":24850.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308405542},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":24348.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25264.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614272},{"amount":51.57,"local_amount":24754.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25685.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322995708},{"amount":52.43,"local_amount":25167.12,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":26113.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331974657},{"amount":53.31,"local_amount":25586.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26548.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339521102},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":26017.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":26995.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356499287},{"amount":111.12,"local_amount":53362.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55369.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373135942},{"amount":56.93,"local_amount":27295.27,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":28321.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381941095}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T07:21:41Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:08:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":443766,"name":"Abdulkareem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdulkareem is 34 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nAbdulkareem has two jobs.

The members work in a number of different business activities including general commerce, food sales, services, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is where we get to know M\u00f3nica.  M\u00f3nica is 44 years old, married, and has three children who are all adults.  Her youngest daughter is studying at university and still lives at home.  Her husband works for a company in the city.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn her own money so that she can make progress together with her family, our friend works selling all kinds of clothing.  She makes her sales door to door and her daughter also helps her, selling to her fellow students at university.  She tells us that her customers place orders with her because she receives very good merchandise from a daughter who lives in Quito.  M\u00f3nica works three days a week making her sales and collecting payment.  She sells to her customers on credit and then collects payment every two weeks.  She has been in this business for one year and is doing very well.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica will use this loan to buy more merchandise such as: pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing.  This is her first loan cycle as a member of her community bank.  She is the president of her group and likes it because of the speed with which loans are disbursed.  Her dreams are to make progress in her business and to see her daughter become a professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5300,"image":{"id":1123002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":5300,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Annabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Belen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":662.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":662.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":1325,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335698},{"amount":1325,"local_amount":1325,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391477},{"amount":1325,"local_amount":1325,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150376},{"amount":1325,"local_amount":1325,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383484}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T23:15:53Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":443846,"name":"Sokhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokhan is 28 years old and lives in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia.

married and has one child. She says she has had a small store in her house for two years, and this is the second time she is requesting a loan. She needs it in order to increase inventory in her store, since she needs many products, and going out to make the purchases is very tiring and far away. In addition, products run out rather quickly, so she needs to go make purchases twice a week, since she needs to stock other products she doesn't have yet (fruits and vegetables). She would like to start selling these products, because her customers are asking for them constantly.\r\nShe hopes to receive the support she needs so that she can continue with her business.

Local people--many of whom make their living from the sea--work hard.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group formed the community bank some 4 months ago and they tell us that it has been a great help to their businesses.  The members operate a variety of businesses: general retail; food sales; and service businesses, for example. \r\n\r\nOur member, Don Francisco, 51, is partnered and has a 4-month old son.  His wife is a homemaker.  \r\n\r\nDon Francisco operates a mototaxi business.  He tells us that mototaxis are an important means of transportation here and widely used by both local people and tourists.  Local people use mototaxis because they're the most common way to get around and tourists use them to see local sights.  Don Francisco says that he especially likes showing tourists around, not only for the fares but also because they're generous tippers.

She leases a cafe, where she works as a cook and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, has been involved in animal husbandry since 1995, having started this business with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today Gulbakhor's business contains one dairy cow and four sheep, which have been moved to a mountain pasture to save money on livestock feed.  The profit from the sales of milk and earnings from the cafe yield 10,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Gulbakhor requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a dairy cow and small livestock for fattening up.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of livestock

She is a very determined, kind and hard-working woman.  She has three adult children with whom she lives, alongside her grandchildren.  She lives in her own home which she was able to build as a result of her hard work.\r\n\r\nLidia's business is making clothing.  She makes garments to order but also makes other items that she designs herself.  She has been in this business for more than 15 years but unfortunately, after many years of work, she had to take a few months rest owing to a health problem.  However, she re-started her work a year ago and now she is working even more keenly than before because this is her passion and she feels very happy when she sees her inspiration turn into a beautiful item of clothing.  She feels calm because she knows that her work allows her to make her own income and she does not have to depend on her children's money.  What Lidia likes about her work is that she is able to capture in a garment the design which inspired her.  The ease with which she creates new garments makes her one of the best dressmakers in the city.  She always feels useful.  However, she says that she doesn't really like making men's pants (trousers) because of the time and difficulty that it involves.

Her husband of 37 years is Ernesto, 61, with whom she has six children. The youngest is a minor who is still in school and dependent on his parents.\r\n\r\nHer main occupation is selling foodstuffs for daily consumption such as vegetables, fruits, eggs, and some groceries. Every day she places a table on the sidewalk in front of her house to sell her merchandise, which she buys wholesale in the city, selecting the freshest vegetables for her customers. Usually she works alone, but sometimes her son helps out when she has other household tasks to do. She has been doing this activity for about 5 years and likes the ease and convenience of generating income from her own home. For 14 years, she has also sold wholesale fish, though only during certain seasons. She belongs to a group of vendors who export the best fish from the city's rivers. She really loves what she does because her income helps her husband pay the household expenses. In the future, she hopes to set up a bodega where she can offer more items for sale.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with MFP, and she is grateful for the opportunity offered and the confidence invested in her. She promises to make her monthly payments responsibly and on time. She is also happy to be part of her communal bank because she has seen that the members are caring and courteous. She will use the requested loan (S\/. 500) to buy larger quantities of foodstuffs to sell and begin stocking her stand.

She has had this business for 3 years and it has permitted her to provide for everything necessary for the care of her children and their studies.  At first it was complicated for her because she didn\u2019t have a place to keep her drinks cold but fortunately she was able to buy her own freezer and overcome this hitch.  Now everything is going well and her plans to grow continue.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, therefore she is very grateful to those who are making it possible.

She has been in a relationship with Jes\u00fas for the past seven years. With him she has a 6 year old child whom she loves with all of her heart. She currently lives with her family in her parents house and together they make the effort to get ahead. \r\n\r\nHer work is making artisan cigars which are commonly called \"mapachos\". These cigars are made using the raw material of tobacco which is obtained from a traditional method in solid bars or compact bands. She purchases this material from stores in the city or from people who sell it during certain seasons. For this reason when she finds the material she has to buy it in large quantities to be supplied. To make the cigars she manually cuts the tobacco into small strands and then places them in papers, she finally rolls them and groups them in tens. She then sells them wholesale in small packets. She has worked in this business everyday for the past three years when she began to have the support and collaboration of her mother. She likes this work a lot because it generates the necessary revenue in order to handle the family expenses. However, she recognizes that in the beginning it was not easy for her because she did not have clients. Thanks to her friends' recommendations she was able to acquire customers who buy from her and now it is going very well for her. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is very content to know that she has financial support because with it she will feel more sure of advancing with her work. Also, she is committed to complying with on time payments of her loan. She is also very happy to belong to a communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nThe amount requested (500 soles) will be invested in the purchase of tobacco in order to maintain a supply of this raw material. \r\nEl monto solicitado (S\/. 500) lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de tabaco para mantenerse abastecida de su materia prima."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1124399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy tobacco to make the cigars that she sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":79.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":88.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.15,"local_amount":72.88,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":76.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402016},{"amount":31.91,"local_amount":79.76,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456291},{"amount":66.32,"local_amount":165.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":174.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447129},{"amount":35.24,"local_amount":88.11,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":92.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053033},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":93.45,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":98.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187962}],"funded_date":"2012-07-06T19:38:37Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gina Cappuccitti","image":null}},{"id":434354,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia is from the village of Marannao.

Her children help her economically since they all work and put everything they can into improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe does several jobs according to the season.  She sells bananas and on other occasions, fish.  However, her main activity is selling soft-drinks, beer and gelatin desserts at home.  Since she started this activity approximately two years ago she\u2019s worked alone and has been excited to watch how she\u2019s grown to become her customers\u2019 favorite store.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to have her own stand to sell food items and also wants to build her own beverage distribution center where she can sell all day more comfortably and quickly.  Although she\u2019s attained experience in this line of work she feels that it\u2019s still a little difficult to tend to all the customers she has.  Notwithstanding, she hopes that all the effort she\u2019s put into things will produce good results like up to now.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan and she\u2019s very happy to know that she has financial support because she\u2019ll feel surer that way of advancing with her work.

She\u2019s been separated from her spouse for many years.  She has six adult children that live with her and her grandchildren.  She built her house in a human settlement and her life hasn\u2019t been easy but she always puts a drop of optimism into everything she does.\r\n\r\nHer work consists in selling snacks and groceries in general.  She set up a small store at home where she offers all types of products.  She\u2019s open every day and her small store is always busy because it\u2019s the only one in her neighborhood that offers variety.  She\u2019s very well-known for her good humor and charisma and that attitude has led to her neighbors holding her in high esteem and her sales increase as a result.\r\n\r\nThe need to be independent and to cover daily household expenses were the main reasons that led her to this work.  She\u2019s been in business for five years.  She works by herself and at the beginning felt that she\u2019d never be able to have a business at home because she used to sell snacks as a street vendor from place to place.  She\u2019d get frustrated because she didn\u2019t sell very much that way.\r\n\r\nThat situation changed and now she feels more tranquil selling in the store she installed at home and was able to get with very much effort.  What she likes best is chatting with her customers and making them laugh.  She feels that the most difficult thing is having to get up very early to start tending to customers.   However, she knows that this will produce good economic results at the end of the day.  She\u2019d love someday to have a snack distributorship to sell all her products at wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan so she thanks those who make it possible for her to continue towards her objectives.  She is very committed to make her payments punctually and responsibly.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and mutually supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 700 soles to buy larger amounts of snacks and groceries to stock her store and to continue selling smoothly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1124376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks and sweets to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-05T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-04T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":111.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":111.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":123.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":131.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.06,"local_amount":101.96,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402013},{"amount":43.83,"local_amount":111.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":115.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456288},{"amount":43.64,"local_amount":111.06,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":114.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451953},{"amount":47.51,"local_amount":120.94,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447126},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":123.28,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":127.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053030},{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":131.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":135.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187959}],"funded_date":"2012-07-13T01:01:52Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":444261,"name":"Doep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doep, age 37, operates a hog-raising business as the main source of her family\u2019s income.

She is married to Jojit, an OFW (overseas contract worker), and she is a mother of one child. Marivic manages the household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \n\nMarivic operates a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) business. What she basically does is buy LPG tanks from wholesalers and sells them by the tank with a little profit. LPG tanks can range from small to regular sized tanks. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more LPG tanks to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nMarivic hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her child a good future and a high-quality education through all her hard work.

She has been married to 25-year-old Wilfredo for one year, and together they have a daughter named Ashly who is only five months old. She is Deyssi's main motivation to work hard. Deyssi lives in the house that she built on land given to her by her father. \r\n\r\nOn a professional level Deyssi works for an accounting firm in the administration department, and eventually at another business, in logistics. As a result of the income from her jobs, she was able to save enough to start her business selling beer wholesale. She set up distribution in her home, and works with the help of two people. At the beginning she was very nervous, and she thought that selling beer and working with intoxicated customers would be difficult; that's why she didn't set up a place for direct consumption, but rather started selling wholesale for consumption in restaurants, clubs, bars, or casual events. All of the profit generated by this business without a doubt has been helpful to keep reaching, step by step, for all the things that will benefit her family. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, and she feels secure developing her business. Also she once again promises to make her payments on time, as she has previously. And furthermore, she is very happy to belong to a community bank, as all of its members are very responsible and united together.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (2500 PEN), Deyssi will buy a large quantity of beer so that her business will remain well supplied.

He is a very responsible and hard-working man. His partner for 15 years is Rosa.  She is 38 years of age and they have three children together, ages 15, 6 and 3. Together they live in their own house, the same one that they were able to construct with a lot of effort and [hard] work.\r\n\r\nHis occupation is the sale of groceries, vegetables, and other food items.  He has a small shop that he has [constructed] in his home, where every day, along with his wife, he serves his customers.  They open at five in the morning and have already been in business for about a year.  Unfortunately, the revenue that he earns from sales is not enough to give his family a dignified life.  For that reason, he still works, as he has for the past eight years, as a dock worker in the river port of the city; there he is responsible for loading and unloading the boats and canoes.  Since he started his store, he has had many difficulties, like a lack of capital to replenish his stock.  However, he has improved with time and has learned to have patience.    \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He is, therefore, grateful for the opportunity and the trust that they have put in him.  He has committed himself to making [his loan] payments in a timely manner.  He is also grateful to be part of the community bank to which he belongs since he has seen that the members are responsible and supportive people.  With the requested loan (S\/. 600), he will purchase products for his grocery store since he wants to stock his store with a greater variety of products of different brands.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1124409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more groceries to supply his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-06T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-05T01:50:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":95.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":95.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":105.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":112.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":87.45,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":96.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402019},{"amount":39.88,"local_amount":95.71,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456294},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":95.26,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":104.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451958},{"amount":43.22,"local_amount":103.72,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":113.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447132},{"amount":44.05,"local_amount":105.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":116.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053036},{"amount":46.72,"local_amount":112.12,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":123.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187965}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T02:14:30Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Noah O'Brien","image":1247342}},{"id":444492,"name":"Clovice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clovice is a twenty-six-year-old hardworking man living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

She recently established a small business in front of her home, but she has done this work for 8 years.  She has always worked alone because she feels more at peace that way.  She thinks she stays organized this way and doesn't feel stressed out at work.  Sometimes, she makes cakes and sells them in the streets.  She also offers them door to door.  She generally does this work in the mornings, since in the afternoons, for 15 years now, she offers her help at an early education program at a school in her neighborhood to earn extra money.  She is very happy because she knows that all of her work activities produce income that she needs to pay for her home's basic expenses.  Nevertheless, she knows that she has to continue working very hard to maintain this situation.  She hopes to keep working to grow her business more.  In the future, she wants to buy land to build a house.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth credit with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She is thankful for the opportunity and trust that they offer her.  She promises to make her payments again in a punctual manner.  She is happy to be part of her communal bank, since she has seen that the members are very responsible people and supportive of one another.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 3,000 PEN, she will buy a larger quantity of soft drinks.  She will also buy the ingredients she needs to make the cakes that she sells."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1124525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more soft drinks to sell and to buy ingredients to make desserts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-06T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-05T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":457.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":478.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":476.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":513.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":522.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":550.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175.27,"local_amount":457.23,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":461.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402023},{"amount":183.37,"local_amount":478.35,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":483.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456298},{"amount":182.68,"local_amount":476.56,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":481.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451962},{"amount":197.02,"local_amount":513.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":519.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447136},{"amount":200.45,"local_amount":522.91,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":528.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053040},{"amount":211.21,"local_amount":550.99,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":556.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187969}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T22:43:44Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":444803,"name":"Jerly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerly is from Migpange, Bonifacio.

Her sales are cash or credit, and she collects payment daily, weekly, or biweekly. In any case, when she can't manage to sell everything in the city, she travels to the small communities located near the riverbanks; there she can sell everything, and she returns home very happy after about 10 days outside the city. \r\n\r\nDoli started this business a year ago. Sometimes she gets help from her son, who has a vehicle and helps her transport merchandise. Previously she sold food, but after six years she decided to change jobs due to the excessive competition in that field. Currently she has very good sales, and as a result she earns a good income; she hopes to keep growing and get a stable retail location. \r\n\r\nThis is the ninth loan she's had with MFP, and she appreciates all who make it possible. Also she is very committed, once again, in making her monthly payments on time.

She has been married for 29 years to Neptali, 55, her unconditional friend, and they are inseparable.  They have 4 children, 2 of whom are already adults.  Only 2 of their children live with them: Divana, 14, and Diego, 15.  They live in their own home; it was given to them as a gift when they were married.  \r\n\r\nLeni has a business selling food.  In the evenings, she set up her tables and her kitchen on the patio of her home, where she offers for sale all of the dishes that she has prepared during the day.  At the same time, she takes advantage of the opportunity to sell beverages and soft drinks.  She has been doing this work for 3 years, and she has learned to always be in good spirits and show her customers a friendly smile so that they will feel comfortable and will return.  She also has a business renting out a moto-taxi for transportation services.  For this she receives a daily sum that helps her to pay for the daily household expenses.  Her businesses are going very well, because she has a lot of customers and daily earnings.  She hopes to continue on with her work, and in the future, to have her own restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis is her 2nd loan with MFP, and she is grateful to the people who have made it possible for her to continue toward her goals.  Also, she is very committed, once again, to making her payments on time.  She is very content to belong to her communal bank, because all of the members are very good, friendly and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the sum of 1,000 Peruvian soles that she requests, she will buy all of the groceries and ingredients that she needs to prepare her dishes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1124535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her partner Riter is 42, and they have been together for 27 years. They have two children, ages 16 and 20.  She was able to buy her own house three years ago, buying it with the money she and her partner saved up over years, as previously they lived in a rented house.\r\n\r\nHer business is river transportation, carrying people or merchandise to the populated centers located on the banks of the rivers. She contracts with the merchants who will ship their products to those places, and in the case of transporting people, she only has to post a notice about her schedule and route. \r\n\r\nShe has been working for eight years in this business and it is going well. Over all this time, she has been able to obtain three large boats, and wishes to have a fleet of ten. \r\n\r\nShe carries on her work with the help of her partner and her children. Together they make journeys throughout the rivers in their region. \r\n\r\nIn addition she carries some foodstuffs, clothing and alcoholic beverages that she sells in each town where they disembark their passengers. During the time she has been in this business, she has learned to know the needs of the villagers in the areas she visits, and that has helped her to determine quantities, as well as the frequency with which she must undertake her trips. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has a loan, as this way she will feel more certain of going forward with her work.

She began her business because she was a petty trader and now she wants to improve her business skills and standard of living. She works at her business every day of the month.

Her husband works in security but his income is not enough to support the home. She began this business because she wants to generate income to support her family. She was a student at a vocational training school doing Gara dyeing.   \r\n\r\nZainab runs a provision shop where she sells sugar, bread, cheese, custard, milk, and Quaker oats. She has been running this business for seven years. She works at the business seven days per week. Her business is the only source of income she has. Her major problem is transportation costs from town to her business place. \r\n\r\nZainab has requested a loan in order to buy similar items in her shop such as sugar, bread, cheese, custard, milk, and Quaker oats. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and start up a savings account. In the future, she plans to open another shop.

In addition, she devotes time to raising pigs at home for additional income.\r\n\r\nLim is happy because she has a supportive husband who helps her manage most of the maintenance of the rice field. Together, they agreed to continue sending their children to school so that they can earn degrees and become professionals someday. Lim believes that education is one of the most important tools to alleviate poverty.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Lim is taking out a loan from HKL, a longstanding Kiva partner, to purchase timbers and construction supplies to repair and expand her house. She hopes to receive the loan from lenders to improve her family\u2019s living condition.

After a while, she managed to buy a larger, three-wheeled cart, a display case and some benches, and set up her business just outside her house.  There she prepares a variety of different foods such as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Picarones\">picarones<\/a>, 'cachangas' (a bread-like fried dough) and 'yuquitas' (yucca fries) which she sells to customers.

She sell drinks, a business she began 10 years ago as a street vendor. Over time and with urban redevelopment, she had the opportunity to buy from the city a small stand that included basic services. She personally manages the business and leaves one of her sisters in charge when she needs to attend to a business matter. \r\n\r\nShe offers natural fruit juices, milkshakes, and sandwiches at her stand, which is busiest in the mornings because her customers buy them for breakfast. Prices range from $0.50 to $1.50 for milkshakes. Her costs are not very high; therefore, her profits allow her to pay for her 8-year-old son's education.

is 33 years old and is married. He lives in a thatched house with his 27-year-old wife and a child in the Prey Chor district of Kompong Cham province. Yi, as well as other villagers, is dedicated to the farming business to earn a living. He works along with his wife in the rice field and also goes fishing in a nearby stream every day to support his family. However, the income barely seems to cover his daily costs.\r\n\r\nDue to an old and longstanding thatched house, Yi\u2019s family has encountered difficulties in their life, especially during the rainy season. The house was affected by the rain and it\u2019s not strong enough for the family to live in.

Her family lives in a very modest neighborhood on the edge of the city where hard-working families are trying their best to improve their living conditions and opportunities. Talar is also trying to participate in meeting the financial needs of her family. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income.\r\n\r\nShe has five years of experience in working from home. A year ago, she was already able to benefit from a microfinance opportunity. She successfully received and repaid a Relief International - Microfinance Iraq loan, which she used to purchase a new sewing machine and some quality fabrics. \r\n\r\nTo continue improving the services she can offer to her customers and to also improve her work conditions, she took out a new loan to purchase an iron and redesign her work area. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor; thereby, they are unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

A sewing enthusiast, the 33-year-old said she couldn't sew with the kind of high-end, designer fabrics she desired because they weren't locally available. She could only find the fabrics she wanted when she traveled around the country and abroad. So she took matters into her own hands and started a business that filled a void in the Austin market: offering high-end, quality fabrics from around the world at affordable prices. \r\n\r\n\"I never really wanted to be an entrepreneur,\" April said. \"I just wanted a store like this to open in town and I knew no one else would do it.\" She then opened The Fabricker, where she offers inventory from a variety of vendors who purchase their fabric from both famous and lesser-known local designers. \r\n\r\nThis is not how she originally envisioned her new entrepreneurial career, however. \r\n\r\nWith the encouragement of a friend who had launched a successful business with an Accion Texas Inc. loan, she applied and was approved for her own Accion loan to create an at-home business where she would sell fabric \u2013 while still working full time. Then she got laid off. Combining the Accion loan with her severance package allowed her to follow her dream and open the store. \r\n\r\nApril was always entrepreneurial, however. Before losing her job, she sold fabric at craft shows and out of her home, gaining a loyal clientele. She always managed to find excellent fabric from around the world because when her husband's job sends him out of the U.S., she sends him with a fabric budget. \r\n\r\nShe chooses fabric first by its look, then feel. \"If it's nice to the touch, if it's something I can see myself wearing, I'll buy it. But if I look at it and the print is nice, but cheaply made, I don't get it,\" she said. \r\n\r\nApril recently took out a second Accion loan. It is being used to purchase new inventory and market her business with a new outdoor sign above the entrance to the store and ads in neighborhood newsletters. \r\n\r\nThough she currently works alone, April plans to eventually hire employees. \"Being my own boss is probably the hardest job ever, and I have kids,\" April said.\" There's no one to give you answers. You need a mentor. It can be very lonely and scary, but luckily, many people have reached out to help me,\" she said. \r\n\r\nFind out more about her store and view her fabrics on her Tumbler and Facebook pages at:

7,500, he received lots of negative feedback. Several people said he'd fail. But he has proven the naysayers wrong, celebrating his fourth anniversary this year. \r\n\r\nBefore starting Caring Caress & Massage Wellness LLC, Tony, 47, worked many jobs and gained extensive experience in marketing and health care. Being an entrepreneur was always one of his dreams, so when he decided he wanted both a career change and to become his own boss, he chose the growing field of massage therapy, eventually earning his certification from High-Tech Institute, which is now Anthem College in Memphis, Tenn. \r\n\r\nCaring Caress & Massage Wellness LLC offers foot and deep tissue massages, colon hydrotherapy, and creates client information brochures on the benefits of massage therapy. Tony's business also works with the American Cancer Society by donating money and volunteering in the Relay for Life to raise cancer research funds. \r\n\r\nHe is currently the only massage therapist in his studio, but he plans to hire another to assist him and expand the business. He presently employs a licensed colon hydrotherapist and a person who does manicures and pedicures. And he wants to eventually hire a chiropractor. \r\n\r\nEarly in his new career as an entrepreneur, Tony attended a seminar where he found out about Accion Texas. He kept up with Accion via emails, and when he found about the grand opening of an office in his area, he decided to apply for a loan. He was approved and the loan proceeds will allow him to buy equipment and supplies, such as the Steamy Wonder TM. This product is essentially a portable sauna and helps clients detoxify and lose weight without body wraps. Tony also plans to purchase and sell a line of home-use wellness products in his studio. \r\n\r\nAlways eager to increase his knowledge and help people, Tony is an active member of the American Massage Therapy Association. Through this affiliation, he receives liability insurance that covers him anywhere he works, and receives discounted rates on educational classes and new products. \"They do a ton of research and share that with us,\" Tony said. \"And clients have found me through the organization's website. I wouldn't want to be without them.\" \r\n\r\nTony also works health fairs, gives chair massages in offices, sells gift certificates and passes out marketing fliers \u2013 all with an eye toward growing his clientele and expanding his business. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about Tony's company and services, visit the following sites: http:\/\/www.caringcaressmassageandwellness.com and

She has been doing this work for a year, and it is going well.

She started her business to have some additional income, because her salary was not sufficient to cover all of the expenses of her children.

They have no children and for the moment are living in her in-laws\u2019 house.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling fast-food (sausages with chicken, fried chicken and others typical of the region) and soft-drinks.  To do so she sets up a table in front of her house where she tends to her customers who for the most part are her neighbors.  She starts her work in the afternoon preparing her dishes because she works mornings as a teacher at a local school.  She is happy because with this business she\u2019s able to earn income in addition to her monthly teacher\u2019s salary that she can use to cover all her family\u2019s expenses.  The problem is that she ends up very tired after all the day\u2019s work but despite this she wants to continue with her business until she can have a locale where she can take care of her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan.  She comments that she\u2019s grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit to reach her goals.
