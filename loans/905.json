He is a foreman on a nearby farm and raises pigs and chickens on land that his employer set aside for him to use for his business.  The extra income he makes from selling the animals has allowed him to improve his family's quality of life.  Consequently, he is constantly looking for ways to grow the business.  He learned everything he needed to know to raise animals at a farm where he worked before, but only to care for the owner's animals.

She learned to fish from her husband who taught her how and she does it to help him with the household economy since she did not find a job.  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning she was afraid of the waves and the dangers inherent in this profession but as time went by she became accustomed to it.  She likes the fresh air and she does not get seasick.  \r\n\r\nThey work from Monday through Saturday from 5am until 11am and then take their catches to be sold.  They only work these days because that\u2019s when small vendors buy the most and they use Sundays to repair their nets.  \r\n\r\nAmalia\u2019s and her husband\u2019s greatest concern is robbers and pirates that steal the catches of fish, they steal motors and sometimes damage the boats which is why when her husband finishes the day\u2019s work he gets help to store his motor at home because it\u2019s new and he put in a lot of effort to acquire it.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been fishing for 13 years and feels that she\u2019s finally getting good results because she\u2019s been able to fix up her house and to buy a new motor for the boat making it more comfortable.  The loan she\u2019s requesting is to buy nets because they are deteriorated and to make some improvements to the boat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1126979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy nets and equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-06T21:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-05T21:50:14Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia Cecibel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.24,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":88.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":89.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":94.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":109.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":152.89,"local_amount":149.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":152.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294286833},{"amount":81.91,"local_amount":80.25,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":81.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340402},{"amount":83.79,"local_amount":82.09,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096774},{"amount":86.24,"local_amount":84.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331130},{"amount":87.67,"local_amount":85.89,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939773},{"amount":90.09,"local_amount":88.27,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072193},{"amount":91.72,"local_amount":89.86,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":91.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318552},{"amount":93.81,"local_amount":91.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":93.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013296},{"amount":96.38,"local_amount":94.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":96.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453660},{"amount":97.98,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459506},{"amount":112.52,"local_amount":110.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087842}],"funded_date":"2012-07-30T01:31:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":445508,"name":"Mwanamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanamisi is 26 years old, married, and has two children.

He is IDP and lives with his family in Bilasuavr IDP Settlement. He is farmer and raises seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 28 years. Tapdiq is on pension. \r\n\r\nOver the years, Tapdiq gained enough skills and experience to run the business thanks to his father`s experience. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy; many national dishes made of vegetable, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch. Tapdiq usually sells his crops in the central bazaar.

They have six children, two of whom are independent and living away from their parents.  The other four children live with their parents in the Daniel Hernandez neighborhood, in a house that they own.  \r\n\r\nJuana decided to open a grocery 4 years ago.  She operates the business in a space in her house.  She sells bread--hot from the oven--drinks, vegetables and--just recently--hanks of wool.  Many of Juana's neighbors like to knit and now they can buy wool from her.  She has managed to grow the business, bit by bit, and says that her goal is to expand because she \"hasn't yet been able to stock all the merchandise\" that she'd like to sell.  Even so, she is happy with the progress she's made and is planning future improvements to the store.  She knows what she needs, but she doesn't have enough money to carry out her plans.  Her husband is a day laborer, doing farm work on various local farms, and all of his income goes to paying the family's expenses.  \r\n\r\nThis is Juana's 3rd MFP loan.  She is grateful for your help because past loans have allowed her to improve her business and, in turn, her income.  She knows that she has to repay this loan in the agreed-upon time to get future loans.  Juana will use this loan to stock her store with snacks, drinks and other everyday

Settlement with his wife and one son. He is a farmer and has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the past 25 years. He chose this business because it is profitable, and a fresh crop is in high demand. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy; many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits serve every table in Azerbaijan households and also make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nTehran sells his crop in the Bilasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 100 AZN.

Time has brought about increased demand, and he was able to increase his customers with the previous loan which served him well.   Mr. Andrew is a hard worker who is grateful to the institution for the support it has

Little by little he has been able to grow this business thanks to his job.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy more general products such as rice, noodles, flour, sugar, oil and other products. Thanks to this investment, he continues to sell high quality products, consequently increasing his sales and his income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1131712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more general products such as rice, noodles, flour, sugar and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Samburu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":164,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ngome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1113}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294475006},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301528442},{"amount":13.99,"local_amount":1119.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308510166},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":3324,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3494.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315526208},{"amount":12.59,"local_amount":1007.39,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323125702},{"amount":42.96,"local_amount":3436.61,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3612.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331272849},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T19:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339649319},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":2224,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T17:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2338,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347206618}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T04:14:20Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T17:03:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ericka Ward","image":789780}},{"id":445555,"name":"Amos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amos is 24 years old.

She is 31 years old and  married with 3 children. Her husband works as a bricklayer. Her business started in 2010 when she won the lottery and decided to invest all of her winnings in the launch of her own business, a small convenience store. She opens the store at 7:00 AM and closes it at 8:00 PM. The advantage she has in her business is that there are no nearby businesses; she has little competition. Eloisa is requesting this loan in order to invest it in the purchase of products such as lard, sausages, chicken, soft drinks, sugar, beans and rice, among other products. The challenges Eloisa faces result from the fact that people are buying less these days, due to the rising price of basic groceries. The business will change with this loan since she will be able to offer a wider variety of products and will be able to sell more as a result. Her goals are to be able to help her children move ahead, to help her husband with the household expenses, to grow her business so that it is larger and more productive, and to improve her quality of life. This is the first loan that Eloisa has requested from Kiva\u2019s partner FAMA.

He is the second child of five and at 20 years of age he began to work for himself. He began as a laborer and got a lot of experience in this line of work but it was not sufficient because he had greater economic needs. After that, he began as an assistant on a bus and after some months earned the job of driving the bus. Because of his good driving he won the owner's confidence and became after a year and a half the driver of this bus. In this way, his income improved considerably.\r\n\r\nShortly after, he met who is now his wife because she used to take this bus. They now have been married twelve years. According to his own statements, he is happy and they live a full life, saying that if God allows them to have a baby his happiness will be even greater. \r\n\r\nThey are both excellent and very responsible people.

She began her business two years ago with the sale of clothing which helped her get enough money to begin raising chickens and pigs. Mayra likes animals a lot and it was for this reason that she moved from the clothing business to dedicate herself completely to raising of animals. She realized that it gave her better results although it requires more patience. \r\n\r\nBecause the house where she lives is her own and she has a lot of space for a suitable pen for her animals. She is also far from the city, so she does not bother her neighbors with the noise. The caring, cleaning and feeding of these animals is done by herself everyday. She goes out only two days a week to sell her products until finished. She does her work in this way because she is far from the city and the transfer demands her money and time. The sale price of her products are $1.40 per pound of chicken and $2.80 per pound of pork. She has many customers because her animals are local and fresh, which is most appreciated about her meats. \r\n\r\nMayra has not had  major difficulties and hopes to continue this way because she is a single mother and the only means of support for her family. She has three children of 6, 10 and 3 years of age. Two of her children study in public schools and the youngest is her assistant. With the loan that she is requesting, she will buy chickens and pigs to raise. Her dream is to have many animals to raise and sell. She would also like to equip the areas where the animals are located to improve the cleanliness and to raise higher quality products, hoping to continue helping her children in their studies.

is a resident of an area called Nkubu in Central Kenya, where she has been practicing mixed farming for nearly 30 years. Her farm produces French beans, maize, cabbage, and potatoes for the local market. She is married with four adult children.\r\n\r\nFlorence has requested a loan of 41,600 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.

is a 61-year-old man who is widowed and living with his two sons.

They have basic electricity services. \r\n\r\nAngel is an experienced and hardworking man who has dedicated the last 20 years of his life to raising animals (mainly sheep and poultry), which are sold once they reach the ideal size and weight. Moreover, he also has a small crop of lemons that he harvests on a weekly basis and sells in the local market. This helps him to have slightly diversified income streams. \r\n\r\nAs Angel has gotten older, he has developed strong expertise in his area of activity and is very committed to his business. Hence, he is now looking to get  a loan of 1000 soles to invest in his animals and his crops. In particular, he wants to buy animal feed and fertilizers for his lemon crop. Because the area is relatively remote, the 'Capital Semilla' incentive with the support of Kiva allows Angel to have access to credit that takes into account his situation.

The products that she sells most of are rice, sugar, oil, cookies, etc.  She buys these every week in order to stock her store.  Vicenta runs her store and serves her customers alone although her 12-year-old son sometimes helps her.  She will use her loan to buy merchandise.

is a housewife and a small entreprenuer who lives in Cataggaman with her spouse and children. She has three adult children who have their own employment now but still live with her and her husband. Instead of lazing at home, Genie has opened a specialized store selling books, magazines and other reading materials. Her hobby is to read books and she is very happy to have this type of business. \r\n\r\nGenie usually earns about PHP 15,000 each month and uses this for daily meals and monthly electricity bills. Other parts of her income are also used to reinvest in the business. Genie would like to buy more books, magazines and encyclopedias to re-sell for profit and is therefore asking for a loan of PHP 50,000. This will help to increase her sales and earn additional revenue. Someday, Genie hopes to establish a larger store with convenient shelves to display her books.

ella ademas de tener sembrado platano, caf\u00e9, tambien ha comenzado desde el a\u00f1o anterior el cultivo de papa, para este \u00faltimo cultivo es que requiere financiamiento, para la compra de fertilizantes y pesticidas, para asegurarse una buena cosecha, la misma se comercializa por medio de compradores de papa que se desplazan hasta la zona y la llevan a otros lugares para venderla.\nEsta es una actividad familiar donde participa tambien su esposo, Miguel Angel, esta es una familia que vive de la explotaci\u00f3n de la finca, como unica fuente de ingreso, por esta raz\u00f3n cuando se da la cosecha de caf\u00e9 y la de la papa, deben guardar dinero para poder hacerle frente a los gastos de todo el a\u00f1o, lo que complementan con la venta de platanos, cultivo que tiene un ciclo de producci\u00f3n mas corto.\nComo un plan a futuro desean poder seguir ayudando a su hija a continuar sus estudios asi como ir ampliando la zona de cultivo de papa, ya que han visto que es un producto que se da muy bien en la zona.","en":"Mar\u00eda de los Angeles lives in Puntarenas province located in the Agua Buena district of Coto Brus canton in southern Costa Rica, where the first Italian immigrant families who received land from the government began planting coffee. Later, they diversified by producing basic grains and raising livestock suited to the area's topography.\r\n\r\nLast year, in addition to planting bananas and coffee, Mar\u00eda also began planting potatoes, which requires funding to buy fertilizers and pesticides to ensure a good harvest. This harvest is purchased by potato buyers who sell in the area and other locations. Hers is a family activity in which her husband Miguel Angel also works. The farm is the family's sole source of income. This means that money from the coffee and potato harvests, plus that garnered from banana sales from a much shorter growing period, must suffice to pay expenses for the entire year.\r\n\r\nTheir plan is to continue paying for their daughter's education and expanding their potato plantings, which do very well in this area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1128015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and pesticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coto Brus","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":408.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":408.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":408.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1225,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":612010.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614304}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T19:33:51Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":445805,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie is 47 years old and lives in Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

It is known for low availability of employment for people over 40, which is the case with the majority of the members of this group.  Therefore, these women need to generate a source of self-employment.  They manage to do this by selling products by catalog.  They sell a great variety of goods like personal care items, clothes, household goods, and jewelry, etc.  Five of the members will use the loan to invest in this.  Two of the members make underwear.  They sell their products through their colleagues, which creates greater solidarity between them.\r\n\r\nEven though these women live close to the Panamanian border, where there is a very strong commercial zone, they have the opportunity to sell their products.

The Khmer natural medicines are made of many kinds of tree roots and do not cause bad effects on people\u2019s health.

Moreover, she and her husband also work for others for pay for extra income for her family's sake. She has been with her current business for 10 years and she can earn about 14,400 KHR per day. However, the shortage of water supply for her rice farm remains the main challenge for her family. \r\n\r\nThis is the first cycle for Arng while it is the second cycle for her group member. She and her co-member are requesting a loan of 300,000 KHR and 1,000,000 KHR, respectively. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for farmland and she hopes to grow her rice healthily so that she can earn more

Gabriel has always worked on the land, sometimes for other people but most often on his own land.  Although he knows a lot about producing a number of different types of crops such as sugarcane, corn, beans and oranges, coffee is the crop that has given him the best results.  During his last harvest he produced a total of 5 tons which he sold to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d who processed them and exported them.  Right now, Gabriel needs a loan to buy fertilizers and coffee plants.  He has 2,000 plants and would like to buy another 500.  With the purchase of the fertilizer, his production will increase to 6 tons and, with the purchase of the plants, he will be producing a total of 7 tons in two years time.  Gabriel's four children help him work in his fields while his wife, Hortencia, takes care of the housework.

He has already taken out a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq in the past, which he used to renovate the garage. After successful repayment of his first loan, he decided to continue to invest in his business and took out a new loan to purchase quality tools for the auto repair shop. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor and, thereby, unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it, making a little profit. Her products are decorative plastic flowers, plants, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more decorative plastic flowers and plants to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElsa hopes to expand soon. She dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She also dreams of having her own house and lot someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. At these meetings, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her goal for later on is to have her own house; this is her greatest dream. She works carefully every day, and that makes it very evident that everything she earns is invested in generating income. Lately, she has been selling cooked food, taking advantage of her three years as a merchant. She knows a lot about the public market where she is.\r\n\r\nWith this food selling business, she generates additional income, which increases her family\u2019s well-being every day. However, she has insufficient working capital to meet her customers\u2019 demand for fruit, vegetables, cheese, and whey.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with Yehu Microfinance. She will use the loan to buy wholesale fruits and vegetables. This will increase her working capital, and there will be enough profits produced by her Kiva loan to invest in her restaurant business. This promises to be successful because she does it within the framework of the market demand.

is Leonila, 42, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is a single parent to her children and she is the only one raising her children. She manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeonila operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a direct selling business for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonila is hoping to be able to expand soon and to increase the number of her loyal customers. She dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1132402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":480,"local_amount":19999.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20057.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303391},{"amount":240,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356112},{"amount":320,"local_amount":13333.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13371.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114212},{"amount":160,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6686.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350272}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T18:04:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":445963,"name":"Alfred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfred is single and a very hardworking man who, since his early age, has done nothing more than work to help support his parents.

She is a mother to her children and is married to Elpidio, her business partner.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNorafil operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNorafil dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She also hopes to have her own food stall someday.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his family in Bilasuvar IDP settlement.   He breeds cows and cattle, and sells milk and milk products as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Qafar has more than 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him the best way to look after cattle.\r\n\r\nQafar usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in 5 to 6 months, and then resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  He sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings an income of  90 AZN per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan.
