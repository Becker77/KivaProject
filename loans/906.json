He runs a farm where he raises cows, sheep, and hens. He also grows apple, walnut, and pear trees and cultivates potatoes and beans. Despite such a variety of agricultural activities, the main income Nver receives from the cattle by selling meat, milk, and other agricultural products. Therefore, Nver would like to purchase more cattle and increase his income. With the requested loan amount, he plans to purchase five calves. Such development of cattle husbandry will provide additional income for Nver and his family. \r\n\r\nNver lives with his wife, two daughters (14 and 7 years old), 12-year-old son, and pensioner mother. Nver's wife and mother support him with agriculture. Nver wishes to provide access to higher education for his children in the future. Current development of agriculture is important for him to have a good background to make his dream come true.

is a 28 year old man who is very friendly and hard working. He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and two daughters in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He is a farmer and has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 10 years.  Elvin was unemployed and did not have an educational degree.  When he got married he needed a financial resource to support his new family so he started his business. \r\n\r\nWithin two years Elvin gained enough skills and experience to run the business, thanks to his father`s experience. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy.  Many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma.  Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and also make fresh punch. Elvin usually sells his crops in the central bazaar.

The best liquor in the province and in all of Ecuador is distilled here. \r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to come together and form a Communal Bank, which has benefited them greatly, since with the loans they have been able to improve their small businesses. They are employed in diverse activities, such as business, the services, and food sales, among others. \r\n\r\nIn this place, we met Letty. She is 41 years old and is in a common-law marriage from which she has four children \u2013 one adult and three others ages 16, 12, and 10 years, who are still in school. Her husband works in agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn order to earn an income and help her husband with the household expenses, some years ago our friend assisted him in constructing a small farmyard where they raise pigs. Little by little, they also built a small chicken coop. She tells us that this has allowed them to help their children with school expenses. She buys the animals when they are young, raises them for three months, and later delivers them to merchants in the local market; her children and husband help her out. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of food and medications for both the chickens and the pigs. She has been with the Communal Bank since its inception, and she likes it because of the assistance that the bank offers her. Her dream is that her children will have a good education.

The people of Cuenca are warm-hearted, friendly, and courteous. They still maintain the culture and traditions of the native peoples.\r\n\r\nGladys is thirty years old and married with two children of twelve and eight years of age. Her older son is in high school and her younger daughter is studying in a little school in the city. Her husband has his own shop where he makes furniture. They don't own a house and so live in a rented one.\r\n\r\nGladys tells us that at the moment she finds herself enjoying very good health, along with all the other members of her family.\r\n\r\nGladys works jointly with her husband making furniture, a business that they have maintained for the past ten years.

In 1998, searching for a source of income for her family, Buazhar began her own business selling groceries with a initial investment of 10,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Buazhar managed to grow her business with monthly earnings of about 20,000 soms (KGS).

At this time, she is working hard to send her children to college and to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlbina operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other products of the like. One of the products is belts, but what she focuses on selling right now are kitchen utensils. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to the low prices and the many options they are offered. Albina's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 25,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAlbina dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all the hard work on her business. She also hopes to expand her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is married to Evangeline, a businesswoman, and is the father of four children, of whom three are in elementary school and one is in high school. By the grace of God, Fredelito has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to send them to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Fredelito, as he himself has been a college graduate, and he believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nFredelito operates a buy and sell business, specifically, diapers. What he basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it piecemeal to make a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other products of the like, but as mentioned earlier, he focuses on selling diapers. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options offered. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a loan of 50,000 pesos. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantity and variety of products to expand his inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nFredelito dreams of being able to give his children a good and high-quality education through all his hard work on his business. He is hoping to be able to expand soon and to increase the number of his loyal customers. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week. At these meetings, he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1133077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

They are adults now and have their own families.  Unfortunately, due to different circumstances, several years ago he decided to divorce his wife.  He has always been a very cheerful, enthusiastic and hard-working person and has dedicated much effort to providing for his children.   Out of necessity, he had to work and earn a living, so he was unable to get professional training, but would have liked to.  In his free time he plays soccer with his sons and friends, and sometimes makes a delicious \"Saltado de Carne\" meat dish to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and thanks to the support of his children, Luis became a farmer and has a small patch of land where he grows beans.  He gets up very early in the morning to carry out his different farm chores and works around ten hours a day.  He enjoys his work because he has always liked the countryside.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he can cover crop expenses and maintenance, and also buy the necessary fertilizer.  This means he will be able to keep his crop in good condition and earn a good profit at harvest time.

necesidad de trabajar y solventar sus gastos no pudo cursar una carrera profesional, pero le hubiera gustado mucho poder estudiar la carrera de Veterinaria; en sus ratos libres le gusta ver pel\u00edculas junto con su peque\u00f1o y en algunas ocasiones cocina un riqu\u00edsimo Picante de Cochayullo para compartir con su familia.\nPor iniciativa propia y gracias al apoyo de su pareja, Elka se dedica a la agricultura, ella cuenta con una peque\u00f1a parcela donde siembra frejoles, desde tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana Elka se dedica a realizar diversas labores de campo, ella puede trabajar un aproximado de 10 horas diaria y se encuentra muy a gusto con el trabajo que realiza ya que siempre le ha gustado el campo.\nElka se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestatarios

She has always been a very cheerful, enthusiastic and hard-working person and she has joined forces with her partner in order to make progress.  Sadly, owing to her need to work and cover her costs, Elka was not able to study for a degree.  She would really like to have been able to study for a degree in veterinary medicine.  In her free time, she enjoys watching movies together with her little one and sometimes she enjoys cooking a delicious 'picante de Cochayullo' to share with her family.\r\n\r\nThrough her own initiative and thanks to her partner's support, Elka works as a farmer.  She has a small plot of land where she grows beans.  From very early in the morning, Elka carries out her farm work.  She can work approximately 10 hours a day and is very happy with the work that she does because she has always liked farming.\r\n\r\nElka is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help they provide, she will be able to cover her costs and maintain her crops, buying the fertilizer she needs.  This will enable her to keep her crops in good condition and, when she finishes harvesting, she will make good profits which, in the not-so-distant future, she hopes to be able to use to start growing different crops.  This will enable her to guarantee her young son's future and well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1129123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to cover the cost of maintaining her crops.

He lives with his wife and his three children in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. Before he was a herder and used to herd sheep, horse and cows in the countryside. But his family moved to the city due to the heavy freezes of consecutive years in Mongolia. His family owns an old house and small land plot in the ger district. A ger is a Mongolian nomadic tent. Since his house was built, it never had any complete repair or renovations. Currently it looses a lot of heat through the old floor, ceiling and entrance hall. This is why he has decided to make repairs and insulate them. He totally hopes that his cost for coal fuel will be cut after the repair. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to cover the costs for his house repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1133155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He lives with his family in his recently purchased house and land plot in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His house has some problems such as heat loss and damages to its roof, inside walls etc. This is why he is planning to make repairs and insulate them using rock wool, cement and red bricks. Also he will replace his furnace which uses smoky coal with a smokeless one. He thinks his home will be warmer after the wall and roof insulation and a new smart furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to buy some building materials and new smokeless furnace for his home repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1133138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy some building materials and a new smokeless furnace for his home repair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-07-08T11:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-07T11:10:12Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lkhasuren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34000},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49154.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49162.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":48069.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52833.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51965.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":53361.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57815.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56348.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56955.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61109.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61840.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61944.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65058.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66750.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":67901.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70251.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":70685.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":74318.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":76524.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77565.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79649.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81924.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74809.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1502437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369478}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T10:26:01Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":446366,"name":"Chum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chum, 37, is a single parent who lives with her only child in Baray district of Kompong Tom province.

Known to her neighbors and customers as Concha, she is requesting a loan to stock her business with more vegetables, fruits, and basic grains. Her goal is to always offer fresh fruits and vegetables, which requires more business capital daily, since fruits and vegetables are very expensive. Corn, which she sells to local women who make tortillas, is also very expensive.

of 46 years of age, married, and has three children, out of which two are students. Aziz works as an engineer at a factory, and his monthly income barely is enough for daily life. His wife works as a teacher, and a teacher's salary is also small. Therefore they can never save up money for repair of their apartment. \r\n\r\nIn order to do repairs they need a large sum of money, and they don't have this amount.

The profits will enable him not only to grow and extend his business with the goal of becoming a major poultry farmer but also to support himself day to day.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1134955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

has four children. She is employed as a cook in the local hospital, where she works until 2 pm. As a second source of income for her family, she has been working in animal husbandry for 13 years \u2014 she started this business with practically nothing. Thanks to Zamira's hard work, her business now has 2 cows, a calf, and 8 sheep and goats. Monthly profits from the business are about 12,000 soms (KGS). Last winter was very cold and long, which resulted in livetock losses and a large increase in the cost of feed. So Zamira has decided to make a purchase a load of feed and hay, establishing a reserve as insurance against the risk of seasonal price increases. With this goal, Zamira has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 135,000 soms (KGS).

cotton, grape, paprika, lima beans and others, likewise you can find many agricultural exporting companies which give jobs to the inhabitants of the zone. \r\n\r\nJuana is the mother of 5 children, the youngest of whom is 14 and she works very hard to be able to give him a dignified life, and above all the good example that with hard work and honesty one can achieve anything one sets out to do.\r\n\r\nOn her free time, Juana likes to watch television but what she likes the most is to cook one of her favourite dishes, the delicious \"Chicharrones\".\r\n\r\nShe was only able to study up to the third grade of secondary school but she would have loved to study Business Management.\r\n\r\nWith effort and above all dedication, Juana, or Juanita as she likes to be called works in her business selling \"salchipollos\" [hot dog and chicken], burgers, \"patasca\" [a highly nutritious beef and sheep soup], fried chicken, sodas and others, she works around 5 hour a day and on weekends she works around 8 hours because there are more customers; She can serve up to 25 customer a day and she believes her business is good because she is kind with her customers and above all because she has a good flavour for the preparation of her dishes and therefor her customers always come back. \r\n\r\nJuana is really grateful with the lenders of Kiva because thanks to their help she will be able to buy tables, chairs and fix her sandwich cart that gets damaged often and sometimes slows her when serving her customers; With this improvement she will be able to serve her customers faster and give them more comfortable premises, with that she will improve her profits and will be able to continue working towards her biggest dream, to have a big restaurant to serve her chicken."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1130085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Cambodia. She has six children, of whom two daughters and one son are still dependent on her. She has planted rice and raised pigs for ten years and supplements her income by selling groceries. She can earn around KHR 12,000 per day from her current businesses.\r\n\r\nSophat has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles and successfully paid back the past loans, while the other members of her group have been with VisionFund for two cycles.

She only has a secondary-level education, but she would have liked to study business administration.\r\n\r\nMartha puts a lot of effort into her beauty salon, to which she devotes around 10 hours each day and serves up to 12 clients daily. She is very creative and above all, organized. Martha believes that this is why her business does well, and also because she is very friendly toward her clients.\r\n\r\nMartha is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to their help, she will be able to purchase materials for her salon, like good quality dyes, talcum powder, hair creams, wholesale shampoo, scissors, and hair clippers, among other things. With this improvement, she will have the necessary materials to be able to perform her work and above all, to provide better service to her clients and increase her income. In this way, she will continue working and struggling to make her greatest dream a reality: \"to finish building our house from good quality materials and to have a great beauty salon.\"\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1130095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase salon supplies (good quality dyes, talcum powder, hair creams, wholesale shampoo, scissors, and hair clippers, among other things)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-08T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-07T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":203.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":207.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":215.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":227.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":232.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":244.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":251.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":275.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":282.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":293.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":304.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Wegmann","image":null}},{"id":446563,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 29-year-old Lebanese single man.

is a farmer. For nine years, she has operated a farm where she raises and sells such vegetables as maize, beans, and kale. She and her husband have two children, ages five and 11 years old. She describes herself as an honest woman. Her business's primary customers are the local residents of her neighborhood. She describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient water for irrigation. \r\n\r\nRodah has requested a Kes 21,000 loan.

She previously accessed an 12,000 PHP loan that she used to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her child and in their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 15,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her child. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNovie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

From this seaweed is extracted carrageenan, a valuable substance used in products that need gelling, suspending, thickening, emulsifying and water-holding properties.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan worth 6,000PHP which he will use to buy materials for seaweed farming such as seedlings, rope and nets.\r\n\r\nFaustino works hard to support his wife and their four children, aged 16, 10, 9 and six years old. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Faustino hopes to further improve his business and maybe invest in a more lucrative venture. In addition, he aims to continually send his four children to school for better education and learning. He wants to put some of his income into savings for future use."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1133943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials for seaweed farming such as seedlings, rope and nets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talibon, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10.149167 124.325","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustino \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":272.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":1363.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294309118},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":1090.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301364215},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":1090.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308123469},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":1724.51,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315358980},{"amount":18.25,"local_amount":730,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":761.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323511637}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T13:53:53Z","paid_date":"2012-12-18T09:45:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Burrell","image":null}},{"id":446903,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda is a 32-year-old resident of Bohol, Philippines.

She is married to Nelson and is the mother of three children, all of whom are already working. By the grace of God, Milagros has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to sustain her family's needs for everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagros maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer's prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers invest in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Milagros is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMilagros dreams of being able to expand her business.

She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRowena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rowena earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the unit. Her store is adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, Rowena is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRowena hopes to soon be able to expand and to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
