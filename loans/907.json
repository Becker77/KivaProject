This is why she works hard every day in her dressmaking workshop, with the aim of improving her household income and making progress in life.  When her children's father abandoned her, Luz Marina started working hard in her dressmaking activities.  She was already familiar with this work thanks to a family member who worked in the same business and who she used to help out occasionally.  Thanks to the experience she already had, Luz Marina was able to start up her own workshop and provide dressmaking services to third parties.  Thanks to the good quality of her products, she currently has very good orders from her customers.  Owing to the fact that she doesn't have a lot of capital, she faces certain difficulties when people place large orders with her.  However, she now has the opportunity to take out a loan and buy the supplies and raw materials she needs to fill her orders.  She is also able to have her three sewing machines serviced.  This will enable her to overcome the problems she faces as a result of her lack of capital and she will be able to make progress in her business.  Her biggest dream is to create jobs in her dressmaking workshop and to teach the business to other people so that they can provide for their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1130504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and raw materials so that she can fill some orders that customers have placed.

She has gained a lot of experience and dexterity in her business. She lives with her husband and her son in an area of the city that has no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. \r\n\r\nMrs. Enkhtuya owns a house that was built in the early 1990s and has never undergone repairs or renovations. In the last several years, the poor insulation has caused heat loss and emissions trough the house's walls and windows. This causes her to spend too much money on smoky coal to warm her home in the winter time. \r\n\r\nAlso, Mrs. Enkhtuya thinks using coal is very harmful to the environment, especially due to air pollution. This is why she wants to insulate her house. Now she needs some money to buy the building materials such as the foam, cement, bricks and rock wool for wall insulation. She is planning to do it within the summer months. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Additionally, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that use less gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy some building materials to insulate her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1134061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Thanks to his dedication, he has generated income which enables him to offer his family a better quality of life. The business started out as distributing snacks and cookies. William has various areas where he sells and supplies a large number of businesses. Later, he was given opportunities in the area and set up a cybercafe and video games in his business. Through this initiative, his income has increased considerably and his family has also had the opportunity to have a better quality of life and better economic opportunities in order to progress. William carries out his snack and cookie distribution in a vehicle that he bought through a high interest loan since he previously had not had the option of accessing a financial institution. However, now he is seeking a loan to pay for the vehicle he uses to distribute snacks and cookies so he will have to pay less interest.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to continue to have good sales in his business and to continue to offer his family a good quality of life. Also, he hopes to continue growing and to have more customers in different areas of the city to generate more jobs, since right now he has the opportunity to create a job at his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1130509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to pay for a vehicle to distribute snacks and cookies, and therefore pay less interest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barbosa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William Dario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113937},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117127},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120407},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123778},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127244},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130807},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134469},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138234},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142105},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146084},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150174},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154379},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158702},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163145},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167714},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172410},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177237},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182200},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187301},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192546}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.23,"local_amount":111450,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":112473.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378565},{"amount":66.78,"local_amount":119614,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":120712.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433217},{"amount":207.38,"local_amount":371429,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":374841.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029659},{"amount":148.11,"local_amount":265276,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":267713.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548296},{"amount":1190.5,"local_amount":2132231,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2151820.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":697631495}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T05:48:03Z","paid_date":"2015-08-21T12:22:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":447007,"name":"Jonalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonalyn is 37 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nJonalyn works hard to provide for her family.

With great effort, she has managed to set up a chicken run again in the new house and is therefore requesting a loan to buy 40 chickens and food to fatten them up, so that she can start raising chickens once again.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to start generating household income again and be able to get through this difficult period in her life, so that her son can benefit from having access to a high quality education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1130508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 40 chickens and food to fatten them up, so that she can start raising chickens once again.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Amag\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligia Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84131},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86486},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88908},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91397},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93957},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96587},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99292},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102072},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104930},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107868},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110888},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113993},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117185},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120467}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":81889,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83874.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378564},{"amount":47.65,"local_amount":84081,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":86119.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433216},{"amount":755.95,"local_amount":1334030,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1366380.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617638}],"funded_date":"2012-07-16T22:17:03Z","paid_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":446999,"name":"Zainab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainab runs a primary school to earn a living.

With the experience she acquired while working, she has been able to run several businesses that allowed her to get ahead: first, a beauty salon; then a general store; and for the past 5 years, a cafeteria that she opened with considerable effort and allows her to contribute financially, along with her husband, to a better life for their household. The cafeteria was opened with limited capital; therefore, she has not been able to offer the services and range of products that would attract a larger number of customers. \r\n\r\nSo she is requesting a loan to buy needed supplies to offer breakfast and lunch in her cafeteria. This way she will be able to diversify and increase her sales so that she will have higher household income and her family will enjoy a better life and more economic opportunities for advancement.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1130512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy needed supplies to offer breakfast and lunch in her cafeteria.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89423},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91921},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94489},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97128},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99841},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102630},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105496},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108443},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111472},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114586},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117786},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121076},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124458},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127935},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131508},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135181},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138957},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142839},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146828},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150930},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155145},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159479},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163934},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168515}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":447016,"name":"Gantumur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gantumur, 39, is a builder who lives with his family in a ger, a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt, in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He did this 38 years ago in order to become a coffee producer.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Romulo now produces ten tons of organic coffee annually.  He sells it to the Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco to be exported.  One of the concerns that he now has is performing all of the most technical processes involved with coffee.  This way he would be able to take better advantage of the resources he has.

Principalmente fabrica herraduras que vende en su gran mayor\u00eda a un comerciante de otro municipio que las vende al minorista, y de esta manera genera los ingresos que requiere en su hogar para pagar los gastos que all\u00ed se generan y brindarle a su hijo una educaci\u00f3n universitaria. Debido a que en el momento tiene grandes pedidos por parte de sus clientes, pero no cuenta con el capital suficiente para poder comprar las materias primas, Jorge busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar materias primas como varilla y carb\u00f3n industrial para fabricar los grandes pedidos que tiene por parte de sus clientes.\n\nDe esta manera lograr\u00e1 superar la dificultad de capital y as\u00ed seguir\u00e1 progresando en su taller generando m\u00e1s ingresos para que en su hogar puedan tener una buena calidad de vida.

This way, Guilda will considerably reduce her transportation expenses and save more money to invest in her future expansion plans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1134153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"to purchase a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Ain","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T18:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T18:00:41Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301319627},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308075632},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310062},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918376},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440368},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993052},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735662},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441056},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846295},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614534},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472054}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T22:13:53Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:42:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":445386,"name":"Sok Kean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sok Kean is 37 years old and her husband, Channa (pictured together) is 40 years old, have been married since 1997 and they have five children, who all attend school.

They started their business selling food a long time ago, and thanks to the good quality of their products they have managed to make very good sales and gradually expand the business. This has allowed them to have a better quality of life at home and greater financial stability.\r\n\r\nNicolas has always wanted to have his own food stall, but since he didn't have enough capital to own a place for his business, they have always sold their food door to door. That is why now that they have the opportunity to set up a location, he is requesting a loan that will allow them to buy chairs, tables, and kitchen supplies, such as plates and silverware, so that they can set up their food stall.\r\n\r\nThis will allow him to achieve his dream and sales will also improve, because the business will have a fixed location and become more visible to his customers. His greatest hope is that his business will offer him good stability, which in turn will provide a good quality of life at home and opportunities for financial advancement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1130796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chairs, tables, and kitchen supplies like plates and silverware, in order to set up his food stall.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The two older ones are studying in the university and the two younger ones are in school and kindergarten. Her husband drives a taxi. Our friend, apart from being a great housewife, also sells clothes of all kinds, like handbags and sneakers, among others. She sells door-to-door. She walks around selling from Monday to Friday, in the mornings or in the afternoons. She leaves the products on credit and she collects the money every week. To buy her merchandise and get supplies of products, she travels to the city of Guayaquil and they also send her merchandise from the United States, since she has family there.

She was the youngest daughter and, hence, devoted a lot of time to household duties.  Because her older sisters and brother got married and separated from the parents, she was involved in household and farming work.  After finishing school, Gulzada was accepted to a university and came back to her native village after her graduation, where she got married.  Her oldest daughter was born in 1990 and then three sons.  The family needs increased with its growing size.  In order to feed and provide her children with all necessities, Gulzada started to go to a market to sell vegetables and fruits.  Parallel to this, Gulzada and her husband have already started their own business of breeding livestock by initially buying a dairy cow for producing milk.  With this successful start, Gulzada was able to buy bulls, and the business grew due to the addition of offspring.  With time, having sold some of the livestock, Gulzada was able to buy a house and a car for her family.  At the present time, she and her husband are fully involved in animal husbandry.  Today, their business contains three bulls and two rams.  In order to further develop her business, Gulzada requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  Gulzada's oldest daughter is attending a Police School, and Gulzada's plans are to increase livestock headcount in order to be able to educate her younger sons as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1132275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alekseevka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10034.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339276},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095631},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-26T09:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329935},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938709},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071184},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459606},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012375},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754744},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-27T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5017.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458751},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862885}],"funded_date":"2012-08-04T17:53:33Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":447105,"name":"Xumar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Xumar is a 40-year-old woman.

Thanks to Shamiykul's hard work, today her business contains nine cows with offspring and nineteen sheep, and the sales of milk yield about 15,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Shamiykul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.

From 2005 to 2011, lacking any source of income, Gulkaiyr and her husband were forced to go to find work in Russia, where Gulkaiyr took any available job. Thanks to their hard work, the couple were able to save up enough money to return to their homeland. Upon arrival, Gulkaiyr bought a house and 10 sheep for fattening and resale, and found a job at a local school. Presently, she works as a history teacher while awaiting the birth of her third child. Her herd presently consists of 38 sheep, and sales of meat bring roughly 8,000 som per month.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Gulkaiyr has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase clover. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her herd."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1132525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fodder for her sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kaiyndy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulkaiyr","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20093.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095635},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":20093.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938712}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T12:07:46Z","paid_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":447101,"name":"Nigar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nigar is a 43-year-old widow and raises two daughters alone.

In order to further develop her business, Cholpon requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.

She is a kind, responsible, and hardworking woman.  She married 41-year-old Humberto 18 years ago and together they have four children who are still their dependents.  Their ages are 18, 15, 12, and 7.  She lives in the home she was able to build with her husband thanks to the effort they each put into their work.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling groceries.  Every day, starting very early, she opens her store doors to serve all the customers who come to her business looking for products, knowing that they will find what they need.  Her store is the best stocked in the neighborhood and, in addition to that, her customers do not hesitate to buy from her because of the quality brands she offers and her wonderful customer service.  She remembers that when she started this business she did not have many products to offer and so she was not able to make good sales during the day.  This often discouraged her, but she nevertheless sought a solution; she saved up a small amount of capital and, little by little, she stocked her small store.  Now her sales are very good and 15 years of hard work have passed since then.  What she likes most about her work is sharing happy moments with her customers, talking with them, and seeing them start their days with a smile.  She finds that the hardest part is having to get up early to work in her store, but even when she feels tired, she knows that it is her job and she has to do it.  She hopes that her business will grow in the future and make her better income.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that since she discovered this microfinancier five years ago she has had financial support.  That is why she promises, once again, to make her payments on time, as she has with her previous loans.  She is also very happy to belong to her communal bank, as all of its members are very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,000 nuevos soles to buy a greater variety of products with which she will stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1119780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, sugar, milk, etc. to stock her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":310.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":302.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":330.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":342.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":348.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":365.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.89,"local_amount":613.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":613.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401977},{"amount":123.85,"local_amount":330.27,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":330.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456252},{"amount":128.47,"local_amount":342.59,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":342.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451916},{"amount":130.71,"local_amount":348.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":348.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447091},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":365.54,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":365.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052997}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T23:13:16Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":445270,"name":"Katya Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Srta.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives with her husband Jhony and together they have four children, whom she cares for very lovingly. She owns her house, which is located in the town of Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez.\r\nIn the mornings she sells candy in on of her town's schools. She uses a tricycle in the schoolyard of that institution. She's already been in this business for two years and, according to her, it's going very well, since she always sells an average of 70 nuevos soles. From that amount she needs to draw the expenses invested in merchandise as well as the daily payment to the school for the right to sell. In addition, her husband works in a farm cutting pasture for the animals, and he receives a monthly salary for that. However, on Saturdays and Sundays he drives the three-wheeler they purchased a few years ago and transports passengers, which gets them some extra money for the household. Now they need to repair their vehicle in order to keep working as usual.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she gives thanks for the support she's gotten.

He lives in the city of Pisco and has 2 children who have been his motivation and reason to press forward and struggle so that they become good men. Unfortunately for various reasons he separated from his wife some years ago. Alejandro has always been a very happy, hard-working and enthusiastic person. Sadly, when he was very young he lost his parents. Since then, due to the need of work and to afford his expenses he could not pursue a professional career, but he would have liked to study mechanical engineering. In his free time he likes to dedicate a little time to sports and on some occasions cook a delicious rice with duck to share with his family.\r\n\r\nThanks to his entrepreneurial spirit and good lessons from his father, Alejandro for some years has run his small garage painting cars. He works about 11 hours daily, during which he can attend to up to 5 customers. Alejandro is very happy doing his work and believes that his business is doing well due to his clients recommending him for his good work and for his kind and respectful treatment.\r\n\r\nAlejandro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the help provided he will be able to purchase welding and renovation materials such as: paint, paint gun, sand paper, paint thinner, varnishes among others. In this way, Alejandro would have his business better conditioned with adequate materials to do his jobs. In this way he will be able to increase his sales and economic income, with which he wants to be able to give his housing the finishes it requires and in the not too distant future he hopes to be able to have another shop for painting cars that he can manage.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1131875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials welding and renovation materials such as: paint, paint gun, sand paper, paint thinner, varnishes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro Nicanor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":203.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":207.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":215.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":227.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":232.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":244.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":251.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":275.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":282.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":293.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":304.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Yamaoka","image":784416}},{"id":447193,"name":"Kwekwe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kwekwe is 34 years old and lives in the town of Tiribe in the Kenyan coastal region of Kenya.

Through this work she will generate resources in order to support her family, as she is married and has 4 children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she like about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1131872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeraldin Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14141.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1414.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":615,"local_amount":4242.42,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441325},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495264},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260808},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490518},{"amount":205,"local_amount":1414.14,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095377}],"funded_date":"2012-07-13T00:38:30Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Yamaoka","image":784416}},{"id":447209,"name":"Deo-Gracias 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Solange, age 44, is married with 4 children, ages 8 to 22 years old.

She greatly enjoys tending to her clients, so she decided to open her own tailoring shop. She is now requesting a loan for the purchase of clothing materials and thread. These are the items that she uses the most in her tailoring.\n\nMwanashabani and her husband, Salim, are very grateful to the microfinance institution, because if things keep going as they have been, the quality of everything in the tailoring shop will increase. This makes them very happy, because their children will not have to go without education in the future. Currently, they live in their own house that has piped water but no electricity, though they hope to have this amenity very soon.

","en":"Ana is a humble woman who lives in Le\u00f3n. She is 47 years old and has two children. She is a Kiva client who, as a trader, has been selling tortillas since she was 26 years old.  Ana says that her first loan was a great help as she was able to invest in her business. In addition to the profit that she made, she succeeded in improving the conditions of her business premises. She used the loan to buy corn and firewood to make tortillas. However, she would like to diversify further in products offered by her business, as demand is high. That is why she now needs a loan, like the previous one, to buy corn and firewood for her business, because products are going up in price and she needs to be prepared for the rainy season. She considers that this new investment will help because she can buy the raw materials required for the business, and she will be able to meet the needs of her customers. Ana says that her next step is to buy zinc and corn to put aside for use during difficult times. She hopes to have the support of Kiva to allow her to continue with her work, since it is something that she loves doing and that has enabled her to get on in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1131882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and firewood.

","en":"The borrower Pendeza is the secretary of the loan group B\u00e9n\u00e9diction.  A dynamic woman, she is on her 15th loan cycle.  She is the mother of seven children.  Her husband is currently unemployed.  She sells various items.  She started her business with money that her husband gave her.  She makes her sales at the public market in the Alanine sector.  She has been earning money with this type of work for about eight years.   With money from the IMF Hekima loan, this borrower hopes to increase her turnover by stocking up on various items (Omo detergent, sugar, gasoline, cosmetic lotions, Fanta, shoes, etc.).  She says that presently, the challenge in this type of work is the amount of taxes.  In the future, she hopes to grow her business, improve the comfort of her home, educate her children, and see that her husband finds work.  She would like to thank IMF Hekima for the regular loans that she receives without any collateral.  It is because of these loans that she is able to meet the many needs of her family. \r\n\u2003\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":533809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various items such as Omo detergent, sugar, gasoline, cosmetic lotions, Fanta, shoes, etc.  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Before this, he used to work as a driver. All of his children moved out from their parent\u2019s house. Now he lives with his wife and nephew in Kherlen, an eastern boundary town in Mongolia. One of his daughters lives in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Recently, his daughter purchased a plot of land and an old house in the 'ger' district (ger is a Mongolian nomadic tent).  The house needed a complete renovation or repair. Especially, she is planning to replace its windows to double-glazed ones first due to too much heat loss and emissions through the old ones.  But she lacks money to cover the cost of new windows. \n\nHer father Beezandan decided to help his daughter to repair her home. She believes her house will become warmer and the cost of coal will be cut notably. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is a main reason of Mongolia's air pollution. \n\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and to buy the cars running on natural gas. The loan Beezandan is taking will be used to cover the cost of the new double-glazed windows for his daughter\u2019s house.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Gemma buys products at wholesale prices and sells them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She brings in a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory, and to service her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWeldita hopes to expand her business through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. She can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as they study together.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1134857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to farmers as a high-risk proposition because their profitability is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations.

repair. He works as a vendor in a local store, and is requesting a loan to repair his home, which is located in the ger (or traditional Mongolian yurt) district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. He will use his loan to buy the materials he needs to replace his home's heater, old wooden floor and windows, and install insulation to reduce heat loss. In the winter, he uses a water-heated furnace to stay warm, and it costs too much and wastes a lot of water. By replacing it, he will lower his bills and improve the environment. \r\n  \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the globe's most polluted countries. This is due to the long, cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities, and it frequently snows. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from people just trying to stay warm. Extremely toxic smoke from cars is another cause of air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to its clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and run cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and on Mongolians' health.
