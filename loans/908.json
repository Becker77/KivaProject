They both live with their parents at their house, which is located in a very beautiful place. His father is the one who takes on the family's responsibilities. In order to help him, Mohammad works really hard and non-stop. He started his own business in 2008. His job consists of installing sound systems for cars, houses, etc. As he seeks to gain additional income, Mohammad has requested a youth loan from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to purchase more sound system equipment.

He previously worked as a fireman in the emergency bureau for many years, but he decided to start his business due to the low salary. His wife is unemployed and she stays at home. His business has been a main income source of his family for years. Sometimes he has no jobs for many days; this is very bad for his business and family, so he wants to run a taxi when his work stops. He plans to buy a car which runs on natural gas. He totally cares about environmental issues, especially air pollution. Now he needs MNT 1,950,000 to cover the remaining cost of purchasing his car. \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Also, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and allows them to buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will be used to cover the cost of purchasing a natural gas-engine car. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1134941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Green"],"use":"to cover the cost of purchasing a natural gas-engine car.

Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He runs a small construction company and has been working since 2009. He hires a few builders and pays their benefits from his profits as he can. His company has done many external and internal building jobs since it was established 3 years ago. \r\nHis renting apartment is bad, small, and uncomfortable, so he has decided to build his family a house in the ger district (a ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) in the city area. It will have a foam insulation wall. He thinks this will reduce the heat loss and emissions and won\u2019t use much coal fuel.  Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Also, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main causes of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and enables them to buy cars which run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Batsuren is taking will used to buy wall insulation materials such as the foam boards, rock wool, and bricks. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1134944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy wall insulation materials such as foam boards, rock wool, and bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batsuren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1165666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1190338.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1235839.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1408156.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":880.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":898.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":933.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1063.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":880.08,"local_amount":1165666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1169184.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369485},{"amount":2894.92,"local_amount":3834333.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3845903.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129251}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T08:21:11Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":446794,"name":"Katerina","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410. \u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430. \n\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 9 000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b: 50 \u043f\u0430\u0440 \u0448\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432, 70 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a. \n","en":"This is not Katerina's first time using Kiva's lending services.

It comprises nine members and is run by a board of directors. Candelaria is the board President. The members of this communal bank have several types of businesses, such as selling potatoes and chu\u00f1o (a traditional freeze-dried potato product), making traditional sweaters, selling clothing, selling cell phones and technology, selling salchipapas (a sausage and potato dish), shoe repair, selling shoes, a neighborhood store, and a coffee-shop stall.\r\n\r\nCandelaria says she joined Pro Mujer two years ago through her sister-in-law, who invited her. She currently has a business selling potatoes and  chu\u00f1o. She says she started this business because she didn't have any money and she wanted to help her husband generate resources by selling regional products.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is now requesting will be used to increase capital (to purchase potatoes and chu\u00f1o). She will buy from the rural areas and later sell at the traditional markets in the city of El Alto. This line of work allows her to generate resources in order to support her family as best she can, since she is in a common-law marriage and has four children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says it is the health trainings and the loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1132686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase potatoes and chu\u00f1o.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constancia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aydee\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27240.92,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2270.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1308.35,"local_amount":9080.4,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9119.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495268},{"amount":654.17,"local_amount":4540.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4559.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260812},{"amount":654.17,"local_amount":4540.2,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4559.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490522},{"amount":654.18,"local_amount":4540.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4559.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095381},{"amount":654.13,"local_amount":4539.92,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4559.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235459}],"funded_date":"2012-08-04T18:24:39Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:43:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":446128,"name":"Alejandro Gabino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro es un hombre de 33 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo por salir adelante y ayudar a sus padres, a quienes desea retribuirles todos sus cuidados y apoyo brindado;

","en":"Luz Mery is 45 years old and owns a multi-service business.  This allows her to support her household which consists of her husband, who is also an entrepreneur, and their children who are 24 and 19 years old.  She dreams of seeing her children become successful professionals.  Luz Mery started her business 10 years ago when a cosmetics consultant who sold products through specialized guides introduced her to her catalog and she started selling goods to a market consisting of neighbors, relatives and close friends.  Her efforts in promoting and selling her products, and recouping her investment, were very soon rewarded as her business grew.  She is now a product director and leads a group of more than 60 women who sell cosmetics, ladies' accessories and perfumes.  She has earned prizes and has invested a lot in the products that the catalog promotes with discounts.  As a result, five years ago she was able to buy a display case and shelving which she set up in her own home, turning it into a sales location.  Things have gone very well and she has managed to start selling additional products which she buys because her customers request them.\r\n\r\nWhen Luz Mery bought a computer for her family, her neighbors and customers would ask to borrow it or ask her to type letters and general memos.  She saw a potential for making income and added a transcription and photocopying service to her business.  This has also done very well and Luz Mery's biggest goal is now to grow her micro-business.  In order to achieve her goal, she gets up every morning and puts all her efforts into her work.  Her main challenge is not having enough working capital to invest in her business as she makes most of her sales on credit.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use her loan to buy a printer, a display case and general merchandise such as perfumes and cosmetics.  This investment will improve her income and she will gradually manage to fulfill her dream of seeing her son finish

She is requesting a loan in order to buy soft drinks and ingredients for preparing her dishes such as green chili peppers, dried chili peppers, onions, cheese, cold cuts, and oil.  One of her wishes is for all single mothers to value themselves and strive for their dreams.  She thanks Vision Fund for helping her with growing her business.    \r\n\r\nThe other group members are as follows:\r\n\u2022 Reyna sells bread.\r\n\u2022 Gabriela sells food\r\n\u2022 Marcelina Socorro sells cold cuts.\r\n\u2022 Maris Mavi sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022 Martha sells food.\r\n\u2022 Pabla sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022 Herma sells bread.\r\n\u2022 Bernarda sells cold cuts.  \r\n\u2022 Agueda sells Mexican street food.\r\n\u2022 Enedina sells groceries.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1116848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks and ingredients for preparing her dishes.

Xochilt is 38 years old and she has been selling plastic containers through a catalog for two and a half years.  Her business is the best thing that ever happened to her because she has been able to use her profits to enjoy a better quality of life.  Xochilt says that what she most likes about her business is going out to sell her merchandise and meet with her customers.  On the other hand, the biggest challenge she faces is that sometimes her customers don't have enough money to pay her for the merchandise that they have bought.  This means that Xochilt loses profits and time.  She decided to start this business in order to help her husband with their household expenses so that, between the two of them, they could offer their children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nXochilt believes herself to be a special person because she really enjoys improving herself and overcoming obstacles and barriers that she finds in her path.  When she is sad, she thinks of her value as a person and what her business means to her.  Xochilt says that when she sets herself a goal, she does her very best to achieve it.

Its twelve members are all women from a beautiful town called Pinotepa Nacional in Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Herminia, better known as Hino.  She is 66 years old and has been selling tamales, hand-made tortillas and 'sopes' (fried tortillas topped with beans and sauce) for 23 years.  She started working when she was very young because her parents didn't have too many financial opportunities and they didn't make enough income to feed her brothers and sisters.  Hino set out selling 'empanadas de leche' (plantain dumplings stuffed with milk pudding) and other sweet treats.  However, this didn't make her enough profits and so she decided to start selling hand-made tortillas.  This business proved profitable.  Over time, her customers started asking her to sell tamales as well.  Although Hino didn't know whether this typical Mexican dish would sell well, she took the risk as she has always liked to do.\r\n\r\nHino says that what she most enjoys about her business is making her tamales because she discovered that she makes them with good flavor.  She would like to make the most of this gift and keep working.  Above all, she would like to make the most of the opportunities that her customers give her to keep selling her products.  Her customers recommend her because of the service that she provides.  Despite the fact that she lost her husband 20 years ago and needed to work harder in order to feed her family, Hino says that it wasn't so difficult because she really enjoys working.  In addition, she says that she has always made the most of all the opportunities open to her.  In the past she has worked as a farm laborer and also as a fisherwoman in order to provide her three children with a good education.  Hino requested this loan to buy ingredients with which to make her tamales.  She also bought corn and logs.  Hino would like to send everybody a message: \"Make the most of all the opportunities that present themselves in life as they don't always appear\".\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nMar\u00eda Antonieta -

The city is one of the country's loveliest and best-known tourist spots and the home of one of its largest naval bases.  Its historic-artistic heritage has come down to the city from older ones--Carthage, Rome, Byzantium--and the old mixes beautifully with the new.  Yaleidis operates her restaurant business here, in this perfect place.  She makes and sells prepared meals, mostly for the day laborers, construction workers, etc. who work in the area.  She sells on credit and collects from her customer once a week.  She wants to improve the space where she works because she operates the business in her house and there's not enough room for both the business and her family.  She is applying for a loan because she doesn't have enough working capital to carry out the improvements.  Yaleidis will use your Kiva loan to buy the basic supplies--rice, cooking oil, flour, etc.--she needs to continue her business.  The investment will allow her to reduce her transportation costs and buy wholesale supplies of everything she needs at a lower cost than she would otherwise have to pay.

His sales will increase considerably, which will allow him to provide his family with a better quality of life and better financial opportunities for advancement.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a display case, a coffee maker, and other upgrades to improve the presentation of his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reinaldo Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89402},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91901},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94470},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97110},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99825},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102615},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105483},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108431},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111462},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114578},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117780},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121072},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124456},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127935},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131511},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135187},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138966},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142850},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146843},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150947},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155166},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159503},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163961},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168546}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":446172,"name":"Bererna Bernarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Berena de 41 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus dos hijos en las edades de 11 y 15 a\u00f1os, en la hermosa ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, lugar ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe,  uno de los sitios tur\u00edsticos mas hermosos de Colombia y muy reconocido, pues   tiene una de las principales bases navales del pa\u00eds y  por su patrimonio hist\u00f3rico-art\u00edstico, que abarca de vestigios de \u00e9poca cartaginesa, romana, bizantina, edificaciones de car\u00e1cter militar de \u00e9poca moderna y contempor\u00e1nea, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n edificios neocl\u00e1sicos y modernistas.

","en":"41-year-old Bererna lives with her spouse and her two children aged 11 and 15. They live in the charming town of Cartagena de Indias, a place located by the Caribbean sea. It's one of the most beautiful and well-known tourist sites in Colombia, because it has one of the most important naval bases in the country and also because of its historic and artistic heritage. This includes remains from the Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine periods, military buildings of the modern and contemporary age, as well as neoclassical and modernist buildings. This charming town is the setting where she leads a modest life and runs her business. It's a store where she sells stationery items, products for women and for the household, and various merchandise she gradually added according to her customers' demands. She's been building a clientele for the past three years, ever since she became unemployed and decided to start this business so she could get an income to contribute to the welfare of her household. At first she offered phone and cell phone calling services, and later on she added oats in glass jars, candy, pastries and industrially processed foodstuffs. Finally, she added stationery items, accessories, home products and everything else her customers demanded. Her business sense has steered her favorably, since she has taken very good advantage of the opportunities provided by the market. Her main customers are the students of the schools located near her business. Her goal is to keep on expanding her clientele, but her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital for that. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, which she will use to purchase stationery, school supplies, toiletries and herbal medicine. With this investment she intends to increase her sales potential and obtain new profits, which will very much help her achieve her dream of improving her family's well-being more and more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1132776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase stationery, school supplies, toiletries and herbal medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bererna Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72790},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82189},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86069},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88077},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90132},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92235},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94388},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96590},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98844},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101150},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113429}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":72790,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":73472.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395510},{"amount":46.7,"local_amount":82189,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":82959.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775296},{"amount":47.79,"local_amount":84107,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84895.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519360},{"amount":489.15,"local_amount":860914,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":868985.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928018}],"funded_date":"2012-08-09T23:23:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":446179,"name":"Nestor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nestor es una persona muy trabajadora que siempre se ha caracterizado por querer dar en su familia una mejor calidad de vida y progresar econ\u00f3micamente, para esto trabaja fuertemente en su negocio desde hace 8 a\u00f1os el cual es la fotograf\u00eda y donde ofrece a sus clientes los servicios de primeras comuniones, matrimonios, eventos especiales, entre otros m\u00e1s.

For an income to pay for his family\u2019s expenses he has a hut where he sells sweets and ice cream, and thanks to this his family can enjoy a good quality of life.  Carlos started to work when he was very young and because of all the experience that he has acquired, he has been able to better know his customers, how to sell, and thus to have a good business.  Since he came from a poor family, it\u2019s been difficult for him to get ahead on his own since he had to help support his family, but now that he is married and has his own children, his financial situation has improved a little.  This has allowed him to have a better quality of life.  Thanks to his great effort, his sales have been increasing and that is why he is asking for a loan to buy sweets, snacks, ice cream and other products that have been selling out.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1132796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweets, snacks, ice cream and other products that have been selling out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T02:10:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28514},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29312},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30131},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30973},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31839},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32729},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33643},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34584},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35550},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36544},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37566},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38615}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":17.82,"local_amount":28514,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":31659.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433252},{"amount":17.18,"local_amount":27489,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":30521.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617668},{"amount":18.72,"local_amount":29957,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":33261.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640589},{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":32970,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":36607.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029689},{"amount":18.63,"local_amount":29800,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":33087.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165777},{"amount":21.73,"local_amount":34768,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":38603.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548325},{"amount":19.17,"local_amount":30671,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":34054.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098234},{"amount":0.53,"local_amount":841,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":933.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517496},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":70502,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":78279.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364551730},{"amount":71.55,"local_amount":114488,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":127117.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164157}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T08:55:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T08:57:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":447838,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marivic, 34, a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines.

She is married and the mother of three children.  Her husband is Menardo, who is an electrician.  Together with her husband and children, Wilma manages their household while operating a variety store. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one packet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Wilma makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 39,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes her business would grow into a mini-grocery, and she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of theiir work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1049709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy various grocery items to expand her inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T02:50:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5564.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303415},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5566.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356140},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4451.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114240},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350294}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T14:06:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":447844,"name":"Sreul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married mother of seven children, Sreul is 62 years old and living in a rural village of the Dambae district in Cambodia.

For four years he has been in this business, and he has gained experience during this time. Now he lives with his wife and his two children in the ger district (ger is a Mongolian nomadic traditional yurt) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe bought his plot of land in 2008 after his family moved in the city. Since then, he has been building his family's house. But it still is not finished yet, and there isn't enough money to cover the cost of the building materials for installing insulated windows, flooring and wall insulation. He needs cement, rock wool and foam to make them. He plans to have a well-insulated house which does not have any heat loss or emissions during the winter. In Mongolia, heat loss and emissions are big issues around the households in ger district. It is very harmful for your health and money. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in the winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons why Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Mr. Lkhagvasuren is taking will be used to buy insulation materials to build his new family home.

She has faced the problem of inadequate capital to start a business and low income to sustain the family, with an inability to provide good clothing, a balanced diet, proper education and health care. Because of the above problems she hopes and wishes to receive this loan amount to improve the family situation. She prefers this loan because of the convenient prepayment period, low interest and business\/life skill education provided by GHAPE.\r\n\r\nShe intends to buy three bags of rice, groundnuts, oil, beans, cartons of soap, and two tons of fuel wood and invest the rest in farming. This loan use will serve the community in that it will assist so many people so that they will have goods available on short notice to the community as well as cosmetics products. The profits of this loan will be used to improve the standard of living within her family as better education, health care and nutrition will be offered to them. The rest will be ploughed back into the medicine\/cosmetics store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1136114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for bags of rice, groundnuts, oil, beans, cartons of soap, and two tons of fuel wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

This is where Bernardo lives modestly and runs a business renting washing machines.  He started the business to help housewives who were using a baseball bat to beat the clothing to get it clean, working under the hot sun of the Caribbean, making it even more difficult.  So he bought his first washing machine and helped his wife with this chore, and little by little he bought even more machines to rent to his neighbors.\r\n\r\nBernardo is also a bricklayer, brining in extra income to put toward his goal of living a better lifestyle.  He is requesting a CrediKiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, so he can buy two washing machines and also renovate his house by installing a banister along the stairway and putting up metal railing on the balcony.  With this investment he will be able to increase his income somewhat and give his home the safety it requires, giving him tranquility and the guarantee of offering quality service and corporate image in his business, also beneficial for the family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy two washing machines and renovate his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73646},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82209},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84127},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86090},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88099},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90154},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92258},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94411},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96614},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98868},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101175},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":112349}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":446198,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"To hire workers and buy new plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T10:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T10:40:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12001.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810636}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T13:50:06Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":446201,"name":"Rnald","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ronald de 30 a\u00f1os, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hijo  de 3 a\u00f1os de edad , en la hermosa ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, lugar ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe,  uno de los sitios tur\u00edsticos mas hermosos de Colombia y muy reconocido, pues   tiene una de las principales bases navales del pa\u00eds y  por su patrimonio hist\u00f3rico-art\u00edstico, que abarca de vestigios de \u00e9poca cartaginesa, romana, bizantina, edificaciones de car\u00e1cter militar de \u00e9poca moderna y contempor\u00e1nea, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n edificios neocl\u00e1sicos y modernistas.

However, she has always had the strength to keep going and continue making progress together with her children.  She and her ex-husband set up a stationery store ten years ago through which they made income for their household and covered their expenses.  However, five years ago her ex-husband left home.  Cielo was then left in charge of all the household expenses and so she had to improve her income in order to have enough money to provide her three children with a better quality of life.  She started selling hardware products as well as stationery products, taking advantage of the rise in construction work in her area.  Now, thanks to her hardware sales, she has managed to provide her children with access to a better quality education and her household has better financial opportunities for making progress.  Her biggest dream is to provide her children with access to a university education and so she is looking to increase her sales.  She is requesting a loan so that she can buy stationery and hardware products that she does not currently sell in her business so that she can offer her customers a wider range of products and increase her sales.  This will enable her to make better income for her household and her children will have the opportunity to enjoy a university education which will allow them to make progress in life.  Cielo's dream is to have larger premises for her business where she can arrange everything better and where she can create jobs for people who need them most."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery and hardware products that she currently doesn't sell in her business so that she can offer her customers more products and increase her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Envigado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T11:30:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cielo Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":52194},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53654},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55155},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56698},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":58284},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":59914},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":61590},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":63313},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65084},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66905},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68777},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70701},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72679},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74712},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76802},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78951},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":81159},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83428}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":447933,"name":"Roquesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roquesa works hard to support her family.

This activity will succeed because of the ever-growing demand  for wood to use as fuel in the urban town of Bamenda, high demand for poultry products and also pork from within and without Bamenda. Again the high influx of people into the city of Bamenda warrants many mouths to feed, thus the need also for more farming activity, the reason why she is also in farming. Moreover, the by-products of the fowls and pigs will be used as fertilizer in her farm thus reducing cost of buying fertilizer.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Todo esto con el fin de generar ingresos, para lograr el sostenimiento de su familia; poco a poco su negocio fue creciendo,  pues como buen observador, identific\u00f3 un gran potencial de transe\u00fantes, que pudieran ser parte de su clientela como con el tiempo lo logr\u00f3 y para ellos agreg\u00f3 dulcer\u00eda, productos comestibles y bebidas con los que gan\u00f3 dinero, ahorr\u00f3 y se traslad\u00f3 a su casa, donde  ubic\u00f3  dos mesas con vitrinas y aprovechando la nueva nevera familiar, agreg\u00f3 refrescos y bebidas. Hoy est\u00e1 muy entusiasmado con ese cambio y con su disciplina de ahorro, compr\u00f3 un enfriador,  ya que la nevera familiar no respond\u00eda a su crecimiento. En la actualidad adem\u00e1s de todos los anteriores productos, tambi\u00e9n vende l\u00e1cteos y calzado, adem\u00e1s de mercanc\u00edas variadas, que va registrando en los pedidos   de su clientela. En la medida en que ha ido creciendo el negocio de Wilson,  su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente,  para responder a la demanda del mercado, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres, abarrotes, estanter\u00eda met\u00e1lica, para ira asimilando su negocio a una tienda, donde comercialice los productos de la canasta familiar, que son de alto consumo entre su potencial clientela. As\u00ed mismo adecuar\u00e1 el techo en la terraza de su casa, para proteger a su clientela del incesante sol del caribe y bajar la temperatura del lugar donde ella trabaja, proporcion\u00e1ndole   un poco de sombra a su negocio y con ello proporcionar un mejor estar a todos.  ","en":"Wilson, age 50, lives with his wife and two children, ages 3 and 17.  They live in the beautiful city of Cartagena, which is located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea.  It is one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nIt is in this fantastic place that he has his own modest telecommunications business.  He also sells beer, soft drinks, sweets, candies, and processed foods there.  He started his business two years ago when he started to sell cell phone services beneath the shade of a tree that is close to his house.\r\nHe does all of this in order to generate income to support his family.  Little by little his business has been growing.  As a good observer, he identified a great potential from passers-by who could be part of his clientele.  In time he achieved that, and he added candy, food, and drinks for his customers.  He earned money from them, saved, and moved to his house.  He set up two tables with display cases.  He took advantage of the family refrigerator and added soda and drinks.\r\n\r\nHe is now very enthusiastic about this change. He saved with discipline, and he bought a cooler because the family refrigerator could not keep up with his growth.  In addition to all of the previous products, he now sells dairy products, shoes, and various merchandise ordered by his customers.\r\n\r\nAs long as Wilson\u2019s business has been growing, he has not had enough working capital to respond to the market demand.  That is the reason that he turns to a Kiva loan, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy supplies, groceries, and a metal shelf in order to adapt his business to become a store.  In the store he will sells basic needs products that are consumed a lot by his potential clientele.\r\n\r\nHe will also fix the roof of the terrace of his house in order to protect his customers from the incessant Caribean sun and to lower the temperature of the place where he works.  This will provide a bit of shade for his business, which will improve everyone's well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies, groceries, and a metal shelf, and to  adapt the roof of his terrace.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147371},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":170721},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":174704},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":178781},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":182952},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":187221},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":191590},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":196060},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200635},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":205316},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":210107},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":215010},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":220027},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225161},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":230414},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":263930}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":448009,"name":"Marie Josee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie Josee is married with one child who is 22 years old.

As\u00ed fue como empez\u00f3 la tienda, pues esta pareja,  deseaba gestionar ingresos suficientes, que beneficiaran a su familia,  primero vendiendo unos  pocos productos y adicionando cada vez mas otros nuevos,  hasta lograr diversificar  como hasta hoy lo han logrado, porque tambi\u00e9n ofrecen mercanc\u00eda a trav\u00e9s de gu\u00edas especializadas, especialmente productos de belleza. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para implementar una estrategia mercadol\u00f3gica, que le permita impactar con precios, promociones y productos, que sus clientes piden constantemente y muchas veces su negocio no soporta esta rotaci\u00f3n, dejando insatisfechos a otros. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acuden a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1n v\u00edveres, abarrotes, c\u00e1rnicos, enlatados, l\u00e1cteos y productos de belleza que ofrece su revista con descuentos especiales. Con esta inversi\u00f3n planea aumentar sus ingresos, ofreciendo a buenos precios de productos, resultado del traslado de los precios de oportunidad con el que Melida accede al mercado al comprarle en mayor cantidad.","en":"Melida, 44, lives with her husband and four children whose ages range from 6 to 24 years in the city of Cartagena, located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nIn that fantastic place in a modest way she runs her grocery, soft-drinks, beverage, snacks, foodstuffs and canned goods store.  She also sells stationery supplies, cosmetics and women\u2019s accessories as well as other merchandise that sells well and complements the main products she retails increasing her income and helping her capital to turnover frequently.\r\n\r\nWhen Melida decided to develop her enterprising, independent idea she did it after an experience she had with her husband.  They lost the jobs they had at a leather processing firm and decided to apply the useful skills they had in sales to start their own business venture and generate their own independent employment.  This is how the store started out because this couple wanted to generate sufficient income to benefit their family.\r\n\r\nAt first they sold just a few products adding more new ones every time until they attained the diversity they now have because they also offer merchandise via catalogue especially beauty products.  Her greatest challenge is not having sufficient capital to implement a marketing strategy that will allow her to impress with her prices, special promotions and products her customers constantly request and often are unavailable in stock thus leaving some demand unmet.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why they are calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing they get from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo through which they will buy foodstuffs, groceries, meats, canned goods, dairy products and beauty products that are on special in her catalogue.  With this investment she plans to increase income offering products at good prices resulting from her passing down to her customers the special prices Melida gets by being able to buy in quantity.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122019},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":138866},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":142106},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145422},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":148815},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":152288},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155841},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":159477},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":163198},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167006},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170903},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":174891},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178972},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183148},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":187421},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":191794},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":196270},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":221563}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":446182,"name":"Libia Ines","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Libia se encuentra casada y tiene 9 hijos a quienes siempre les ha querido brindar una buena calidad de vida y para esto tiene un negocio con el cual genera los ingresos para su hogar y contribuye econ\u00f3micamente junto con su esposo para que en su familia puedan tener una buena calidad de vida.

Las mercanc\u00edas variadas las venden a cr\u00e9dito y las ofrece a su clientela mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos, pues se afili\u00f3 a una empresa que le proporciona esta forma de hacer negocio y los deditos empanaditas y otros congelados los hace por encargos mediante una preventa a casa de eventos, familiares, vecinos y referidos de sus clientes. Su meta mas adelante,  es aumentar sus ingresos suficientemente para lograr adquirir su propia casa y planearle un futuro prometedor a su hijo. En la actualidad su capital de trabajo es su mayor desaf\u00edo, porque debe esperar recoger el dinero de los cr\u00e9ditos otorgados a sus clientes, para volver a comprar, mientras sus clientes necesitan una respuesta inmediata para volver a solicitarle los productos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanicas variadas y  harina de trigo en mayor volumen  ya que debe responder a pedidos de congelados de manera oportuna para poder crecer y esto es justamente lo que lograr\u00e1 con su credikiva.    ","en":"Mayrlim, 26, lives with her spouse and ten-month-old son in the city of Cartagena, located on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, one of Colombia\u2019s best-known tourist sites because it has one of the country\u2019s main naval bases and its historical-artistic heritage encompasses Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine military styles from both modern and contemporary ages as well as neo-classical and modern buildings.\r\n\r\nThere in that fantastic place in a modest way she has her two businesses.  One is selling assorted merchandise like jeans and the other one produces extra income.  In the latter she makes items from wheat flour or frozen treats like turnovers and cheese pastries, among others.\r\n\r\nShe was studying to be a nursery school teacher but when she formed her family and was expecting her first child she had to drop out of the university and find a way to generate income which is how she became a merchant.  She availed herself of her mother-in-law\u2019s skills who taught her to make frozen treats in order to help support her new home\u2019s wellbeing.  She sells the various merchandises on credit and offers them to her customers via specialized product catalogues since she became affiliated with a firm that makes it possible for her to be part of this type of business.  The baked goods and frozen treats she does based on prior orders at events sites, from family members, neighbors or referred customers.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to significantly increase her income in order to buy a house of her own and plan a promising future for her son.  Currently, her greatest challenge is working capital because in order to buy more she has to wait to collect payment from her credit customers and her other customers need immediate response to their requests if they are going to reorder from her.  \r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy varied merchandise and wheat flour in large amounts so that she can respond to orders for frozen treats in an opportune way in order to grow which we at the Fundaci\u00f3n think is precisely what she\u2019ll accomplish with her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy assorted merchandise and wheat flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T17:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T17:10:18Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayrlim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":74501},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82229},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84147},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86111},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88120},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90176},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92280},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94433},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96637},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98892},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101199},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":446239,"name":"Lucia Wilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

His wife is a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for one year. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to make savings and expand his cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The profit has been okay according to him, yet having to pay tuition fees and supporting all his family financially has not been easy at all for him. \r\n\r\nEvery time he tried to put some money aside to buy cows, something else came up that was urgent.

He remains focused on accumulating his income by using loans which Juhudi Kilimo has made accessible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1136284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to construct a dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T21:20:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwaniki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":2207,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2314.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294600246},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":2265.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2375.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301435622},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":2325.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308435858},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":2386.68,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315824387},{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":2449.77,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2568.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323032091},{"amount":31.43,"local_amount":2514.53,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2636.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331168044},{"amount":32.26,"local_amount":2580.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2706.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339550746},{"amount":67.11,"local_amount":5368.46,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5628.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355845662},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":2791.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2926.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768043},{"amount":35.81,"local_amount":2864.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3003.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516128},{"amount":28.07,"local_amount":2245.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381959784}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T08:14:32Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morgan Kelley","image":null}},{"id":448050,"name":"Abdusamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdusamad is very kind, clever, cute, and hardworking.
