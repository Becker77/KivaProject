He lives in the town of Ica, in the district of Parcona, with his beloved partner and their two small children. Brando is a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person, who devotes all his efforts to getting his family ahead. Unfortunately, due to his need to work and pay for his family's expenses, he couldn't pursue a professional career, but he would have liked to have studied for a career in business administration. In his free time, he enjoys playing soccer with his little ones and sometimes he cooks a delicious \"arroz con pollo\" (chicken and rice) that he shares with his family.\r\nOn his own initiative and thanks to the support he gets from his partner, Brando has worked as a motorcycle taxi driver for many years. He has a vehicle of his own, which he purchased with a lot of effort by saving money from previous jobs. Brando works approximately 10 hours a day and he's able to serve an average of 40 customers. He feels comfortable in his work and believes that his business does well because of his friendly, respectful manners.\r\nBrando is very thankful to Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he'll be able to do maintenance and renovations on his vehicle. He needs to fix the engine in his motorcycle taxi, since it consumes a lot of gasoline. That way Brando will have a vehicle in good condition and provide a better service. He'll increase his profits, which later on he'll use to purchase a car in order to work with it in providing taxi services. By doing that he wishes to achieve his biggest dream of being able to ensure his little children's future and well-being."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1132985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to do maintenance and renovations on his vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brando Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":92.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":104.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":111.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":113.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":118.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":123.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":446288,"name":"Jesus Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas es padre de familia y tiene dos hijos bajo su responsabilidad y quienes ya est\u00e1n estudiando la universidad.\nJes\u00fas tiene su negocio de venta de ropa usada a fuera de su vivienda quien lo atiende es el y su esposa la se\u00f1ora Rebeca quien le ayudad cuando el tiene que ir a trabajar en la compa\u00f1\u00eda de seguridad publica y se encarga del cuidado de sus hijos.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to grow and expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a teacher at a secondary school and has been working for five years nonstop. \r\n\r\nHer rental apartment has too much heat loss and emissions in the winter. She uses the furnace, which uses coal, just to stay warm at home. Her son always has flu due to the cold. So she wanted to make repairs to her apartment. She is planning to insulate the windows and the wall corners. She will recover some broken and bad parts of the walls with cement and foam. It will reduce the heat loss, and she will pay less for coal. Using the coal is very harmful for her family's health and the environment, as she knows.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars that run on the natural gas. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buying some building and insulation materials for her home repair. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1136974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy some building and insulation materials for her home repair.

is Rebecca who previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. Her earnings were a big help for her grandchild's education and for their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n \r\nRebecca would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in her store the better as more items to sell will result in better profits. Rebecca's business profits will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and her grandchild's educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nRebecca hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes her grandchild will finish schooling.

Como le ha ido bien desde hace 3 a\u00f1os hace sus pedidos directamente a la revista y no necesita intermediarios, porque su negocio ha crecido; en su negocio ha tenido la oportunidad de conocer a mucha gente, que tambi\u00e9n le solicitan otros productos que no tiene su catalogo y por eso compra a proveedores independientes y ha logrado con ellos establecer buenas relaciones comerciales, compr\u00e1ndole ropa, bolsos, calzado etc. En sus transacciones pide el 50% cuando entrega el producto y el saldo lo recupera en 15 d\u00edas, posteriores a esa fecha. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, pues conoci\u00f3 de esta organizaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de su amiga en el municipio. Este es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 bolsos, ropa, accesorios femeninos, porque tiene encargos que han realizado sus clientes y desea tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para responderles, comprando con descuentos para ofrecerles un buen precio y fidelizarlos. ","en":"Adalgisa, 53 years old, is a married woman with three children who are between 25 and 35 years old. She lives with her family in Malambo, located on the west bank of the Magdalena River. This is one of five towns that form the metropolitan area of Barranquilla, a city about 20 minutes away. There, Adalgisa makes a living by selling various merchandise, especially cosmetic products, which she promotes through specialized guides. She is a member of a business that supplies her catalog to sell her items. Initially, she began helping her friends to sell and six years ago, when she had a good experience, she decided to generate her own family income by making a living through this commercial activity.\r\n\r\nSince she has been doing well for three years, she makes her orders directly to the magazine and does not need intermediaries because her business has grown. Adalgisa has had the opportunity to meet many people through her business, whom also request other products that she doesn't have in her catalog. Therefore, she buys them from independent service providers and has been able to establish good business relationships by buying clothes, bags, shoes, etc. In transactions, she asks for 50% of the total when she delivers the product and the balance is paid 15 days later. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan. She learned about this organization through a friend in town. This is her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan, she will buy bags, clothes, and women's accessories because she has advance orders made by her clients. She also wants to have sufficient working capital to complete these orders by discount shopping so she can offer a good price and have loyal customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1133686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags, clothes, and women's accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adalgisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67220},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70655},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72304},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73991},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75718},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77484},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79292},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.21,"local_amount":67220,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":69718.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395519},{"amount":41.22,"local_amount":70655,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":73281.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775303},{"amount":269.57,"local_amount":462125,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":479300.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364528009}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T10:46:17Z","paid_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":448468,"name":"Msakuzi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rofina, who is in her late 30s, is married with three children who are still going to school.

In the future, Mrs. Afi would like to add the sale of bazins (traditional articles of clothing) and to ensure her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1137461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy pagnes (colorful African cloth) and ladies' purses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Adidogom\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23004},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23349},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23699},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":24055},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24416},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24782},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25154},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25531},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25914},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26303},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26697},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27096}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.16,"local_amount":23560,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":24096.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294469614},{"amount":49.64,"local_amount":25900,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26489.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301523351},{"amount":50.31,"local_amount":26250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26847.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308696075},{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":26600,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":27205.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315520567},{"amount":46.54,"local_amount":24280,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":24832.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323761265},{"amount":53.07,"local_amount":27690,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":28320.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331721852},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":28060,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-27T09:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":28698.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339644763},{"amount":50.68,"local_amount":26440,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":27042.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347200872},{"amount":54.91,"local_amount":28650,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29302.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364664849},{"amount":119.93,"local_amount":62570,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63994.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373050117}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T14:16:50Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":448508,"name":"Nino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nino is 39 years old.

Her husband, Manuel, is a taxi driver who offers a private, on-call service in the local area; they have 2 children together who are at public school. Maria started the business because her husband's work did not cover the family expenses, so she decided to hire a unit on a large plot of land. It has been a year since then and she has many regular customers. At the moment, she doesn't have any help so she does all the preparation and serving herself. She opens for a half day from 7:30am for breakfasts until 3:00pm for lunches. She will use this loan to buy produce for preparing meals.

She has been running a reinforced carton dividers business for more than 10 years, in which many important companies pay her for labor charges as Carmen and her family of 7 children carry out the work and earn money for doing so. She also runs a cafe selling soft and alcoholic drinks on the weekends, and she also hires out washing machines for a day at a time. Within her home, she lives and breathes the concept of 'work to earn' and that is the impression received by everybody who visits the home of this hardworking 60 year old woman. Although she has never studied much, as a widowed head of her household she has succeeded in helping her children to make good progress and in maintaining  a constant income to ensure their well-being. Carmen has a refrigerator and a music player to create a good atmosphere for those who come to drink beer at her home. All of her businesses are successful as she has the same customers for each, and she uses one business to promote her others. Recently, 2 of her 3 washing machines developed technical faults and she needs to repair them in order to continue offering this service. Consequently, she is applying for a loan - her first - from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which she will use to buy 3 washing machines and to repair the 2 requiring maintenance. Her strong client base, her effective management of her business, along with her skill and capacity for work means that this loan will be successfully invested and will be a real help to

Her husband is Angelito, a driver. Together with her husband, Marissa  manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and for their children.\r\n\r\nMarissa maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange.  When a customer orders something, the dealer pays cash for the product and then gives it to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the customer catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are collecting as their income.  Marissa's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan.   She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarissa fervently hopes that her children will be able to finish college. She also hopes to have more income. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work every week.

They're friendly, kind and very charismatic women who strive everyday in order to get their families ahead. They also keep their people's culture and tradition. They live in various areas of the town of Cuenca, which has been a World Cultural Heritage site since December 1999. Its geography is rugged and it's bathed by four rivers. It's home to great artisans; its gastronomy is very diverse and captures the taste buds of both natives and foreigners.\r\nOne of the members of this group is Margoth. She lives in the Las Pencas area of the town of Cuenca. She's 52 years old and married, and from her marriage she conceived four children. Two of her children are married and live independent lives; her two youngest children attend one of the town's schools. Her husband works as a private employee.

That was why she added soups and traditional foods. Later, she bought infrastructure such as a table, kitchen items and a stove. Eventually, she had all her infrastructure with an industrial stove that she bought a good price because its owner had gone broke. That was how her first business experience happened, and that gave her the basis to aspire to open other micro businesses in a neighboring country to finally return to the city of Baranquilla, buy her house and start a new adventure but with a better base in her home country. At present, she sells various merchandise via specialized catalogues, especially cosmetics and also organic and multi-use products. Her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital to acheive her growth potential. That is the reason she has turned to a Kiva loan, through which she will buy organic products, cosmetics and multi-use.
