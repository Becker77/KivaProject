O. is 40 years old, has finished college with a degree in accounting, is married and has 4 children. Mukim has been running a small cafe for the last 10 years. He is planning to use the loan to fix the building in which his cafe is located and purchase a heater for the space. This loan will allow him to improve the appearance of his cafe and the people who use it will be able to dine in a warm and clean atmosphere. Even now his cafe is a busy spot since it is located on the roadside between Rudaki and Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. Mukim is planning to pay back his loan in the next 18 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432

and has two children who are 18 and 15 years-old. The eldest child studies at an institute while the youngest studies at the public school. \nMirtha began working in a retail shop as a salesperson. She worked there for many years but had to quit that job because her mother, who was caring for her children, got cancer and passed away. Shortly after, she started working out of her house, selling groceries like rice, sugar, milk, noodles in a cart.

He lives with his wife and child at his father's house in the Massablacoura quarter of Bougouni (the third largest region in Mali). As he didn't go to modern school, he began earning money very early, notably through buying and selling beauty and party products etc. He learned this business from a friend and with 17 years' experience, he is good at his job and is very sought after. This is his first time working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. In order to strengthen his business he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme so that he could buy large quantities of highlights, creams, pommades, deodorants and perfumes. He buys his goods in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) from wholesalers and sells them in his boutique located in the main market in Bougouni. He makes the most sales around religious festivals and New Year parties. His customers are mostly women. With this loan he plans on earning a monthly profit of 52,500 FCFA. With this income he plans on extending his boutique, paying the interest on the loan and covering other necessities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

and college. She hopes that, one day, all them will have a degree and enjoy a stable career. This is because she saw from her five elder children how hard it is to support a family and yourself without a stable  job and income. \r\n<br>Despite feeling unhappy about her children's situation, Josefina has been able to find strength through Kiva partner, ASHI. With ASHI, she has been able to request a loan and finance her family\u2019s rice farming business, which is managed by her husband and sons. The proceeds from this business go towards meeting her family's needs. However, due to sudden climate change, their business and income is affected. For this reason, Josefina requested a loan to purchase a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for a transportation business to be managed by her husband (while she supports  the farming business). Now, Josefina is hoping to purchase another tricycle to be managed by one of her unemployed sons. \r\n<br>Despite the non-stop challenges Josefina encounters in her everyday life as a wife, mother and businesswoman, her hope of having a better kind of life in the future never fades. With ASHI, this hope has become even brighter.

Dalmacia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,880 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dalmacia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

This will be the second loan taken out by Dalmacia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Lida B., 48, dreams for the best, but more than that, she acts to make it a reality. Lida is married to Jimmy B., a factory worker. They have three children who are now in elementary, high school, and college. Together, they live in Malaria, Caloocan City. \r\n\r\nLida has taken vocational courses. With the learning she gains as a Community Partner in CCT*, Lida runs her own sari-sari (variety) store to capitalize on the big target market she has in her community. She has been doing business here for seven years. It is quite easy for her since it is a residential business, and there is not much need at present to hire employees. She earns an estimated net income of 500 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her store, Lida is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She plans to use the funds to buy more grocery items to put in her store, so that it won\u2019t look bare and incomplete. Lida makes an effort to maintain her business in good shape, because a profitable business translates to family needs being met and the schooling of her children being supported. \r\n\r\nLida struggles with time management when it comes to balancing business, health and family life. However, she sees to it that these struggles will not prevent her from reaching her dreams for her family. She desires to see her small store grow and eventually expand. She dreams of having good health for everyone in the family and being able to send her children all the way through college. Deep inside, she knows that if there is faith, and action, everything will be possible.\r\n\r\nWith her going to CCT fellowship* meeting every week, she was able to improve and enjoy her relationship with God. As a Christian, through the Word of God, she also gained strength and inspiration day after day.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":700089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Business Description<\/h4> <p> Mr. Cesar has been working as a grocer of fruits and cheeses for 20 years now. He learned this trade as an adolescent working for his Uncle and then took this experience to start his own business. He sells his fruits from a bicycle and he travels throughout his neighborhood with his products. He starts working at 8am and finishes at 6pm, with a lunch break from 1pm-3pm, from Monday to Friday and during the mornings on Saturday and Sunday from 8am-1pm. <p> <h4> Loan Use<\/h4> Mr. Cesar wishes to purchase more fruits, and since he also has experience selling prawns, he would like to expand this area of sales. By doing this, he will be able to better tend to his customers and to meet his high demand which is increasing. With this loan he will be able to expand his business even more. <h4> Personal Information<\/h4> Mr. Cesar is 41, married and has 4 children, 3 of whom are in school. His home is made of cement and is only a single story and very simple. His older son helps him with his business and his wife takes charge of household chores. He very much wishes to improve himself and his home, so long as business continues to grow and he brings in higher earnings. He also hopes to improve his family's quality of life. <p> Translated from Spanish by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Descripci\u00f3n del Negocio<\/h4> \r\n\t\r\n<p> Don Cesar se dedica hace 20 a\u00f1os al comercio de frutas y queso.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is the oldest child and lives in his parents' house with his younger siblings.  In his village, Cesar works the land from November until May, taking utmost care in planting, and the rest of the year he grazes livestock.  Every weekend he goes to the city to go shopping and to visit his relatives.  They are very grateful to him for his agricultural work, but the bad thing is that he cannot rely heavily on the crops because they are seasonal, so he has to wait for the rain for the seeds to germinate.  He has planted 2 hectares of potatoes and is worried about the lack of rain.  He therefore longs to purchase irrigated land, so that he no longer has to worry about the rain or ice, which can cause him to lose his crops.  This is the first time that he has come to MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma, a Kiva field partner), and therefore he commits to making his payments on the set dates.  With the money requested, he will buy 6 sacks of fertilizer for his small farm.

F., Elizabeth M. B., Patrick A., John A. TarawA., Edmon K. and Henry Sesay. They work for a local non-governmental organization called Future In Our Hands (FIOH). This is the first time they are seeking a loan from SMT. Because non-governmental organizations' salaries are usually very small and do not allow one to do something big with their lives, they have  come to seek a loan from SMT to allow them to invest in something meaningful. Some of them will invest their loans in business and others will invest in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nFIOH started its operations in 1993 and has it headquarters in Makeni with sub-offices in Mile 91 and Kabala in the north, and Pujehun in the south. FIOH focuses its operations on agriculture and food security. They also provide micro-finance services to local villages in their areas of operations. FIOH is doing well in serving the community people in their areas of operations, however, as a donor driven organization, they are often faced with financial constraints. \r\n\r\nSamuel (front row right), who is heading this group, is the Admin Officer of FIOH. He is forty-eight years of age. He was born in a village called Yele, in the Tonkolili district. He is married with six children between the ages of one and nineteen. His wife is a businesswoman. Samuel has worked as an Admin Officer for FIOH for three years now. He will use his loan to buy building materials for housing. Though he is not expecting to complete the building of his house with this loan, subsequent loans will certainly complete the building of his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":307419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy building materials for housing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":6600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":299.44,"local_amount":898333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":907316.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611659},{"amount":299.44,"local_amount":898333,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":907316.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008595},{"amount":134.45,"local_amount":403333.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":407367.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230932},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662633},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102938},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019950},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864795},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754603},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118143622}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T00:24:11Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":107509,"name":"Bamba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"BAMBA D.

She is interested in helping her family with household expenses, thus ameliorating her mother's worries about the running of the household. For about three years she has been selling clothing on credit, visiting a great number of people at their homes in order to receive their orders. She does this from Mondays through Fridays, utilizing the weekends to purchase her merchandise at the wholesale clothing shops and the central market in her town. Sandra gives credit to her clients who pay her in small installments during the month, when she visits them regularly to collect. This entire process is very labor intensive and tiring, due to the long distances she has to cover in her visits. This is large investment in time and money which she has to manage quite carefully.\r\n\r\nHer biggest desire is to obtain a shop where she can sell her articles and stop making all those trips, as well as establish herself in a permanent location where her clients can visit her.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth credit with Microfinanzas PRISMA.

He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His daughter attends a local primary school. Buyan operates a clothes trading business out of two different containers in his town with the help of his wife. They began their business in 2006, selling a variety of clothing items in a rented container at the local market, with working capital of 1,500,000 MNT, and over the years they managed to establish a successful business in the local community. After years of stable operation, they have expanded their business, and their earnings have enabled them to purchase two containers which they sell their products from. Today their working capital exceeds 6,000,000 MNT. With their business earnings, they were able to not only expand their business but also greatly improve their quality of life. Also, with their business success, they have managed to buy a car for their family. For the future, they plan to build a house in their yard.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

With this problem she faced, she thought of having another business in order to increase their income. In order to pursue her plan, she joined ASHI eight months ago. She loaned for a business capital and she then started her RTW buy and sell business. She sells clothes in their village and after six months, she has able to repaid her loan from the profits she had. Now, she applies for a bigger amount of loan which will be used to finance the growth of her RTW buy and sell business. Someday, when she her business has grown, she will be renting a space open to public for more costumers. She also would like her business to become stable to be able to secure her children financial need.

She also lives with her 68 year old grandmother who helps her take care of her daughters and do the household chores.\r\n\r\nElba makes empanadas.  This is a typical dish made with a banana base, which is formed into dough.  It is shaped into a small ball and has a milk or bean filling.  Then it is fried and served with sugar on top.  The empanadas are made in her house.  Her grandmother helps with the process because they make a fair amount.  She sells them to middle school students at a school in her area.  She also sells them at home with help from her grandmother.  Elba is in charge of selling them away from the school as a traveling vendor in neighborhoods and cantons.  Elba puts forth a lot of effort to sell all of her product everyday because it is the only source of income that she has.  She is the only one supporting her family and paying all of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nThat is the reason she is asking for Integral for a loan.

She is married and has two children who are 22 and 26 years old. They work independently. She has a business buying and selling fruits and vegetables. It is worth noting that she started this business 14 years ago. She began by buying small harvests of lemons, which at that time she sold in her mother's market. Later she  decided to start her own business. At present, she is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 to be invested in purchasing oranges from a 3,500 sq. meter lot. These will be ready to start harvesting in about two months. The harvesting time is about 4 and a half months long. Her dream has always been to have enough of her own capital to not depend on loans to be able to pay for expenses. Nevertheless, she is not complaining about the benefits of financing since it has allowed her to diversify her inventory.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

","en":"This group is called \"EL RINCONCITO\" (The Little Corner).  It is located in the community of Emilio Portes Gil, San Felipe del Progreso.  This community is noted as being different from others because a lot of its residents are professionals.  Most people have university degrees and are teachers.  There are a lot of university students and students in general.\r\n\r\nThis group has 4 members.  It is a small group.  There used to be more people in the group but they decided to take a break for a while and then continue with the group later.  The members are all neighbors who have known each other for years.  They say that the group is called EL RINCONCITO (The Little Corner) because that is what the area they live in is known as because they live in a corner of their community.  Of the group's 4 members, 2 are women and 2 are men.  Their names are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Raymunda M. M..  Raymunda is 55 years old and a saleswoman.\r\n\r\n2.-Ebelia C. G\u00f3mez, 50 years old.\r\n\r\n3.-German R. R., 49 years old.\r\n\r\n4.-Margarito G\u00f3nzalez T., 45 years old.\r\n\r\nThe four members of this group are salespeople.  They sell cleaning supplies and plastic products.  They use carts which they load with merchandise and then go out to sell in different places on market days.\r\n\r\nRaymunda M. is the group's treasurer.  She is 55 years old and she works as an itinerant street vendor, selling trays, creams, razors, bath sponges, etc.  She makes her sales on Fridays and Sundays.  During the week she serves in her grocery store.  She is requesting her loan to restock her store with merchandise and, in this way, make money from both businesses.\r\n\r\nOne of Raymunda's challenges is her sales.  They are not as good as she would hope for.  There are some days when she sells very little and she becomes exasperated.  However, she reinvests the little that she earns in her business and continues working.\r\n\r\nRaymunda's family is quite large.  She has six children: five daughters and one son.  One of her children is married.  The others work.  Only one of her children is still dependent as he is studying and would like to finish his studies.  For this reason, Raymunda continues supporting him and part of her profits go towards paying for his journeys to school and whatever else he needs.\r\n\r\nOne of Raymunda's goals is to keep her business going, even though it isn't much, so that her son can finish school and not have to leave his studies half finished.  Raymunda has been married for 40 years.  She lives with her husband in her own home and her husband works in the fields and helps her with the store when she isn't there."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":687545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay suppliers of soft drinks, chips, cookies and candy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-10T19:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymunda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ebelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"German ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1529.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430821},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3058.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850074},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3822.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292348},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3058.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160606},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":764.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233494}],"funded_date":"2011-01-15T19:13:36Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":268170,"name":"Violeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violeta B. is from the village of Jasaan, Misamis Oriental.

This is 20 year old Negwako M. from Mbeya. She is married with a one-year-old child. Negwako has been running a traditional African cloth business since 2003. Her business is purchasing Traditional African cloth in whole sale and selling them in retail. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee and her sister. Negwako currently earns about $100USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $350USD in order to purchase additional stock of traditional African cloth. In the future, she plans to open another business. Negwako thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>Negwako has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Lending. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microlending is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":216282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Negwako would like to purchase additional stock of traditional African cloth to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T18:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Negwako","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T21:36:41Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970715},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886932},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436192},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130465},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027267},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613292},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010375},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232686},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664502},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105247}],"funded_date":"2008-10-23T20:36:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jen Villareal","image":832064}},{"id":74773,"name":"Khayrullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khayrullo is married and has four children.

In the photo she is found in the back row, second from the right, and is wearing a purple jacket. She bakes pastries, alfajores (a traditional Arabic confection) and various cookies and sells them in a stand that she has created in front of her house. She also distributes wholesale for other business to sell within the neighborhood. Fabiola learned how to make pastries from her father who was a bread-maker and pastry chef.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Fabiola intends to purchase the principle ingredients needed to produce these goodies. Her dream is to one day open a pastry shop in a grand location and afterwards add to it a shop that will sell these ingredients for other to make them too.\r\n\r\nFebiola lives with her husband and 7-year-old daughter. She enjoys participating in the weekly bank meetings along with the other socias (borrowers) and the loan officer. She credits Fondo Esperanza\u2019s weekly bank meetings with enabling her to socialize with other entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences too.\r\n\r\nLa Florida is a community located to the southeast of Santiago (the capital of Chile). The community itself is quite diverse, representing all sectors of socioeconomic levels. This area has an active commercial life which is manifested in the existence of several new shopping centers. In recent years, this sector has experienced explosive growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":576459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more ingredients need to produce her pastries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"La Florida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Englantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossanna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crist\u00edan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1503956,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":84438},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90476},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91053},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91635},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":92218},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92809},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":93405},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94003},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94599},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":95205},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":95817},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":96432},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97044},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":97664},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":98289},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":98869}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.57},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.7},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.76},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.32},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":689.55,"local_amount":357602,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":358529.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844780},{"amount":718.14,"local_amount":372435,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":373400.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110956},{"amount":736.7,"local_amount":382053,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":383043.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177404215},{"amount":755.61,"local_amount":391866,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":392881.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542647}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T19:05:43Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":223109,"name":"Kantai Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kantai Ole P. is 27 years old.

After years of hard work, she continues selling goods and tools in her hardware store which she has owned for 15 years.\r\n\r\nInitially, Delia made her sales as an itinerant street vendor but, over the years, she has grown her business and now she has formal business premises.  This is what she always wanted and it has fulfilled a series of needs in her children's lives.  She uses the profits that she makes in her business to support her household.  Delia considers her business to be very profitable because the construction supplies that she sells are very much in demand in her area, in spite of the competition.  In recent years, more sales outlets have opened around her business but she faces up to them by providing good customer service and putting some of her products on special offer.

Gonz\u00e1lez is 25 years old, is married, and has two children. Her older son is 10 years old and recently enrolled in the sixth grade of primary school, and her younger son is 8 years old and in the fourth grade of primary school. Her husband works as a sub-official of the national police. Her goals are to always work to support her family and improve their situation. Her dream is to establish her own clothing store in her home, where she can offer a variety of products and meet the needs of her clients. She hopes to one day own her own home, as her family currently lives in her mother's house. She also hopes that God will grant her a long life so she can continue helping her children to move forward, pursue professional careers in the future, and be able to meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nYamileth works selling clothing such as shorts, underwear, trousers and shirts. She offers the clothing door to door, taking orders for the items, and has owned this business for 3 years. She first started out selling soft drinks and phone cards, but this activity was not very profitable. A friend suggested that she start selling clothing as this is a profitable activity, and little by little she invested money in this business until it became her main source of income. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for working capital as she needs to purchase shoes, perfume, clothes and other orders. She is thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its partner organizations for improving the economic situation of the people who need their support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

She and her mother engage in a series of income-generating activities such as making uniforms, selling fried meats such as \u201csalchichas\u201d (sausages), and selling merchandise on credit such as bed linens, clothing, shoes, and the latest cosmetics.  Julieth also works as an employee at a job where she exercises the technical skills she learned while attending university.\r\n<p>\r\nShe lives with her husband and five year old son.  Julieth wants to teach her child the values that defined her life and were instilled in her by her parents such as family stability, love of work, and responsibility.  She began working at a young age while studying for her technical degree in information systems.  It was while she was at university that she began her business selling products such as bed linens, towels, and women\u2019s accessories to her classmates with the help of her mother.  Upon finishing her degree, she began working at a private company where she found opportunities to increase her customer base for selling merchandise.  At the same time, she became involved in producing uniforms.  Since she was not directly responsible for the sewing, Julieth began initiating negotiations to create new sources of income and now has contracts with educational organizations.  A woman uses the machine in Julieth\u2019s home to do all the sewing under the supervision of her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has supported the development of her entrepreneurial creativity.  These available credit resources have provided her with opportunities to invest in her businesses and have the capital to increase her earnings.  Another aspect that has improved is her income since she can pay for her son\u2019s studies at a bilingual school.  In addition, she is able to make business purchases in cash so that she can get a better price, which makes her more competitive when selling her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nAs a businesswoman, she is still refining her abilities while working at the job she obtained upon finishing university.  She does all this so that she can provide a better future for her family.  At the moment, Julieth is requesting a Kiva loan to invest in the purchase of fabrics so that she can fulfill her school contracts.  She will also buy different types of merchandise such as clothing, towels, accessories, and shoes.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She learned how from her parents and now she has her own plantings where she grows potatoes, corn and beans that she sells at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  What she likes most about her work is planting the fields since this will produce sales within 6 months.  She has been doing this work for 11 years and what she finds the most difficult is the infestation of insects that can hurt her production.

To make a living, Analiza owns and operates a general store.

Analiza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Analiza is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Analiza from ASKI.
