Manal is a 33-year-old young woman: she is married with no children yet. Her husband is employed but earns a low salary which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Manal's husband has also been fixing electric generators and selling generator spare parts which has been a profitable project. It is located in a good movement area and he has many loyal customers but also needs more support to cover the workshop costs.\r\n\r\nManal is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing spare parts that are necessary for fixing electric generators. This will increase the amount of work and improve the family's income which will enable Manal and her husband to live in better conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see for fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

For 18 years she has lived in the house that she inherited from her uncle in the town of Pampas. She lives with her husband Jos\u00e9 Luis and her two children.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she was very young, she helped her father in his tailoring shop that he has had for 50 years. Everyone in the community knows her father and the good work he does with nice clothing, but now he is in delicate health and will give up his work. This is why Marilu will take the reins of the business. She lacks working capital, since in July there is more demand from customers, who place orders for the suits they will wear in the festivities that will take place during this month. What she needs most are fabrics in various colors and textures, as well as thread of various colors. They also make very colorful tablecloths (like the one in the photo). She is sure to have success in the business, since she knows the customers very well.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \"Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora\" (\"Our Lady of Help\") communal bank. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and in all these years she has learned to work and fight for her goals. In her association, she learned to be responsible and make her loan repayments, which they bring to each monthly meeting. Marilu will use the money to buy fabric, thread, and other materials in order to continue with the family business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1134520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fabric, thread, and other sewing items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3565.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121793}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T21:19:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":448907,"name":"Believe In God Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umarr is the leader of this group of entrepreneurs.

She hopes to make the most of this whole year, saving the money she needs to have a solid amount of capital.  During the afternoons, Mili also works selling tamales and juice from a stall that she rents from the government in a central location in the city.  She has been selling there for many years and hopes to save up the money she needs to remodel her premises and attract more customers. \r\n\r\nMili belongs to the 'Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora' community bank and this is her third loan from MFP.  Over the years, she has learned to work hard and fight to achieve her aims.  In her community bank she has learned to be responsible and make her repayments on time at each monthly meeting.\r\n\r\nMili will invest this money in buying more sweet treats, cookies, chocolates and drinks for her stall."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1134523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sweet treats, cookies, chocolates and drinks for her stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mili","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":726.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121795}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T23:07:45Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":448870,"name":"Siv","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siv is a resident living in Baray district, Kompong Tom province.

She lives in a small village in Tskaltubo district with her two brothers. One of her brothers works in a petrol station and earns a salary. Sopiko and her second brother run an agricultural business. They have a bull and a plot of land, where they grow various vegetables, fruits, and maize. They sell their harvested products on the local open market. The family members work hard, but they still don\u2019t have enough income to save for purchasing additional needed household goods or renovation of their house.\r\n\r\nSopiko requested a loan to repair her house.

We at the Fundaci\u00f3n believe that her Kiva loan will be successful because she\u2019ll be located in a more comfortable spot that\u2019s nevertheless near her present clientele with potential of capturing the interest of a wider customer base.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1134590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to make some physical home improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Baranoa-Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T19:30:05Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zunilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88176},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99878},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102209},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104593},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107034},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109531},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":112087},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":114703},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117379},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120118},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122921},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125789},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":128724},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131727},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134801},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137946},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":141165},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":144459},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":147830},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":151279},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154809},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158421},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":162118},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":182303}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":447297,"name":"Maria Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, contin\u00faa con su negocio de venta de cosa de horno, prepar\u00e1ndola ella misma, todos los d\u00edas horna, negocio que se ha mantenido gracias al esfuerzo y deseo de salir adelante con su familia y mejora de su casa.

Magdalena's husband also does agricultural work for the private company Dirose.  The family is very united and they have good references from a community whose residents work in commerce, farming and livestock raising.\r\n\r\nMagdalena has been raising ducks and turkey-hens in this area for 10 years.  She also farms, growing vegetables for her own use and also for sale.  She grows her crops on a small plot of land out the back of her house.  She will use her loan to buy farmyard birds (young turkey-hens) and to maintain her crops.  She will manage to satisfy the unmet demand in her area, expand her customer portfolio, gain new customers and make additional income for her family.

Both attending public primary school.   Her family lives on the outskirts of a major city in the southeastern part of Albania. \r\n\r\nShe has owned a carpentry shop for the past 12 years and has been able to establish a steady clientele through the years.

He does his work with his building team, providing his services around Siem Reap province, where he lives with his wife and four dependent children. From this business, Sok earns an average of USD $4 each day. Sok\u2019s challenge is that he doesn\u2019t have another business to provide a consistent income when there are no orders from customers of his construction business. \r\n\r\nSok really needs some capital for personal construction needs because his present house is not sufficiently strong to live in.

She previously accessed a 18,000 PHP loan that she used in buying children\u2019s clothing, summer shorts, statement shirts, and other basic everyday wear to expand her product inventory. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more stocks of shirts, shorts and other clothing. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nRedempta hopes that her business will grow and expand someday and for her children to finish their education through all her hard work in her business.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMamerta hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":721311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase such items as charcoal and vinegar for retail sale in her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T21:50:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamerta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303448},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1396.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356180},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2791.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114278},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2792.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350327}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T07:35:00Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":443875,"name":"Sum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sum is 43 years old and is a married mother of six children, residing in the Prey Chor district of Kompong Cham province.

As the main source of income for her family, Sveta has been raising livestock and growing crops for the past 17 years, having launched her business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS).

We met Manuela, 55, here.  She\u2019s a single mother of a son who is already an adult but still lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe is an older woman who despite her age still enjoys supporting herself and earning her own income.  She and her son are partners in a brick factory (material used in home construction).  Her son works there with the help of two assistants who manufacture the bricks that are subsequently delivered to merchants who take them to be sold in various places.  Our friend helps by collecting payment for what\u2019s sold and by taking food to the place where they work.  They\u2019ve been in this business for more than 15 years and they do very well.  This is how they are able to get ahead and earn their daily bread and that of the families of the two people that work with them.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy wood, sawdust and hearts of palm which are the materials used to manufacture these products.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for 8 years and likes it because of the help they give with the loans.  Her dream is to have a vehicle to transport her products directly to building sites.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1134622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood, sawdust and hearts of palm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T23:00:06Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":212.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":212.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335745},{"amount":425,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391526},{"amount":425,"local_amount":425,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150425},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":637.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":637.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383533}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T17:13:45Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:10:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":449186,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana works hard to support her family.

We met Solanda Narcisa here.  She\u2019s 33-years-old, married and has two children who are 12 and 6 years of age and attend school.  Her husband\u2019s an artisan.\r\n\r\nShe relates that this is a group of very humble, hardworking people who decided to join together and form this group when they found out about the benefits the institution provides in order to improve their businesses.  They are in a variety of activities like animal husbandry and general commerce among other activities.\r\n \r\nAlong with her husband she owns a family business.  They have a small factory where they manufacture buttons made of ivory palm.  They work there day to day giving shape to their products which they deliver once a week to wholesalers that come by to then take them to Manta where they are shipped and sent to other countries to be finished there and be sold.  A woman they pay a weekly salary works with them.  She tells us that it\u2019s quite hard work but it has its rewards and produces good profits because they do most of the work themselves.  They\u2019ve had the factory for more than 8 years and have always done very well.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy ivory palm to manufacture the buttons.  This is their and the entire group\u2019s first cycle and they hope to continue getting help from the bank for a long time to come.

She will be able to sew and to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nThe profits derived from this loan will enable her not only to buy her sewing supplies for expanding her business but also to meet certain needs of hers, as well as those of her small family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1138671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 'pagne' cloth and sundry sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-07-13T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-12T23:20:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10336},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10729},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11123},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11516},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11910},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12303},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12697},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13090},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13484},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13877},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14271},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.67,"local_amount":10336,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11056.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072014},{"amount":21.46,"local_amount":10729,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11477.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306414},{"amount":22.25,"local_amount":11123,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11898.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914757},{"amount":23.03,"local_amount":11516,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12319,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047003},{"amount":23.82,"local_amount":11910,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":12740.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436797},{"amount":24.6,"local_amount":12303,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13160.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989214},{"amount":25.4,"local_amount":12697,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13582.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622835},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":13090,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":14002.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364436994},{"amount":112.59,"local_amount":56296,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":60221.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842069}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T04:01:25Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":449202,"name":"Vicenta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicenta is a 52-year-old married woman residing in Talibon, Bohol, Philippines.

They've already had five happy years together. Every day Mar\u00eda pushes herself to get her family ahead in life and to give them the best. \r\n\r\nHer work consists of selling basic needs items and other goods for daily consumption. She has worked since she was eight years old, helping her mother who also worked at this business. However, since being on her own since age 14, she's had to keep working out of necessity to pay the bills. Since then she has generated her own income, and now she does it for the family she's created. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's small store is stocked directly by suppliers that come to her house with all their goods, which she puts in an order for. The one exception is fish, which she buys wholesale at the port in the city. The passing of years has taught her that the efforts of her hands leads to progress, and she knows it very well. Before she used to sell in the streets of the city; now she has a store in the main market of the city, and another, complementary space in her home. Through all that she has gained, she still has many dreams, and that's why she hopes that her business will keep growing. \r\n\r\nThe thing that she likes about her job is that she has time to do a lot of things from her home, and it's going well for her. Even though she says that in months like these commercial demand drops a little, it doesn't discourage her and she continues on. \r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's first loan with Micofinanzas Prisma. She hopes that it goes well, and that the members of her group give her the opportunity to join in to the rhythm of their work. She hopes that it won't be the first and last loan, but rather than she can keep working together for a long time. Already she thinks it's great that they're giving her a chance to be able to have a larger amount of capital for investment. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (600 PEN), she will buy groceries such as a sack of rice, a sack of sugar, a dozen bottles of oil, and a dozen of small cans of evaporated milk, which totals close to 400 PEN.

Vive junto a ella y a su hermana en la casa que le construy\u00f3 su ex c\u00f3nyuge y lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda para forjar su futuro.\n\nRachel tiene como principal actividad de negocio la venta de pescado. Todos los d\u00edas se levanta muy temprano para dirigirse al puerto pesquero de la ciudad para comprar los mejores pescados, frescos y de buen tama\u00f1o. Cuando los tiene, los selecciona por especie y por tama\u00f1o, determina un precio justo y los va acondicionado en una bandeja grande de pl\u00e1stico, luego inicia su recorrido a pie por las principales calles de la ciudad y va ofreciendo a viva voz lo que tiene para vender. Asegura que siempre camina muy contenta y con mucho optimismo.

Sin embargo, sabe que por ahora esa es su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y quiere hacerlo crecer para obtener mayores ganancias, es por eso que ahora ha considerado la posibilidad de vender pl\u00e1tanos porque asegura que es el mejor complemento alimenticio para el pescado y adem\u00e1s porque sus propios clientes le solicitan tal producto, para ello solo necesita contar con el capital necesario y poner manos a la obra.\n\nEste es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, est\u00e1 muy tranquila por el gran apoyo que le est\u00e1n brindando, ya que siente que de esa forma su progreso familiar, econ\u00f3mico y personal puede emerger de manera segura. Del mismo modo, agradece por la solidaridad que ha recibido en su grupo y por toda la orientaci\u00f3n que le ha otorgado su asesor, eso la motiva a seguir esforz\u00e1ndose para cumplir con el pago puntual de todas sus cuotas. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo solicitado (S\/.500) lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de pescados y varios racimos de pl\u00e1tano.

She is characterized by her great friendliness and for the effort that she puts into the activities that she carries out in order to advance. She has a 7-year-old daughter named Jhoana. Unfortunately, she separated from her partner several years ago. It is for this reason that now she works hard to generate the necessary income to improve her quality of life for the benefit of her daughter. She lives with her and her sister in the house that her former partner built for her, and she strives every day to forge their future.\r\n\r\nRachel's principal business activity is selling fish. Every day she gets up very early to head for the city fishing port to buy the best fish, fresh and of good size. When she finds them, she selects them by species and by size, determines a fair price, and arranges them on a large plastic tray. Then she begins her route on foot through the main streets of the city, calling out to offer what she has to sell. She assures that she always walks very happily and with great optimism. She has had this business for just a year. She always works alone. She works all morning while her sister takes care of her young daughter at home, a role that she fills in the afternoons or nights. She confirms that sometimes she has felt that she would pull back because of the intense sun that suffocates her during her constant walking. Nevertheless, she knows that for now this is her only source of work, and she wants to make it grow to obtain better earnings. It is for this reason that she has now considered the possibility of selling bananas because she confirms that it is the best food complement for fish, and furthermore because her own clients ask her for such a product. To do this, she only needs to have the necessary capital and then get to work.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

is Maricar, 35, resident of Manila, Philippines. Her husband is Gary, a vendor, and she is a mother to her children.  She and her husband manage their household while operating their business.\r\n\r\nMaricar operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaricar hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini grocery through all her hard work. She also hopes to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1139390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":7499.97,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7854.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356186},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114284},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3491.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350333},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959501},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094277}],"funded_date":"2012-08-13T01:45:33Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":449241,"name":"Elma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"49-year-old Elma is from the town of Baclayon, Bohol.

She has had her little store for two years and works there with the help of her mother-in-law. Furthermore, she has also been working for seven months selling cosmetics, perfumes, and women's personal care and beauty accessories. She does this among her friends and people she knows. She sells on credit and make her collections in a reasonable period of time; in this way she recoups the necessary capital to restock her merchandise. What she likes is that she is earning what is necessary to cover the basic expenses of her household. It is going well for her, although really she wants to increase her income because she hopes to enlarge her business and have a better display of all the products that she offers.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution. She knows that she can fulfill the requirements of the organization and of her group, being responsible and punctual with her payments. Thus far the members of her group have given her a congenial welcome and offered her the necessary confidence to continue being a good member.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the amount she has applied for (1000 PEN) in the purchase of five perfumes and five talcum powders, whose prices vary from 35 to 40 PEN each. She will also buy a sack of rice and a sack of sugar, whose average prices are 150 PEN each, along with other groceries. She will invest the remaining amount buying water troughs and food for chickens, her other business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1134719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy groceries to stock her store, as well as cosmetics to sell and food for chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T03:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T03:00:34Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.86,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":160.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402067},{"amount":63.68,"local_amount":159.19,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":168.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456343},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452004},{"amount":68.42,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447178},{"amount":54.81,"local_amount":137.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":144.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053079},{"amount":88.81,"local_amount":222.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":234.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188016}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T22:21:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":449243,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic is 39 years old and married with five children.

Her husband is Ronnie, a seaman.  She is a mother to her children.  She together with her husband manage their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nJuliet operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Juliet is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to maintain her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJuliet hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini grocery through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own house someday and to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She says that she works from home along with a friend from Monday through to Sunday for the banqueting business and sells clothes every day and she increases her sales at the weekend.\r\nShe buys her banqueting supplies from the supermarkets in the city of Talca and from low-cost distributors and people give her the clothes to sell.\r\nShe will use the loan to buy molds, flour, cream, pastes, olives, and raisins.\r\nOne of her goals is to have an established business in the center of the city where she lives so she could add machines like whisks and an industrial oven for making her empanadas and cakes for her customers. This would enable her to have better income and a better quality of life for her children.\r\nEugenia lives with her husband and 3 children of 13, 8, and 1 year of age. Her dream is to have a store where she can sell birthday supplies and cakes. \r\nShe is very happy with the opportunities that Fondo Esperanza have given her as they have enabled her to invest in her business. What's more, she fells very comfortable with the company of the other entrepreneurs in the community bank as they share various activities and interests which also serve as a nice distraction. With respect to the trainings at the meetings, she has learned to run her business in a better way.\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region located in the central zone of the country. It constitutes the administrative, cultural, and religious center of the region, being the most important city of Chile's Valle Central. In Chile, there is a curious saying about Talca: \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres.\" Among the explanations for this, some say that it is derived from an original saying in English: \"Talca is like London\" on account of the mist that frequently covers the city in the winter season, like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1135089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy molds, flour, cream, pastes, olives, and raisins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":742857,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":64102},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62287},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63476},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64687},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65922},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65453},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69889},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69372},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":71384},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":72450},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":73835}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.21,"local_amount":126389,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126621.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294333012},{"amount":258.79,"local_amount":128163,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":128399.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879033},{"amount":265.28,"local_amount":131375,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":131616.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147787},{"amount":425.34,"local_amount":210645,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":211032.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380944},{"amount":295.38,"local_amount":146285,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":146554.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988114}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T15:40:20Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":447591,"name":"Luis Uriel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Luis, sigue trabajando con su taxi, pues es el medio de apoyar a su familia, su esposa labora como docente, y sus hijos cursan el a\u00f1o escolar.\nEn lo cotidiano hay d\u00eda, buenos en donde aborda mucho pasajeros, otros d\u00edas no, donde se ve afectado, ya que el costo del combustible ah incrementado y son d\u00edas regulares.\nHoy con este nuevo pr\u00e9stamo comprara llantas nuevas, cambio de anillo y v\u00e1lvulas, engrase y alineaci\u00f3n de direcci\u00f3n, para seguir brindando mejor servicios a sus clientes, haci\u00e9ndose m\u00e1s favorable gracias a los financiamientos en Afodenic ya que no contaba con todo el capital para estas mejora que le es necesaria para su trabajo.\n","en":"Don Luis continues to work with his taxi as it is the means by which he supports his family.

","en":"Teresa, age 61, has lived for five years in the house she bought in Huancay.   This is where she lives with one of her three children, Miguel.  This is also where, five years ago, she sold food at three food stands that she had at the local market.  It turned out to be very tedious to have to work starting in the morning in the cold, and it was especially tedious that what she had to carry was very heavy.   These are the reasons that she became gravely ill.  For that reason she changed her work.\r\n\r\nWhat she now does as her main financial income is sell sheets, shoes, pots, and other kitchen utensils.  It is going very well for her.  Whenever possible she takes catalogs to her customers so that they can place orders.  \u201cThroughout these years I managed to get a lot of income.  That is because the price of my products is cheap in comparison to other brands found in the market,\u201d she says.  Her main advantage is that she sells the products door to door, which is easier for her to reach the customers.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Las L\u00edderes del Centro communal bank.

She lives in the city of Ica, in the district of Subtanjalla, with her small son who is 3 years old. She loves him and he is her reason to keep going. Sadly, for various reasons she is a single mother. She has always been a friendly, hardworking and enthusiast person who gives all of her strength to continue moving forward with her small child. Unfortunately, because of the necessity to work in order to afford her expenses, she is not able to pursue a professional degree, but she would have liked to have been able to do so.     \r\n\r\nBy her own initiative and with the support of her mother, three years ago Magdelena started a small business selling sunglasses and eyeglass frames. She sells in a market in her city. Magdalena likes the work that she does and believes that her business is doing well because her clients seek her out for her novelty items and good service.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena is very thankful for Kiva loans; thanks to the support provided she will be able to buy merchandise, like sunglasses and and different types of eyeglass frames.

Now only one of them lives with her, Creisy. \r\n\r\nShe has made a living raising animals for three years, which she likes a lot because she is always in contact with nature. She has sheep, bulls and cows. She milks the cows every day, extracting five liters of milk which she sells in the city or to another milk vendor in the area. \"The production of milk varies, when they eat green grass, the milk produced increases\", Gloria comments. Her secret is in the planting of the grass, she prepares the land herself where she will cultivate alfalfa and supervises at the time the grass is cut. In this way the grass is not overheated, nor too dry. She also takes advantage of her fields to sow grains in small quantities and sells them in the city. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Corazon de Jesus\" and this is her fifth loan with the MFP. She likes the work a lot that is done within the association because she receives support from the members, all of whom back each other up for the well being of each one. \"In each meeting, we always contribute our shares with responsibility\", she affirms. \r\n\r\nGloria will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of one cow and will use the rest of the money to buy sheep.
