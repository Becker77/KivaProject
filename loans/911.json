She had been coming up with many ideas, but she noticed that in her area there are not many businesses that sell fruits, and that in the morning her neighbors buy fruit for their children's snacks at school.  Therefore, with a small amount of capital, she opened a small fruit shop, and little by little the townspeople got to know her store.\r\n\r\n\"In the mornings, I have many sales.

She is thankful for the D-miro bank because it was the first financial institution that believed in her and in her business administration abilities, providing her with her first loan. Thanks to this loan she was able to open her business just outside the only school that is located in the area known as Sabana Grande and as a result of this her sales have increased noticably. The business is open from 7a.m., because it is at this hour that she sells the most, until 6p.m. She works in the store by herself, because her husband works as a day laborer in a estate. Her children are adults and live on their own, but come to visit. The loan that Irma is requesting is to buy bazaar items and paper supplies.

Eva is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEva sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. Dealers like Eva purchase customers' orders with cash. The customers then have one month to repay. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and so these profits generate the dealer's income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She does a minimum of 2000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, Eva is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to buy merchandise and place orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEva fervently hopes that her children will be able to finish college. She also hopes to have more sources of income. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Por ello se siente muy dichoso al ver como sus cosechas son muy cotizadas entre los comerciantes de la localidad. Alfredo siembra en extensas hect\u00e1reas de terreno agr\u00edcola que le fueron heredados de sus padres, quienes le ense\u00f1aron todo lo que hoy sabe del campo. Cuenta que tienen que invertir un promedio de 7 mil a 10 mil soles para comenzar a sembrar, por ello le resulta un poco dif\u00edcil conseguir la totalidad del capital, ya que es la \u00fanica actividad con la que solventa sus gastos econ\u00f3micos. Ahora desea incrementar sus ganancias para poseer un capital mayor y de esa manera sembrar en mayor cantidad.

","en":"Thirty years ago Alfredo started farming and over the years he has grown different crops such as beans, potatoes, peas, and other vegetables. He feels very fortunate to see how his produce is much sought after by local store keepers. He grows the crops on the extensive parcel of land he inherited from his parents who taught him all he knows today about farming. \r\n\r\nAlfredo explains that an average of 7,000 to 10,000 soles has to be invested at the beginning of the season--a sum that is difficult to get hold of, but farming is the only way he can afford household expenses. Now he wishes to increase his income by buying more seeds and planting more crops.

With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nStaff from this school, like many other schools' staffs within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish on their salaries alone. With the help of loans, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use their loans to buy furniture, a plot of land, or house-building materials, or they can invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nFifty-one-year-old Philip is the leader of this group of teachers. Philip was born in a place called Feiba Lugbu. He is married to a trader and has 4 children, 2 of whom are attending secondary school. Philip has been a teacher for 31 years now.

There, she raised five children but now she only lives with two of them: Max and Axel.\r\n\r\nShe took advantage of the location of her house to sell gasoline, since it is right by a central road. She already has eight years experience and she has been able to beat the competition. However, this is not the job she dedicates the most time to; she also plants barley, beans, and potatoes. She has been doing so for 15 years on rented land as well as her own. She sells high-quality potatoes, separating the small and wrinkled ones. From those she removes, she uses the well-know \"dry potato\" process, which is typical in the region. \"You have to remove that type of potato and then dry them for a few months, flatten them and serve them in various typical dishes. They contain a lot of protein.\" According to Marilu, she sells each sack for an average of 80 soles.

Teachers at this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of 3,000,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nFifty-two-year-old Moiwai is the leader of this group of teachers. Moiwai was born in a place call Kamboma. He is married and has 5 children who attend secondary and tertiary institutions. Moiwai has been a teacher for 27 years. He has requested this loan in order to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, robs, etc., for the construction of a family house. \r\n\r\nStaff from this school, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish on their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1139622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, robs, etc., for the construction of a family house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moiwai \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-21T08:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":295415001},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301950040},{"amount":140,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-20T08:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":611800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308848742},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315871390},{"amount":140,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":611800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236743},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104438},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350020},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":305900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089532}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T21:18:08Z","paid_date":"2013-04-21T09:14:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":447690,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cIMA SUMAC SUNCCO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en la  provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\t\nLa socia es la Sra.

Her husband is a fisherman, and she sells his catch to the people in her locality. \r\n\r\nMa. Ligaya is requesting a loan worth PHP 8,000 to buy additional fishing equipment, like nets and ropes.   This can help improve her husband's catch every time he goes fishing.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ma. Ligaya hopes to develop or improve their fishing business so that they can augment their earnings. She also wants to invest some of their income in some other profitable venture to double their sources of income, so that she can continually send her children to school for better education and learning. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1139652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fishing equipment like nets and ropes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talibon, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10.149167 124.325","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T19:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T19:40:11Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of 4,500,000.00 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to improve on their standard of living. \r\n\r\nForty-five-year-old Nasiru is the leader of this group of teachers. Nasiru was born in Kenema. He is married and has 2 children who attend secondary and tertiary institutions. Nasiru has been a teacher for 10 years. He has requested this loan to buy house-building materials: bags of cement, iron corrugated zincs, nails, etc., for the construction of a family house. \r\n\r\nStaff from this school, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish tasks that they would otherwise not be able to do on their salaries alone.

She lives in a home she bought 32 years ago in the area of Yanamarca. There she built a family with her spouse Fidel and her seven children, of whom only three still live at home; Jones, Cinthia, y Diana.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning she only sowed potatoes, olluco (a Peruvian tuber), barley, and broad beans in her fields that she had irrigated, which is to say the ones close to the river which could be irrigated and fertilized the most easily.  Currently, she is still involved in agriculture, but her most consistent soure of income is in raising poultry, which she has 32 years of experience in keeping.  She now has five pigs, two bulls, and two pregnant cows.  For this reason, she has much less milk production, \"I cannot stop producing milk, I need to buy a milk cow to not lessen my production, and when my cows give birth, then I'll have really great production, since their milk supply will greatly increase,\" she comments.  Now, she is concentrating on this project, since she already has customers who buy her milk and she can't let them down.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d and this is her second loan with MFP.

She makes a living selling food, breakfast, and lunch in her cafe. She sells a variety of foods, such as rice and beans and flat breads. Her business is located in a nearby trading center, where she's had it for several years. \r\n\r\nWith time, she has gained a lot of experience in the kitchen and with sales. She has a lot of customers as she prepares the most exquisite dishes in the area. People prefer her because everything is very hygienic, made with the best-quality raw materials, and affordable, and she has the fastest service. \r\n\r\nJessy is a woman who loves her work and devotes herself to it day after day.  She knows that only if she puts in her best effort and motivation will she reach success. One of her biggest dreams is to expand her business to a hotel.

Her husband is a truck driver, her children study in the village school and her parents-in-law are pensioners. The main activity of the family is an agricultural business. They have 1 hectare of land, where they grow vegetables and fruits. The family has bee-hives with bee colonies too. They produce honey and sell it in nearby villages. They have milking cows and produce dairy food, cheese, cards and yogurt, part of which is used by the family members and the rest is sold locally. Roman has a truck. He takes wood from the forest and sells it in his village and nearby villages. All family members work hard during the days.\r\n\r\nNestan and her family requested a loan to purchase tires for the truck, because they are old and it is already risky to drive in the forest. For this reason, Roman has stopped operations. They will buy new tires.  After changing them, Roman will be able to continue transportation and sales of wood. This will increase the income of the family. With increased income they will be able to improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1139708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase tires for a truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chikuneti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T21:50:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":117.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":125.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":138.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":157.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":163.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":173.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.84,"local_amount":123.82,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":125.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449596},{"amount":71.83,"local_amount":117.27,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":118.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209803},{"amount":75.34,"local_amount":123.01,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":124.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440573},{"amount":76.68,"local_amount":125.19,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":126.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045625},{"amount":80.19,"local_amount":130.92,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":132.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181618},{"amount":81.85,"local_amount":133.63,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":135.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565495},{"amount":84.54,"local_amount":138.03,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":139.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115076},{"amount":678.73,"local_amount":1108.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860572}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T10:12:20Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T15:51:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Meltzer","image":null}},{"id":447706,"name":"Valentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cJUNTOS A TRABAJAR\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Apart from this, she has always liked this work because she has control over her time and is also able to devote herself to the care of her children.\r\n\r\nThis business is something that she works at alone, without help, because it doesn't generate enough income to be able to afford another employee.  She works throughout the day there, since she prefers as much as possible not to close, since she could lose a potential customer during the time she is not open and that wouldn't be starting out with good service.  With the loan she is asking for, she will buy products to restock her business, gain people's attention, and result in a greater customer base.  In the future, Am\u00e9rica would like to have a larger business and a house that has all the amenities."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1135201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, food staples, detergents, grains, and other household items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"America Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1571.27,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":97.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":101.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":108.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":111.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":113.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":449558,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth lives in the Likoni area of Coast province, Kenya.

His partner's name is Lidia and the couple have two children: 8-year-old Nilver and 5-year-old Vanesa.  They all live in their own home which is located in the indigenous community of San Pablo de Shimashiro (in the central jungle).\r\n\r\nLuis has been farming for two years.  It is the main way he provides for his family.  He has eight 'cuadras' (just under fourteen and a half acres) of farmland that the community gave him but he only works on four of them.  He produces coffee, bananas, cassava and ginger.  \"I have more coffee than the other crops.  It is more boring to grow but the profits are good\", he says.  One of the main difficulties he faces is a lack of workers to deal with his crops quickly.  Last harvest time he had to hire people in order to be able to fulfill his sales.

In addition, she enjoys the educational talks that her group receives because they have taught her how to improve her sales.

Her partner is Benancio and the couple have nine children.  They currently live with seven of their children in their own home which they worked hard to build.  It is located in the indigenous community of San Pablo de Shimashiro.\r\n\r\nVacelisa has been farming since she was a girl.  She started being responsible for her family when she was 16 years old and now works with a lot of experience.  She currently has nine plots of land, which are 25x12 meters, where she grows coffee, cacao and cassava.  She has been working with a coffee company for five years and so she has a guaranteed market for her produce.  She has also set up a space in her home and opened a store in which she sells groceries, food products and other staple products.  This makes her additional income.  With the help of Benancio and three of her older children she is able to care for her crops.  \"Every month we have to weed the coffee plantation or we don't obtain good yields\", she says.  For this reason, she spends most of her time in the fields.  One of her goals is to improve her coffee yields as she has someone to sell her produce to.\r\n\r\nThis is Vacelisa's second loan from MFP and she is keen to mention that she will make her monthly repayments on time.  She belongs to the Los Shirokis community bank which has nine very enthusiastic members.\r\n\r\nVacelisa will use this loan money to buy bags of fertilizers to fertilize her coffee crops.  She will invest 1,500 soles in this.  She will spend the rest on food products so that she doesn't neglect her grocery business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1135318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her coffee plantation and some products for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-14T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-13T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vacelisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450599070}],"funded_date":"2012-07-28T03:31:18Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T10:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":449580,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy lives in the Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya.

The breakdown is as follows:\r\n- After spending 15,000 FCFA per day to prepare various breakfast dishes, she leaves with a daily net profit of 4,000 FCFA.\r\n- Each bag of manioc costs 17,000 FCFA and is resold at retail for 21,000 FCFA\r\n- Each bag of aubergine costs 7,000 FCFA and is resold for 11,000 FCFA\r\n\r\nAt the end of each day, after subtracting business-related expenses, she finds herself with an average net profit of 7,000 FCFA per day.\r\n\r\nThe profits from her business will allow her to save money and support her husband at

She laso owns four cows, eight rams and small domestic animals like guinea pigs, which she raises and sells after a few months.  Yet the activity which she most enjoys is the sale of milk.  \"I have three cows that produce milk, and the business runs every day, so I never forget to feed and care for my animals,\" she says.  With these activities, she has successfully educated her only son, who helps her in her work in the fields, especially during the planting and cultivation of her crops.  She currently has three parcels of land planted in peas, which she thinks she will harvest in August.  Each parcel will produce at least 20 sacks of 60 kilos each.  One of her goals is to plant alfalfa to feed her animals and to sell to other ranchers.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and therefore she feels certain to pay her monthly loans payments punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the money from her loan, she will be able to acquire alfalfa seeds to begin planting pasture land for the feeding of her animals"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1135342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The 3 live in their own house which they themselves constructed in the native community of Santa Teresa in the central forest.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago she began working in agriculture in the countryside. Rubi and Nino now have 6 plots of land assigned to them by the community.

In addition, she can count on a culture of saving that permits her to cover expenses all year. For his part, her husband works as a day laborer on other parcels of land, thus obtaining income to pay some of their inevitable expenses. Rubi has just finished the harvest and sale of the final grains of coffee. For this reason, she will begin cleaning the land and maintaining their plants. For that reason, she needs to purchase sacks of organic fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis is her 2nd loan through MFP.

She is married, with two children. She is a college graduate. She works as director of a state agency in her district. Her salary is very low, which is why, in addition to her regular work, she also grows livestock by her house. She has been doing this for over 20 years. She has 17 heads of livestock. She is very knowledgeable in this area. Her husband helps her in his business. He sells livestock at the livestock market, since this is the family's main source of income. Husniya has been taking out loans with our organization since 2010. She never violated loan terms. She is  a very responsible, conscientious woman. She would like to use her credit to increase her livestock and expand her business.

The group is now composed of 21 women who have a strong sense of solidarity and all live in the same village. Most of them work as vendors. Mrs. Fatoumata (seated on the far right raising her right hand) is a star borrower. She is 20 years old and married, without children. She manages a store in the village. With this loan, she will buy three bags of rice at 13,500 West African francs and a bag of sugar at 30,000 francs. The resale price of these products is 360 and 650 West African francs per kilogram, respectively. This new loan will allow her to purchase in high quantity and thus save on the cost of multiple trips. The revenues derived from her business will allow her to build up her savings, with the future goal of getting bigger loans, being able to better finance her business and  improving her life conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1129586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy three bags of rice at 13,500 West African francs and a bag of sugar at 30,000 francs.

Desde los 15 a\u00f1os ya sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo funcionaba el negocio de sus padres, por eso no fue tan dif\u00edcil hacerse cargo de sus propios cultivos, al lado de Javier. Por la extensi\u00f3n de sus terrenos, a veces ellos dos no se abastecen para limpiar los cultivos, por esa raz\u00f3n contratan personal operario para agilizar las labores. Esta mujer siente que reci\u00e9n est\u00e1 empezando y m\u00e1s adelante quiere mejorar su producci\u00f3n de achiote, ya que sus precios tambi\u00e9n son favorables.\n\nEste es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que recibe de MFP. Agradece el apoyo en la primera ocasi\u00f3n y de la misma manera menciona que ser\u00e1 puntual en el pago de las cuotas mensuales. \u201cLos Ompicres\u201d es el nombre de su banco comunal y le agrada compartir experiencias en com\u00fan con sus socios.\nInvertir\u00e1 el dinero de este pr\u00e9stamo en el pago de los jornaleros a quienes contratar\u00e1 para la limpieza y para el esparcimiento de fertilizantes en su cafetal.","en":"Elsa is 23 years old. Her husband's name is Javier and they have three children, ages 7, 6 and 3. The young family lives in a small country house they built themselves in the community of Santa Teresa, Pichanaki, in the central forest. \r\n\r\nDespite having to take care of three young children, Elsa is dedicated to farming. Thanks to her parents and in-laws she owns eight plots of land, where she grows coffee, bananas, annatto and yuca. She mentions proudly that she harvests especially large quantities of coffee. Elsa's parents also worked in agriculture, so she had fifteen years of experience before cultivating her own crops with Javier.  \r\n\r\nSince their farm has grown over time, Elsa and Javier are often unable to manage the harvest on their own so they hire temporary farm laborers to speed up the work. Elsa is hoping to hire more help soon, because it is time to harvest her annatto crop and the market prices are high. This is her second loan from MFP. She appreciated what the first loan allowed her to do and is committed to making her monthly payments on time. Her community bank is called \"Los Ompicres\" and Elsa is grateful for the company of its members. She will use the loan funds to pay day laborers to maintain and apply fertilizer to her coffee plantation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1135346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay the day laborers working on her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":163.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":172.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":192.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":205.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":215.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":226.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":243.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":252.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.65,"local_amount":143.61,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":147.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402072},{"amount":63.18,"local_amount":163.06,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456353},{"amount":66.79,"local_amount":172.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":177.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452014},{"amount":71.68,"local_amount":185,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":190,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447187},{"amount":74.66,"local_amount":192.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":197.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053089},{"amount":79.74,"local_amount":205.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":211.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188025},{"amount":16.15,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572014},{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":91.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":93.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121805},{"amount":38.93,"local_amount":100.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576692},{"amount":272.82,"local_amount":704.07,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T09:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":723.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450599072}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T04:15:02Z","paid_date":"2014-04-18T09:09:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":449660,"name":"Lowela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lowela is 47 years old.

She grows coffee over four 'cuadras' of land (just over 7 acres), cacao on another (1.8 acres), annatto on another and citrus fruits such as oranges and mandarins on another.  She says that last year a disease affected her citrus fruits and so she didn't make good profits.  However, her coffee, cacao and annatto always save her because they are profitable.  Lola does not give up easily and she will continue growing her citrus fruits.  She will invest in buying more bags of fertilizer for them.  Right now, she is planning to grow ginger as her immediate goal because she says that it is profitable.\r\n\r\nThis is Lola's second loan from MFP and so she gives her word that she will make her repayments responsibly.

He starts by getting rid of weeds in order to begin any planting work.  He currently grows coffee, bananas, corn, cassava and ginger.  He has seven plots of land where he grows these crops.  Over the years he has been farming, he has had a lot of satisfaction as well as some failures.  He remembers that, twelve years ago, he lost all his corn and ginger crop because of pests.  This experience taught him to take precautions and be prepared for a lack of rain, or insects.  Since then, his harvests have given him better results.  He now plans to start sowing more corn and bananas and he needs several bags of organic fertilizer and seeds to do this.\r\n\r\nThis is Faile's eleventh loan from MFP.

This oil is very much in demand because of its high percentage of vitamins.  \"Two years ago they came to train us and now we have an oil processing plant in our community\", he says.

His business is buying and selling food products and he does this every day.  Every day he goes out with his small cart and sells in all the streets, providing housewives with fruit, vegetables, tubers and meat, products that every household consumes on a daily basis.  His business idea came about when he left the south of Bol\u00edvar department, looking for better opportunities for work and peace in the city of Barranquilla.  He started selling beef, chicken, fruit, vegetables and tubers.  He is still in the same business now and travels from street to street in the south-west of the city.  He sells retail and by the unit, ounce or pound.  He sells to customers who do casual work and odd jobs or to housewives who need to buy small amounts.  He buys his products for cash and makes his sales in the same way.  His business is growing but he does not have enough working capital to respond to his customers with competitive prices which he could manage if he were to buy in larger quantities.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will use it to buy meat, vegetables, cassava, bananas and chicken.  With his Kiva loan, he will be able to take advantage of discounts that his suppliers in the market have promised him if he makes his purchases cash in hand and buys larger quantities than he usually does.  His goal in the future is to buy his own home where he can set up his business, in a very busy commercial area.

Since he was very young he has worked as a merchant, selling dairy products in his sister's company. It was going well for them there until his sister passed away and he went to the city to live with his brother. From him he learned the trade of electrician and maintenance, which he started to work in. He married and returned to the city of Barranquilla where he now works in a hotel in town as chief of maintenance. Six years ago, in order to increase his family income, he decided to invest his savings in buying foreign brands of shoes that come to him from the neighboring country of Panam\u00e1. he sells them to a select group of customers. Tom\u00e1s' wife is also a very capable entrepreneur who sells clothing and perfume to help the household income. They both work in order to provide for their 14 year old son and give him everything he needs for his wellbeing and for future professional success. At present, Tom\u00e1s needs working capital to make purchases in larger quantities of shoes such as Addidas, Nike, and Reebok, which he has orders for. He wants to respond quickly and also buy in larger quantities to reduce the sales cost, thus resulting in competitive prices to gain more customers. This way he will increase his sales and little by little make his dream come true of having a vehicle and expanding his business.

Her husband is Charlie, a security guard, and she is a mother to her child.  She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and also for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes her business will expand and grow into a mini-grocery through all her hard work. She also hopes to give her child a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1140455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8379.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303457},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2793.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356194},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.96,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5586.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114292},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.04,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4190.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350341}],"funded_date":"2012-07-16T08:09:33Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":449735,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie, who is married and has a ready-to-wear business in the Philippines, works hard to support her family.

He and his mother started a restaurant in Cartagena two years ago and moved it to Barranquilla when they returned there.  They open the restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  Their main customers are people who live in the neighborhood or workers at the factories nearby.  Julio wants to study for a degree in Electronics.  He hopes that his business will grow and prosper because it is the main source of income for him and his family.  He plans to buy bulk supplies of the goods he needs for the restaurant so that he can save on transportation costs, lower his costs for the goods and save the time he has to spend buying what he needs for the restaurant.  He will use this Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan, with help from Kiva lenders, to buy what he needs--rice, cooking oil, pasta, salt, sugar, sauce and tableware--to operate his business and provide a better service.  The investment will help him grow the business.  Our analysis shows that he can cover the costs of his monthly payments with only 18 days of revenue and that his profit margin is 18% or more.

","en":"Luz Dary is 47 years old.  She is a married woman who lives in the south of the city together with her husband and her two children who are 18 and 21 years old.  She has been selling bags, belts and footwear for 15 years since she started her business to make a second income for her family and improve the welfare of her household.  Luz Dary sells bags and leather goods every day direct to end consumers.  She mainly sells on credit although she also occasionally sells for cash.  She buys directly from manufacturers for cash.  Her customers are company workers who make a salary and so her business has done very well.  On pay days she goes to visit her customers in order to collect payment.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan.  It is her seventh from  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and previous loans have enabled her to have capital available.  This has increased her possibilities for buying merchandise and increased her sales volumes.  Luz Dary will use her Kiva loan to respond to orders that her new customers have promised to place with her.  These are customers who have been referred to her and who will help her to strengthen her business even further.  Luz Dary will buy footwear, bags and wallets in larger quantities.  She plans to grow her business as she hopes to support her children in finishing their university studies.  Her biggest challenge is finding new manufacturers so that she can diversify the fashionable designs she sells as this attracts customers.  It also helps her to stay in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1136442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

The revenues from her business will allow her to grow her savings and to provide for part of the everyday family expenses and her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1135525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock up on staple foods from wholesalers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djilang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Idiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne Marie Noelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fanseyni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata B Sadio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Badiare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Binta Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Telly Bailo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sounkarouo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1755000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1755000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3275,"local_amount":1755000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1755255,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339483483}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T06:05:21Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:25:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":449776,"name":"Janeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeth is 24 years old and married.

With this loan, she will buy oils, beverages, pastries, undergarments, knitted items, and T-shirts to restock her business.  One of Nancy\u2019s goals is to continue her business so that she can generate more income and choose a better quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nNancy lives with her husband and son.  Her husband helps with the sales in her business and her son is working.  Her dreams include seeing her son in charge of the business when she and her husband are not able to work.  \r\n<p>\r\nNancy is very pleased and appreciative of the opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza so that she can invest in her business.  In addition, she feels very comfortable to be in the company of other entrepreneurs in her Communal Bank group with whom she shares different activities and interests.  Their meetings also provide her with a moment of distraction.  With respect to the training classes conducted during their meetings, she has learned how to manage her business better.  \r\n<p>\r\nRancagua is part of the Libertador Bernardo O\u2019Higgins region. This modern city is one of the main producers and exporters of fruits and wine in Chile. It is also a mining city because it is the home of \u201cEl Teniente\u201d, one of the largest underground mines in the world with 4500km of tunnels.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1135030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
