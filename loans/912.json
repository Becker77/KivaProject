She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Grace's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine Pesos (PhP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nGrace lives in Cavite City with her husband and business partner Dano. The two of them manage their household together while operating the business. They work hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help Grace continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PhP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGrace hopes to grow her business and increase her client base in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1140629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Puth is now 36 years old and is married to Men, her husband, who works as a paid worker in a plantation and also a tractor operator. \r\n\r\nPuth needs a vehicle to support her selling business. Due to not having one, she has had a lot of expenses in transferring her vegetables to the marketplaces. In connection with this, she decided to take out additional capital of KHR 2,500,000 to purchase a used motorcycle that is connected to a trailer in the back. Puth is very happy with the given loan because it has a positive impact on her current business. She will be able to transport a greater amount of vegetables at a time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1130142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a motorcycle for her vegetable selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-07-15T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-14T23:40:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Puth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208400},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":207600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":208400,"processed_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":213714.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294368869},{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":208400,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":213714.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301422080},{"amount":520.8,"local_amount":2083200,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2136321.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182451}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T19:14:09Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T10:08:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":448193,"name":"O\u00f1ondivepa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las integrantes de este comit\u00e9 se dedican a variadas actividades.

These past loans have helped her to successfully pay the fees related to her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a new loan in the amount of $1,000 US dollars. She will use part of her loan to buy fertilizers and part of it to fix the battery charger so as to allow the family's battery-charging business to continue to generate income.

Each of the women is the proprietor of a small business, specializing in weaving, animal husbandry, agriculture and selling food, among other trades. \r\n\r\nAs treasurer, 34-year old Gladys has taken an active role in the success of the Trust Bank. A single mother of two girls who are currently going to school (5th grade and 1st grade), Gladys affirms that the continuation of her girls\u2019 education is very important to her, as she was not able to attend school after 4th grade. Gladys has a great personality; she is fun, happy, and likes to help others and, above all else, she is a hard-working woman who not only sustains herself and her two girls but also her father who is sick. Gladys is involved in animal husbandry, and currently she has ten chickens, one pig and one bull. She has also established a small convenience store where she sells rice, eggs, beans, coffee, snacks, oil, candies, bread and other goods. The store is installed in half of her kitchen, and also she sells portions of food and snacks in the front yard of her house to local residents.  \r\n\r\nWith her previous loans Gladys has been able to increase her inventory, as well as buy her children\u2019s school supplies to ensure that they are able to continue to receive the education that is so important to her. This will be Gladys\u2019s third loan cycle, and she is excited to use the funds to expand her business. She will use the new loan to buy more items for her convenience store, and she also plans to buy two more pigs. When they are not in school, Gladys\u2019 daughters help her with the animals and help her manage her store.\r\n\r\nAs one of the founders of the Flor de Esperanza Trust Bank, Gladys is invested in using her loan to make a better life for herself and her family and ensuring that the other eight women are able to do the same. For that reason, she opens her home every month for the group meeting with Friendship Bridge, where the women receive and participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their families\u2019 health, but also foster a community of support among the women. One member of the group, Sandy, smiles as she says, \"We are thankful for the opportunity of microloans as it helps us to promote our small businesses and improve our quality of life.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1138999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Like the other ten women in the group, they strive every day in order to achieve their goals and create better lives for themselves. The businesses that the members of the group are engaged in are varied and include: weaving, embroidering, and animal husbandry, among others.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Trust Bank, Lucia, is 45 years old and has four children with her husband, Mason.

She joined Friendship Bridge so she could expand her business.\r\n\r\nLucia is very excited for the opportunity provided by her Trust Bank and by Friendship Bridge to obtain a loan, which will serve to buy hens. She hopes to take advantage of raising more chickens and selling eggs. Lucia's long-term dream is to obtain her own farm, because she is currently renting. Her short-term goal is to see her second child graduate from high school next year. Through the participatory non-formal education lessons provided by Friendship Bridge at the monthly loan repayment meetings, Lucia has learned how to effectively support her children\u2019s education. She and the other women have also benefited from lessons on business practices, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and health. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their families\u2019 health, but also foster a community of support among the women.\r\n\r\nLucia and the other 13 women in the Trust Bank are both surprised and grateful that people from elsewhere have focused their attention on their small village and have given them the opportunity to make their dreams a reality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1141114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy hens.

farmer, who used to work as a dispatcher at a collective farm.  She and her husband decided to get involved in farming in the 1990s.  They leased 12 hectares of land, which they work on now.  Evgeniya and her husband grow thistle, pumpkins and flax.  What is noticeable about them is that they have a processing facility, where they make oil from these crops.  The farmer found a market to sell these products in the Crimea.  During the last two years, thanks to the information, provided by the Ukrainian horticultural development project and by public organization, called \"The Union of Women-Farmers\" in the Zaporozhskaya area, Evgeniya started to grow grapes and became interested in growing strawberries.  Her husband, who has worked as a chief engineer at a collective farm, helps her to work on the land.  The family has a grown son, who lives in another region.  He works as an agronomist and can provide his parents with a lot of help through consultations.  Evgeniya is a very active and goal-oriented person.  Despite difficulties that arise, she always strives to move forward.  It is difficult for the majority of small and medium farmers to obtain financing in Ukraine, and interest rates for these loans are very high.  Thanks to the expected loan for soil cover, mulching plastic, pump and a drip irrigation system, Evgeniya can now start planting strawberries according to all of the contemporary requirements.  Evgeniya understands that following all of the agricultural norms is a start to success and getting quality produce.  \n\nEvgeniya tries not to be stagnant and visits various educational events to increase the level of her knowledge.  She dreams of a comfortable home.  She understands that a person's social responsibility is one of the important components of life, and this is why helping the regional village house has a place in her life.  She needs your help to finance a soil cover, mulching plastic, pump and a drip irrigation system, and also espaliers for grape

business, low incomes within the family, making it difficult to even take care of some basic needs, and not having a proper education as she dropped out of school due to lack of school fees. The death of her elder brother further compounded the situation. However, joining GHAPE in 2010 made her see light on the horizon due to their numerous offers like cheap and affordable business financing, loan payment duration, training in life skills and business\/marketing techniques.\n\nThe loan is going to assist her to expand her business as she will add the quantity of all the food items in her catering business by buying wheat in bags, beans in bags and vegetable oil in tins. She will repair her dilapidated structure and buy new chairs and more plates and cups, as well as generally increasing the food items. Her activity will help the community in which she operates since it is a business district. The business will succeed because of the high demand from the workers around this business zone. The profits will be used to assist her husband in improving their housing situation, provide better health care for her family and also increase the size of her restaurant.

She is divorced and raising two children. She is an IDP and lives with her family in a Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She breeds cows and calves and then sells the milk and milk products, as well as cattle meat to the local butchers. She also raises sheep for meat. Teyfa has more than 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to her father, who taught her the best way to look after cattle. \n\nTeyfa usually buys calves, raises them, and fattens them. After 5-6 months, she sells them for a more profitable price at a local livestock bazaar. She sells milk and yoghurt to her neighbors. Selling the milk and meat brings in 220 AZN per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes like pilau and dolmas, and they always use a yoghurt-based sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also present in everyday life. Her brother helps her to run the business.   \n\nThis is the only source of income for her family, and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of her beloved children.

He is an internally displaced person (IDP) and lives with his family on the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.   He breeds cattle and sells milk and milk products as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Mahammadali has more than 20 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him how best to look after cattle. He receives a pension from the government each month, but this is too low to cover the family's needs.\n\nMahammadali usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months and resells them for a profit in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat-selling brings an income of 180 AZN per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

Tambi\u00e9n vende refrescos de sabores regionales como \u201cchicha morada\u201d y \u201ccocona\u201d. Se inici\u00f3 con un pr\u00e9stamo de MFP hace 3 a\u00f1os y desde entonces atiende sola a sus clientes. Considera a su negocio bastante rentable, por las buenas ganancias que le deja, pues tiene una constante clientela y los productos tiene bastante acogida por lo calurosa de la regi\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, le gusta lo que hace, pues le permite estar en casa y cuidar a su peque\u00f1o hijo, al que quiere mucho, adem\u00e1s de los ingresos econ\u00f3micos que le genera para pagar los gastos de su hogar. El problema es cuando llueve muy seguido, pues dificulta la venta, pero eso no la desanima. Por tanto, tiene planes de seguir creciendo y abrir una tienda donde venda abarrotes y comestibles.\n\nEste es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 4 que tiene con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Por tanto cuenta con este pr\u00e9stamo para que pueda cumplir con sus objetivos. Promete que ser\u00e1 responsable con el pago de sus cuotas, como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores.\n\nCon el monto solicitado, de 2000 nuevos soles, invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s gaseosas de diversas marcas y presentaciones, en mayor volumen. Tambi\u00e9n en los ingredientes e insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de los refrescos, como frutas regionales (cocona) y ma\u00edz morado, en mayor cantidad.","en":"Lucia is 28 years old, she is a hard-worker and very dedicated.  She is also friendly and respectful.  She is married to Enrique who works in construction and he is the father of their only son.  They live in their own house that they struggled to buy.\r\n\r\nShe sells soft drinks and uses a refrigerator and freezer that she bought with her savings so that she can keep her drinks cold, just the way her customers like them.  She also sells other refreshments from the region such as \"chicha morada\" and \"cocona.\"  She received her first loan three years ago from MFP and since then she has served her customers well.  Her business is profitable because she constantly has customers and her products are well-known in the region.  She is happy with how things are going as it allows her to be home and care for her young son, whom she loves a lot, and the income she generates helps them pay their household expenses.  The problem is that when there are heavy rains it is difficult to make any sales, but this doesn't discourage her.  She has plans to continue growing her business and to open a store to sell snacks and groceries.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan from MFP.  With this loan she will be able to meet her objectives.  She promises to be responsible with her payments, as she was with her previous loans.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 2000 nuevos soles she will buy more soft drinks of various brands and sizes, and she will buy them in bulk.  She will also buy the ingredients and supplies that she needs to prepare her refreshments, such as regional fruits (like cocona) and blue corn.  She will also buy them in bulk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1136675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more soft drinks for sale and the necessary ingredients to prepare her refreshments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":155.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":163.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":168.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":174.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":191.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":199.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":206.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.66,"local_amount":257.19,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":263.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456357},{"amount":55.63,"local_amount":143.57,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":147.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452018},{"amount":58.78,"local_amount":151.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":155.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447191},{"amount":60.36,"local_amount":155.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053092},{"amount":63.54,"local_amount":163.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":168.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188027},{"amount":65.48,"local_amount":168.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":173.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572016},{"amount":67.69,"local_amount":174.68,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":179.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121811},{"amount":155.2,"local_amount":400.51,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":411.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867731},{"amount":148.66,"local_amount":383.64,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":393.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576700}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T14:57:06Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Connelly","image":1230042}},{"id":448238,"name":"Jose Edilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jos\u00e9 Edilio tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en  una Colonia suburbana de San Pedro Sula junto a su conyugue y sus 6 hijos.\nEl tiene m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a realizar esta actividad de reparar y vender Marimbas musicales y vaquetas y de hacer presentaciones musicales en orquesta.

Bernarda is a mother of three children and she lives together with them and her long-term partner.\r\n\r\nBernarda started her association with Esperanza because she needed to reinvest in her business. She sells underwear, both wholesale and retail, to her clients. Bernarda has operated her business for around five years now and began it with savings she had. She is very excited to be receiving her fifth Esperanza Internacional loan.

This is where she has her business, which is selling cosmetics. She is separated and has 2 sons. She has been involved in commercial activities since she was very young. Marisol started this business 4 years ago: her way of working involves collecting orders and then fulfilling them. Quite recently, she started selling clothes, since her customers asked for them. Marisol sells her products every day by herself, going to various parts of her city. She offers her products by showing them in a catalogue or bringing samples; in general, she always uses the latter method for clothes, as that way the customers can try them on and buy them. Until now, Marisol has not encountered any particular difficulties in her business, and she hopes to continue in this manner. With the loan she asks for, she will buy perfumes, creams, make-up products, jeans, and shirts. Marisol's dreams are to have her own house, since she lives in a rented one, and to have a perfume shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1137453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, creams, make-up products, and clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Milagro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T20:00:05Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":843.07,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":85.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":88.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":155.28,"local_amount":154.01,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":155.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340419},{"amount":79.99,"local_amount":79.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096790},{"amount":82.27,"local_amount":81.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":82.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331146},{"amount":83.69,"local_amount":83.01,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939789},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":85.23,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":85.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072209},{"amount":87.57,"local_amount":86.85,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318567},{"amount":89.56,"local_amount":88.83,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":89.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013312},{"amount":91.88,"local_amount":91.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453674},{"amount":93.83,"local_amount":93.07,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":93.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459522}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T19:49:09Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":450007,"name":"Nonvilele Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"NONVILELE est un groupe constitu\u00e9 de trois personnes et dont la pr\u00e9sidente (celle qui a le doigt lev\u00e9 sur la photo) est nomm\u00e9e Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9.

Its leader (the one raising her finger in the photo) is Marie  Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9. The group members know each other because they live in the same neighborhood of Benin. With the goal of expanding their working capital, the group members are seeking a loan from Alid\u00e9. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 is married. Her husband\u2019s name is Simon. They have four dependent children, all in school. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 lives together with her husband and children. The spouses jointly provide for family needs. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 sells fabric out of her home and as  street vendor. She stocks up in a region of Benin. She  has 10 years of experience in this line of business already. This is the third time that Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 and her group are seeking financing from Alid\u00e9. This loan will allow Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 and the other members of the Nonvilele group to expand their business by  enlarging their stock and increasing their customer base and their revenues. The two prior loans have been duly repaid."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1140849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Se\u00efmi Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":116000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118285.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326580},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083627},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318015},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926591},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059509},{"amount":111.71,"local_amount":58900,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":60060.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449468},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347002320},{"amount":111.88,"local_amount":58991,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T08:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":60153.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355744680},{"amount":106.41,"local_amount":56109,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":57214.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364449234}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T19:08:54Z","paid_date":"2013-07-22T08:34:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":450243,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 44 years old and married with seven children.

Despite being very close to the snow-covered mountain, Latacunga\u2019s average temperature is 12\u00b0C and has a moderately cold climate.  It is one of the most important cities in the Ecuadorian mountains thanks to the sustained development it\u2019s had since the beginning of the 21st Century.  At present, Latacunga has approximately 63,842 inhabitants.  Its climate as well as its geographic and atmospheric conditions has allowed flower growing to flourish and to become the economic motor and an important generator of income for the Ecuadorian Central Mountains\r\n\r\nMining is another activity that supports Latacunga.  Limestone and cement extraction, the growth of heavy and light metallurgy industry, agribusiness and the very well-known dairy and cattle industries have made this city into one of the cities in Ecuador that promises extraordinary advances.  It has its own international airport and impressive urban development with large markets and centers of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful city lives Luis, a 37-year-old entrepreneur who has taken advantage of Latacunga\u2019s growth to strengthen his business.  Five years ago \r\nLuis decided to open a vehicle repair shop noting that Latacunga is a city with much traffic not just of light vehicles but also trucks, dump-trucks and cargo hauling trucks which generate quite a large clientele.\r\n\r\nLuis works almost ten hours daily every day in his shop and returns time to spend family time with his three children and his wife, Mar\u00eda, 25.  He believes that customer service and efficient, effective work is the key to a good business and he hopes his business will be stronger thanks to these values.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, an institution through which Kiva can finance various enterprising people.

In spite of being very close to the snow, Latacunga has an average temperature of 12\u00b0C (54\u00b0F) and a mild-to-cool climate.  It is one of the most important cities of the equatorial sierra, thanks to the sustained development which started at the beginning of the 21st century.  Currently Latacunga has around 63,842 residents.  The climate, along with not only the geographic conditions, but also the atmospheric conditions, has permitted the flower-growing industry to grow and become the economic engine of the region and bring in substantial foreign currency to the Central Sierra of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nMining is the other activity that sustains Latacunga.  The extraction of limestone and concrete, heavy and light metallurgy, agro-industry, and the well-known dairy and livestock industry have all enabled this city to become one of the many Ecuadoran cities that hold the promise of extraordinary growth.  The city now has its own international airport and impressive urban growth, complete with large markets and commercial centers.\r\n\r\nIn the tranquil parish of Eloy Alfaro we find Cecilia, an enterprising mother who fights every day to give the best to her family.  For three years she has been providing beautician services.  She spends roughly four hours each day in her work, since afterward she has to take care of her family.  She travels from home to home to perform this week.  She lives with her two children and her husband Juan, who is 44 years old.  He helps with the household expenses and earns his living as a private guard.  \r\n\r\nAt her 38 years, one of the obstacles that Cecilia has had to overcome is to start her business and do all that is necessary to maintain it so that it will function and grow as she wants it to.  To position oneself in the market is difficult, but she hopes that with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, an institution that works with Kiva, she will be able to buy beauty products and supplies and thus be able to improve her service and have more clients.  In the future she hopes to be able to open her own beauty salon and thus improve her income.  She wants to provide the best for her family and be able to improve their quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1135101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T23:50:05Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":853.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":67.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":73.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":75.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":76.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":450270,"name":"Avtandil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avtandil is 54 years old.

She is a very hard-working and dedicated woman. She is married to Ciro, who is a farmer. She lives together with her husband and her children, aged 9 and 4, whom she loves very much. The house where they live was inherited from her parents. \r\n\r\nHer work is growing fruits and vegetables of the region, such as pineapples, limes, oranges, tomatoes and others, as well as selling fresh fruits. For this, she has a stand in the market of her town. She has been working in this business for more than 12 years, with the support of her husband and two laborers to plant and harvest her crops. She likes her business, because she is accustomed to this work, since she learned it from her parents. She also likes the income, which allows her to cover the expenses of her household and her children's education. On the other hand, she doesn't like the physical tiredness that comes after a long day of work. For this reason she takes rest periods of up to two days and then returns to her business. Her desire is to have more income in order to diversify her crops. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution, and she feels happy about the opportunity to have a line of credit to move forward with her business. She also feels good about her communal bank, since she considers the members to be friendly and responsible people. \r\n\r\nWith the amount she is requesting, 1000 Peruvian new soles, she will invest in paying her laborers to cultivate her land, to harvest her products (limes, pineapples and mandarines, among others), and to transport them to the market.

is Erminia. She previously received a loan of 8,000 PHP. She used the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. Her earnings helped pay for some of her personal, house hold and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan of 10,000 PHP so that she can buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in the store, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. \r\n\r\nErminia hopes to expand her business soon and aspires to own her own home. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. She looks forward to this financial increase with a heart of happiness and thankfulness. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work each week.

Caribe; en esta poblaci\u00f3n de importante potencial tur\u00edstico  y pueblo de mucha paz, \u00e9l tiene una f\u00e1brica de bollos, o amasijo de ma\u00edz, envuelto con capachos, u hojas que protegen el fruto y al que en ocasiones agregan queso o an\u00eds, miel etc. Su experiencia data de hace 20 a\u00f1os y siempre contando con el apoyo de su esposa, quien le ayuda a preparar diariamente, los llamados bollos limpios, al que solo le agrega masa de ma\u00edz natural, productos muy saludable ,porque no contiene conservantes, saborizantes artificiales. Los principales acompa\u00f1antes de este producto son las tortillas de huevos, chicharrones, pescado frito y justamente los principales clientes de  estos productos, son los negocios que se dedican a la venta de alimentos o restaurantes y amas de casa cuyas familias lo consumen a la hora del desayuno principalmente. La Jornada de trabajo de Jes\u00fas, comienza a las 3:00 a.m. con la molienda, armado, cocci\u00f3n y finaliza con la distribuci\u00f3n  de los bollos aun calientes, con los que transita por las polvorientas calles del municipio. Actualmente Jes\u00fas est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 ma\u00edz en un mayor volumen, pues desea extender su mercado y necesita aumentar su producci\u00f3n, mientras sus indicadores financieros indican un importante potencial de crecimiento, ampliando su mercado, pues maneja un margen de utilidad no menor del 40% y sus materias primas rotan cada 5 d\u00edas, indicadores desde los que auguramos su crecimiento empresarial. Jes\u00fas afirma orgullosamente que su vivienda y todo lo que posee se lo debe a sus bollos, por eso quiere que cuando muera,  lo recuerden como el fabricante de los m\u00e1s exquisitos bollos que se producen en Puerto Colombia, municipio de Playa, brisa y mar, que es lo m\u00e1s lindo de la tierra linda, como lo afirma un canci\u00f3n que inspir\u00f3 a su autor en el Caribe.  ","en":"Jesus is 62 years old and lives in Puerto Colombia, a town located on the coast of the Caribbean Sea.  In this town of important touristic potential and  peacefulness, he makes bollos (a spongy bread roll made of corn) wrapped in leaves for protection which are occasionally flavored with cheese, anise, honey, etc.\r\n\r\nHis experience dates back 20 years, and he has always had the support of his wife who helps the daily preparation of the plain bollos.  They are made with natural corn flour and healthy products that do not contain preservatives or artificial flavors.  The bollos are typically eaten with egg tortillas, pork rinds, or fried fish.  The main customers of Jesus's products are businesses that sell food or restaurants and housewives whose customers and family eat them for breakfast.  \r\n\r\nJesus's daily schedule begins at 3:00 am with the milling of the corn, followed by the preparation and baking of the dough, and finally the distribution of the warm bollos through the dusty streets of the town.  \r\n\r\nPresently, Jesus is applying for his first loan from the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Mario Santo Domingo Foundation) with which he will buy corn in a larger quantity.  He hopes to extend his market, and he needs to increase his production as his financial indicators show an important potential for growth.  He maintains a profit margin of no less than 40% and his raw materials cycle every five days- indicators which foretell business growth.  \r\n\r\nJesus proudly asserts that his home and everything that he owns is owed to the production of his bollos.  That is why he hopes that when he dies, his business is remembered for the most exquisite bollos made in Puerto Colombia- town of the beach, breeze, and sea that is the loveliest of all the lovely earth, as affirms a song that inspired its author in the Caribbean.

She is married to Roberto and is the mother of their child. Together with her husband she manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAna operates a doormat business. Her products are small rugs and doormats. She makes doormats out of excess textile cloth she buys from the factory.
