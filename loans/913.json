She is single and lives with her parents and three siblings in their parents\u2019 home.\r\n\r\nShe works as a seamstress and makes clothing, which she learned from an educational center. With her savings, she was able to later on buy her own sewing machine and installed it on her home where her customers find her and buy her well made products. Patricia has been able to gain her customers\u2019 loyalty and is well recommended to people who later become regular customers. She does her sewing part time since in the mornings she works with a photocopier. She started that job with her mother more than 4 years ago. Patricia enjoys sewing since it is a trade and occupation that allows her to have some earnings that help her support her parents in paying the household expenses.

Furthermore, she is happy with her communal bank since she is in a united and helpful group.\r\n\r\nWith the 800 nuevos soles, Patricia will buy a mending machine that costs 380 nuevos soles; with the remainder she will buy sewing materials like fabrics, threads and other items in greater quantities to get lower prices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1137684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy a mending machine and buy sewing materials like fabrics, threads and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-17T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-16T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":122.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":143.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":149.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":122.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":131.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402082},{"amount":48.71,"local_amount":119.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":128.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456366},{"amount":53.71,"local_amount":132.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":142.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452028},{"amount":54.1,"local_amount":133.18,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":143.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447201},{"amount":58.23,"local_amount":143.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":154.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053102},{"amount":60.67,"local_amount":149.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":160.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188037}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T22:51:40Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":448646,"name":"Marta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta, solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para poder fortalecer el negocio, pues considera necesaria una nueva inversi\u00f3n en los materiales que le ayudan a mantener el negocio, gaseosas, arroz, quesillo, entre otros productos que son necesarios para poder atender a su clientela en la tienda y pupuseria.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayud\u00f3 a fortalecer el negocio y a poderle brindar mejores ganancias, para ayudar a su familia \u00e9stos le ha motivado a continuar trabajando de la mano de los pr\u00e9stamos pues considera estar mejorando su condici\u00f3n.\n","en":"Marta\u2019s asking for a new loan to strengthen the business because she feels that a new investment in supplies like soft-drinks, rice and cheese, among other products is necessary to meet customer demand in her store and \u2018pupusa\u2019 [stuffed, grilled corncakes] shop.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan helped her to strengthen the business and generate higher profits to help her family.

Andr\u00e9s says that in order to do his farm work he hires day laborers because he can\u2019t do all the work by himself because it\u2019s very hard work.  He earns additional income because he sells curd made from the milk his cows produce.  He sells his products in his own district in order to avoid transportation costs.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s requesting the loan to buy supplies and to pay labor costs to plant corn and beans.

The total average monthly income of the family is 550 Lari.\r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan to purchase fertilizer and repair the cattle shed. She plans to expand their dairy farm by adding additional cows, but the existing cattle shed doesn\u2019t allow her to implement this plan. After the building is repaired, Marina will be able to keep more cows there. Thus, she will be able to double the production and sales of cheese and the income of the family will significantly increase. Also, Marina will fertilize her agricultural land and will sow more maize. After fertilization and needed agricultural work she hopes to get a larger and better quality harvest. She hopes to sell the harvest for a good price. As a result the family will be able to create better living conditions for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1142758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

I was born in Tembisa as the youngest in the family. My parents are divorced and I live with my mother, who is the only breadwinner. My sister and I are both unemployed.\r\n\r\nNone of my siblings have basic matric (grade 12) schooling and I am the first to go to university. I cannot afford to pay the fees myself at the moment and for me and my family this presents a great struggle. Education is important for my individual success in life.

She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business 11 hours per day and 6 days per week. She also earns income from her elder son. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of capital to operate the business.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan in order to buy more milk, sugar, tea leaves, phone cards, sardines and bread.

She is married with 1 child, age 3 years. In 2005, Hawa established her provision shop business. After she finished her secondary school education she got married and started up this business. She works at the business seven days per week, and she is living in the shop with her husband and child. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and price inflation. \r\n\r\nHawa requires a loan in order to buy more eggs, cream, sweets, paste and biscuits. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to expand her shop and start a savings account. In the future, she plans to build a house and expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1142967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has been running this business for 5 years. She works at the business every day, 7 days per week. Her other source of income comes from small-scale farming. Margrette describes her major problem as lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan in order to buy more local goods such cassava grain and bag sugar. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to expand her business and try to see her children educated.

The couple has eight children who are all educated, two of whom are in their care. Jeanne lives together with her husband and her children. The couple takes care of the various household expenses. To this end, Jeanne has been selling food in a neighbourhood in Benin for 17 years. In addition to this activity, Jeanne also sells pasta. These business activities enable her to cater to her family's needs. She gets her supplies from her neighbourhood and from a market in Benin. In order to ensure customer satisfaction and increase her revenue and income, she is requesting her first loan from ALID\u00e9 together with the other members of the VAP4 group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1144190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-07-18T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-17T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"D\u00e9nass\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mahugnon Estelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yvette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ad\u00e8le","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mahugnon Mariette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pierrette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nafissath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lahanatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Val\u00e9rie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":564.29,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":301018.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326613},{"amount":282.14,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":150509.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083660},{"amount":282.14,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150509.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318048},{"amount":305.47,"local_amount":162400,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162951.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926624},{"amount":258.82,"local_amount":137600,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":138067.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059541},{"amount":282.14,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150509.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449497}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T16:50:36Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T09:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stella Hodkin","image":1680038}},{"id":450604,"name":"Edmundo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edmundo is an artisan who specializes in the traditional Peruvian art of reverse painted glass.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was eight years old, my father thought it was time for me to learn to weave on a floor loom, just like he did. My products are associated with the history of Guatemala; for example, our ancestors used to place tortillas in a square holder woven by women on a backstrap loom. Now, that same tortilla holder is used as a placemat or napkin. I have taught the art of weaving to more than 80 people, and now I dedicate most of my time to designing new colors with natural dyes, innovating weaving techniques, and supervising apprentices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to have this opportunity, as the loan will let me buy the materials I need to keep bringing my work to the weavers in my community.

She currently lives with just one of them, Cristian, age 23. The house where they live is rented.\r\n\r\nShe works providing tailoring services and making clothing. She has a small workshop which she set up in her home, where she installed her sewing machines. She learned this profession at a vocational education center, and she later started her business, buying a small machine and making garments for her friends and neighbors. She was able to make herself known and gain more customers, expanding her business and buying more machines to facilitate her work, thus improving her results. She has done this work for more than 16 years, with the help of a niece whom she pays by the week for her work. What she likes about her work is that it lets her use her talents in a profession she enjoys, since she likes coming up with new designs, and she also likes serving her customers. She has plans to expand the space dedicated to her business, and in the future to open a boutique in this same place. \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 5 for her with the MFP institution, and she feels grateful because in this way she will be able to move ahead with her business.

She is also happy and extroverted. She is separated from the father of her children. She now lives alone with them, Kensi is 25 years old and Tedsu is 18 years old. She has her own house, which she built on the land that she inherited from her father. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living preparing and selling food on the go like noodles, rice \"chaufa\", fried chicken, etc. She prepares everything during the day and then is posted in the front of her house. During the evenings her customers begin to arrive that are for the most part her neighbors and people passing by. She has been doing this work for more than 20 years and she currently counts on her sister for help in preparing food and attending to the customers. She gives her a daily pay. In this way she supports her with an income. She likes her work because she relies on the income to be able to cover the household expenses. In addition, she likes to cool, a skill that she learned thanks to her mother, who taught her when she way very young. The problem is the physical exhaustion that comes to her on long days since she remains open until very late in the night to sell everything she that prepared. She is conscious that it is her source of income and wishes to continue.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan she has with the MFP institution and she feels thankful for the financial support. She hopes to continue counting on more loans. Because of this she says that she will be punctual with the payment of her dues, as in the previous loans. In addiition, she likes the group that makes up her communal bank because she considers the members to be responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of wood to fix up her locale. She also needs tables and chairs. She will also replace her cooking utensils (plates, spoons, forks, glasses, and others).

She is also very happy and sociable.  Her partner is Rodolfo, with whom she has two children ages 24 and 13.  \r\n\r\nHer activity is the selling of clothes and shoes that she brings by request from the capital city, in order to then sell them personally to her neighbors and family.  Many times she sells them for cash, but she also offers a credit of 15 days.  She has worked in this activity for more than 8 years and what she likes the most is that it permits her to socialize with people, bringing them a good service with customer attention, and also being able to count on economic income, since the income from her partner is not sufficient and they have many needs.  For that reason she decided to work in this business and seeing the good results she has plans to continue and to make the volume of her merchandise and stock grow.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan that she has taken with the institution MFP.  In addition, she feels very good about her communal bank, since she considers it a very united and supportive group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, of 1500 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency), she will invest in the purchase of clothing of diverse styles and brands, in bulk, looking for low prices by volume for her purchases.  In this way she looks forward to celebrating the upcoming season of patriotic festivals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1138922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothing for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-18T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-17T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":230.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402088},{"amount":91.59,"local_amount":238.94,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":240.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456374},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":240.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452036},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":258.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447209},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":268.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053110},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":273.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188045}],"funded_date":"2012-07-28T15:33:13Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":450683,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorena is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Her community is populated by humble people who want to improve.  At the moment it already has electricity.\r\n\r\nThe activity she carries out is raising sheep, pigs and barnyard fowl to sell.  She raises her animals in her back yard.  When they develop sufficiently she sells them to area merchants and sometimes in the district market.  She\u2019s been in this business for about 7 years.  In addition, together with her husband she owns a parcel of land where they have planted mangoes and corn.  With income they both earn from these activities they support their family.\r\n\r\nRosa Aurelia wants to buy nutritionally balanced feed and grains at wholesale to improve her animals\u2019 nutrition; she also wants to make improvements to her corrals.

She and her husband are both garment factory workers, but they are employed in different factories and in different positions. Math works as a sewing staff, while her husband is an expert at repairing engines. They do not have any children, but they plan to start a family soon. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement the family\u2019s income, Math\u2019s husband wants to get involved in the used motorcycle business. He will purchase used motorcycles from local people at an acceptable price, and sell them to others at a profit.

He works about 10 hours daily and feels good doing his work as a watchman and he believes that he does well because he\u2019s esteemed for the good work he does and the kind way he treats others.\r\n\r\nDiego is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given him he will be able to add a room to his house since currently Diego and his family live in a little house made out of matting and sticks and during the winter when temperatures drop they are cold and suffer a lot because of the rain.  In this way, Diego will be able to offer more safety and wellbeing to his family and in the not too distant future he\u2019ll be able to have his house built completely.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1138981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He\u2019s been doing this since he was 16-years-old since he learned it from his parents.  \r\n\r\nAt first, he only worked as an assistant but when his wife abandoned him he decided to buy a machine and open his own business.  The decision was a good one because since then his profits improved and he\u2019s been able to provide security for his children.  \r\n\r\nHe set aside a room in his house where he installed his sewing machine and the cutting machine.  He also has some shelves to display the merchandise once it\u2019s finished.  He works every day and his two children help him in the morning because they attend school in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nHe will use the requested loan to buy leather and soles to make sandals.  Jorge has four children attending private school and his dream is to be able to help them with their university education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1139006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather and soles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-18T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-17T19:20:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Libardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.21,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":84.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":86.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159.88,"local_amount":156.64,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":159.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340426},{"amount":82.29,"local_amount":80.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096796},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":83.06,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331153},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":84.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":86.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939796},{"amount":88.56,"local_amount":86.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072216},{"amount":90.08,"local_amount":88.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":90.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318574},{"amount":38.07,"local_amount":37.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453681},{"amount":149.02,"local_amount":146,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":149.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459529},{"amount":195.34,"local_amount":191.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":195.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087859},{"amount":100.88,"local_amount":98.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632045}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T08:00:42Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":450742,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is married and has 3 children.

She lives together with her family in the Bakiyan village in the north of Kyrgyzstan.  Just like many others in rural areas, to provide the primary source of income, Shaarbubu fattens up livestock, having started this business in 2002.  Today her business contains 27 sheep, one cow, and 3.60 hectares of land with beans, which allows her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) in profit per month.  In order to further develop her business, Shaarbubu requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy work horses.

Thanks for Suksur's hard work, today her business contains four dairy cows with offspring, and the monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 14,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Suksur requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry for 12 years, having started this business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS), spent on a purchase of a cow.  Thanks to Gamira's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and ten sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk amounts to about 15,000 som.  Unfortunately, her youngest daughter, Nurgul, is ill, and a large part of the business income goes toward her treatment.  In order to further develop her business, Gamira requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued expansion of her business and dreams of getting her daughter back on her

Adem\u00e1s, le gusta mucho el trabajo con su banco comunal, por lo que promete ser puntual con el pago de sus cuotas.  \nNilda invertir\u00e1 este dinero en la compra de sacos de arroz y az\u00facar, como tambi\u00e9n en la compra de bebidas y dulces al por mayor. ","en":"Nilda is 35. She lives with 3 of her 4 children in the house she bought two years ago in Yanamarca. For some years, she has been farming and raising livestock; however, a year ago she started to sell basic commodities in her grocery store. Every morning she opens the doors to her store to serve local residents. After a few hours, she closes the store and heads to her fields. While she and her neighbors tend the land, she also sells soft drinks, water, and juices. \"It's my stable income, since I've found a way to continue to sell. After 8 a.m., the residents of my town head out to care for their plantings, so they are not at home, and I use this opportunity to continue selling,\" she says. She wants to increase her capital to offer a variety of foods.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the communal bank \u201cLa rosa de Guadalupe,\u201d and this is her sixth credit cycle with MFP. She is grateful for the financial support all these years because she was able to manage her money and make it productive. She also likes working with her communal bank and promises to make her payments on time.

She relates that many years ago she used to sell ice-cream in the city of La Paz and the owner of that business taught her how to make these products so when she returned to her community she started her own business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting now is to increase raw materials.  She\u2019ll buy spices in the street markets in the city of El Alto and once the items are made she\u2019ll sell them in her local street markets.  This way of working makes it possible for her to generate resources to support her family the best way possible since she\u2019s married and has four children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that Pro Mujer isn\u2019t very demanding with respect to loan collateral.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":1139754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
