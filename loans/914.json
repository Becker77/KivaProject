A native of Riohaca, a city located in the department of Guajira, Belinda came to Barranquilla five years ago on the advice of her father to make a living in commerce and generate income to provide for her family. He gave her an iron, a hairdryer and a coffee maker, valued around $200 COP, so that she could find buyers and learn the market. With these items, she received orders and reinvested the capital. This first venture in business was very difficult, but little by little with a lot of hard work she was able to increase her sales and build a fixed clientele, which today carries a lot of weight on her loan portfolio. She hopes to sustain it in order to have the working capital needed to make purchases and keep her customers happy. It's for this reason she is requesting a loan, her first from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she plans to use to purchase sound equipment, irons and digital cameras, which are in demand, so she knows she will have success because her sales are assured. Her goal in the future is to improve the living conditions of her home, so as time passes her children will become more comfortable and secure in their own home. As this occurs she will continue working in her business to be able to achieve her dream of prosperity, with current indicators projecting a 19-percent gain on her investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1139789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sound equipment, irons and digital cameras.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-19T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-18T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belinda Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77412},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84492},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86463},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88481},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90545},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92658},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94820},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97032},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99296},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101613},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103984},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113204}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":77412,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79729.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395538},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":84492,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87021.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775324},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":86463,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":89051.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387326},{"amount":50.89,"local_amount":88481,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91129.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994151},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":90545,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93255.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130510},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":76174,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":78454.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071223},{"amount":64.02,"local_amount":111304,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":114635.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928038},{"amount":296.31,"local_amount":515129,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":530548.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083153}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T03:18:59Z","paid_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":449521,"name":"Carminia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia  es la se\u00f1ora Carminia, ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cCusco Sur\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco - Per\u00fa, nuestra socia suge con su negocio de tienda de abarrotes.

Out of her six children, she has three sons whose ages are over eighteen years, two of them are still in school, and the other helps support the family\u2019s business. To make a living, she and her husband have been farming rice on 1.5 hectares of farmland for almost thirty-five years, and her husband supplements the family\u2019s income by making palm juice. The current business earns her about 27,400 KHR per day. The main challenge for her is the small income earned to support her children\u2019s education until graduation. \r\n\r\nThis is the first microloan for Moeun\u2019s group of two with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. Now leading her group to apply for a loan of 1,000,000 KHR each, Moeun, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to buy a piglet as additional income. She hopes this loan will enable her to earn more income so as to make a better living and keep her children until graduation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1143664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-19T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-18T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1539375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265661},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":513125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837568}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T09:33:23Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":449535,"name":"Yovana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yovana tiene 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy carism\u00e1tica y trabajadora.

He lives with his wife, 41, and his daughter in his old house which is located in the slum district in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. <p>\r\n\r\nSince his house was built, it has not been renovated.  Every winter his family faces one big problem, that is of heat loss trough the wall and floor since the house is so old and not updated.   It  is detrimental to his family,  harmful to their health and costly due to the fuel expenses.  Therefore he has decided to insulate his house wall.   Insulating the house needs foam, cement and other building materials. <p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit a lot of pollution every night, from families just trying to stay warm.  In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on the natural gas.  The loan he is taking will be used to buy insulation materials to insulate his house walls to prevent heat loss.

She is 67 years old and a resident of Manila, Philippines. Her husband passed away, leaving her with three children, who are working already. She manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFlorenia operates a junk shop.  Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines.  While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Florenia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will add the money to her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from trash scavengers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlorenia hopes her business grows more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

All\u00ed practica una actividad comercial que le ha permitido generar ingresos que aumentan el bienestar de su hogar, porque vende calzado que trae desde Bucaramanga, una ciudad de Colombia reconocida por  la excelencia en su trabajo en cuero, materia prima del cual elaboran hermosos calzados, bolsos y art\u00edculos \u00fatiles para  damas caballeros e infantil, que generan una imagen de buen gusto y  distinci\u00f3n. Elba adem\u00e1s vende multiusos en tela, cuero, madera entre otros, productos que usualmente son comprados principalmente por las amas de casa de las familias, quienes son los principales clientes de ella.  Elba realiza sus ventas a cr\u00e9ditos pactados con sus clientes, de acuerdo a su capacidad de pago y esto es lo que hace que la inversi\u00f3n rote r\u00e1pidamente,  as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n que su creciente clientela aumente .

","en":"Elba is 56 years old. She is married and lives in the town of Soledad with her husband. They have three children between the ages of 27 and 34. The income from her business has allowed her to improve her family's living conditions. She sells shoes that she transports from Bucaramanga, a city in Colombia known for its high-quality leather goods. The leather is used to make beautiful shoes, bags, and accessories for women, men, and children. They are distinguished in appearance and in excellent taste. Elba also sells a variety of goods in cloth, leather, wood, and other materials; these are mainly purchased by the housewives who make up the majority of her customers. Elba sells her merchandise on credit, drawing up agreements with her customers according to their ability to pay. Her willingness to give credit means that her stock rotates rapidly and her customer base continues to grow. She is currently requesting a loan from Kiva, financed through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy men's shoes, since she has a large order that she'd like to meet but lacks the working capital to fill it. She must wait for her credit customers to make their payments in order to fill the order and increase her sales volume. As Elba works toward her goals, she has profits of at least 10%, liquidity of 31.8 to 1, and turnover of receivables of 45 days.

","en":"Deivis, 30, owns a furniture-making business.  He lives in the south of the city with his partner and their young children.  He hopes his children will study for professional careers.  Deivis learned the business from his father who, in turn, learned it from his and now he, Deivis, is heir to the family's 50-year tradition of making furniture.  He started in 2000, making and selling wooden furniture, kitchens, doors, etc.  Most of his customers are local people who have been referred to him by other businesses or people who were customers of his father before.  He is responsible for every aspect of the business, from buying materials to design and manufacture.   He collects 50% of the cost of an order when he receives the order and the other 50% when he delivers a final product.  He wants to improve his workshop so that it's both more productive and comfortable for him and his employees.  His immediate challenge is a lack of working capital.  He doesn't have enough cash to make a large fixed investment in the business and buy wholesale supplies of the materials he needs to operate.  He is applying for a Kiva loan that he will use partly to equip his shop and pay for routine maintenance and partly to buy bulk supplies of the materials he needs.  The investment will allow him to buy meet orders for the furniture that he has jointly designed with his buyers, orders that pay more than he can usually expect to make from regular orders.

He has a shoemaking workshop in the living room of his house with a sewing machine and a table for cutting leather.  He started his business as a game, learning how to make shoes.  However, over time he realized that he would like to start working privately.  He does not work alone but has two assistants who each have different duties.  He invests $2.30 into making his shoes and sells each pair for $5.50, making a profit of $3.20 which allows him to cover his costs and expenses.

Marcos has lived his whole live here and his business is transporting goods.  He is 38 years old, single, and doesn't have any children though he hopes to change this status in the future and find a nice woman who is interested in a hard-working man like himself.  Some years ago, Marcos used to own a fishing boat but some of his friends were robbed and they lost their boat and produce.  This kind of episode is what most worries those who work in this business.  Thanks to God, there was not a sad ending and Marcos was able to return home.  At that point he decided to buy a truck which he could use to transport the fishermen to the docks, towing their boats so that they can go fishing.  His work starts at 7 o'clock in the morning and he works until 6 o'clock in the evening, from Monday to Saturday.  Marcos will use his loan to buy four new tires for his truck as his current ones are worn and he doesn't want to have any accidents.  Over time, he hopes to improve the service that he provides by replacing his truck or making some repairs to it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1140024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

He would like to purchase wood and other raw materials for his work.\r\n\r\nGeorge has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:\r\n\r\nIn 1990, George settled in the Akuapim hills to begin training as a carver. By the time he graduated, he had become the real artist he always knew he was. Four years of careful training had not been undertaken for common standards. Not only did George's background knowledge of woodwork help him, but an inbred acumen contrived to bring to the surface a talented carver.

His house is located in Santiago, a district famous for its hot and welcoming climate ad for its agriculture, notably growing cotton, grapes, asparagus, beans and lima beans. Various agro-export companies can also be found here, offering many job chances in the district. Whenever he has some free time, Javier loves playing soccer with his friends and neighbors, and he also takes advantage of his free time to eat one of his favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cArroz con pollo\u201d (rice and chicken). Owing to his meager economic resources, he has succeeded in completing secondary education only, but he would have liked to study Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nJavier works day by day running his small activity: he drives tubular dunes buggies, a sort of carts used to drive tourists in the dunes of the Huacachina lagoon. He can daily tend to up to 25 customers, and he works around 10 hours a day. He thinks his job is going well because he is very responsible when driving and above all because tourism has greatly increased.\r\n\r\nJavier is deeply grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he will be able to make improvements to his house. He will repair his roof, now made of straw mats, and he will put tiling on the walls among other works.

","en":"Lourdes is 30 years old and has three children.  She lives with them in her parents home which is located in the town of Yanamarca.  \r\n\r\nFour years ago she began her business of buying and selling vegetables, grains and tubers.  Her mother, who is her partner, lives in the capital and Lourdes sends her the products so that she can sell them there: \"Each time that I obtain an order of foods, I send it to my mother in the capital so that she can sell it,\" she affirms.  During the harvest season is when she has to take advantage of the opportunities to their maximum, since the foods cost very little and she can obtain a better income.  Her work is very very good, since she purchases in bulk and it is then sold to smaller businesses that arrive at the largest markets in the country.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal banking group \"La rosa de Guadalupe\" and this is her sixth credit with MFP.

They also allow him to pay for his personal expenses in general. He got his start by working as an employee doing publicity for a nightclub. From that job he saved money, bought merchandise and began selling it among his acquaintances, neighbors and friends. His business gradually grew, and therefore he decided to leave his previous job and set up a fast food stall. He still works there on holidays and weekends from Friday through Sunday, and on the remaining days he works on his other business.

At the moment, Cody employs one other person besides himself to assist with his work load. Through the Accion Texas Inc. loan, Cody will soon hire a third HVAC specialist. \r\n\r\nUpon certification from the Federal Aviation Academy, where he learned to properly work on HVAC systems, Cody decided to open his own business for the freedom he would gain as opposed to working for a corporation. Though the academy offers more courses in aviation, Cody decided to work on an HVAC certification because the Texas heat will keep his business in demand. \r\n\r\nWhen starting his business, Cody realized he would need more funds to get on track with what he wanted to do. He then went to a bank to try to get a loan. The loan officer said he would not qualify and referred him to Accion Texas. \r\n\r\nThe Accion loan will help him gain more work than he can handle, Cody said. And that's a good thing! Without the loan, Cody said CW's A\/C Inc. would have grown much slower. What differentiates his business from others within the area is that \"I'm just honest with folks,\" Cody said.

This will allow her to earn a higher income, to provide her child with an education and for the new member of the family who will be born soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1130803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-07-20T01:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-19T01:10:19Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":58.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":61.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":73.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.5,"local_amount":89.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":89.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390833},{"amount":520.15,"local_amount":520.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":520.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383030},{"amount":390.35,"local_amount":390.35,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":390.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990114}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T14:04:05Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marina Romanisio","image":903469}},{"id":447288,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After losing a total of 95 pounds within five months on a Healthy People Co. Multinivel (multi-level marketing) diet, Myrna (left) and Alma (right) invested in the company. Registered as AM Healthy People Independent Distributor, with A and M representing their first name initials, the company helps people decrease blood pressure and body fat through 27 natural supplements customers may chose from based on their body's needs. Myrna says she decreased her blood pressure back to normal and lost 45 pounds. \"It was a healthy weight loss,\" she says. \n\nThe women opened a store to service the El Paso community through Healthy People products. Myrna and Alma's business began Oct. 2011 but was registered in January 2012. As the only employees, they plan to hire a cashier and delivery driver after a year and a half as they cannot afford to now. Until then, Myrna and Alma fill the vacant positions. \n\nMyrna learned of Accion through the NYSE Small Business Resource Tour. Upon approval, Myrna and Alma decided to purchase enough inventory to last for multiple months, and if need be, distribute to other Healthy People distributors. \n\nWith their low-priced products, Myrna and Alma offer extensive customer service by setting up assessments that follow their clients' progress and well-being every two weeks. \"We take the time to know our clients and what their progress is,\"  Myrna says. Without the Accion loan, Myrna says she would risk losing customers due to not having products. \n\nTo view all their products, visit Myrna and Alma's website at: www.amhealthypeoplecotx.com Also,

He lives in the marvelous city of Pucallpa.  Pucallpa is known for being a very beautiful city because it is located in the Peruvian jungle and hosts beautiful flora and fauna.  It is a city in which one can appreciate the wonders of nature and above all clear one's head of the city racket.  In addition, the local people are very friendly and generous.  When he has free time, Lucio very much likes to go for walks and above all to go to his church.  At times he also likes to eat one of his favorite dishes, delicious ceviche (one of Peru's national dishes, it is made with raw fish and lemon juice).  Because he had little money, Lucio only was able to go to school until his 4th year of primary school.  But he would have liked to be able to study at the university level.\r\n\r\nDay after day, Lucio works in this small business as a shoe repair-man.  He works around 10 hours a day and can take care of as many as 15 customers a day.  Lucio believes that work has been going well for him because he always works with a good attitude and lots of eagerness.\r\n\r\nLucio is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have offered, he will be able to make some improvements to his home.  His house is built of adobe, and he is going to add on a few rooms to rent out.

He makes part of his purchases on credit and the other in cash, at farms, public markets, wholesale suppliers, etc.  He has built a customer base around where he lives, which has a lot more market potential.  He also has kitchen equipment so he can offer fast food on weekends, giving him an extra income.  The only thing he needs for his new business is a hot dog cart.  This is why he is applying for a CrediKiva loan, his second through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He will use it to buy fish, groceries, cleaning products, sleepwear and a fast food cart.\r\n\r\nHe used the previous loan to have more liquidity to make his purchases in cash to get better discounts and increase his turnover.

From both these businesses, she is able to earn about 19,000 KHR (Khmer Riel, Cambodia's local currency). The main problems for her business are fruitless rice caused by the drought and the declining price of cassava. \r\n\r\nThis is Kong's second loan cycle. She leads a group of other two members; one is a newly-joined client and another is a third-cycled client. She has used the first loan successfully and managed to pay back already. The past loan has helped her to have a decent food and to support the daily basic needs of her household. Now, she is applying for 1,000,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her portion to buy rice seeds and fertilizers, and to pay the fees for plowing her farmland. She hopes to earn more income from her businesses and make a better living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1144719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice seeds and fertilizers, and to pay the fee for plowing her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-20T11:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-19T11:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sineang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2052500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640925},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":410500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940925}],"funded_date":"2012-07-21T11:10:50Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":451317,"name":"Christina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christina works hard to support her family.

She is a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. Her husband is Jesus, her business partner. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nAmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelia hopes to be able to expand the business soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

2, 3 & 4. Her group is located in the lush, rugged Samana peninsula, an area with a nascent tourism industry. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children. \r\n\r\nEnercida is excited to be taking her ninth loan with Kiva field partner Esperanza International, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and growing her business. She plans to use her portion of this group loan to invest in her cosmetic catalog sales business, and will buy products such as deodorant, body lotion, perfume, and makeup.  Enercida also plans to buy \"Paca\" (packages of second-hand clothing) to resell.\r\n\r\nEnercida plans to save some of her profits in order to be able to build a website for her business.  She wants to improve her business, and the well-known cosmetics company she works for encourages its sales representatives to have websites.\r\n\r\nAs a member of Esperanza, Enercida joined a borrower group that includes some of her very good friends.

She is married to Orlando, her business partner, and mother to their two children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnaliza operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. Analiza rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnaliza dreams of being able to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1144845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional computer units, spare parts and supplies needed in her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-20T14:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-19T14:10:12Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200.01,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3340.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303497},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5332.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356245},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4267.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4454.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114343},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3340.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350391}],"funded_date":"2012-07-20T16:45:24Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":451370,"name":"Saira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saira assists her husband financially by doing decorative embroidery.

As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizers, rice seeds and use a portion to pay the fee for harvesting. She hopes that this loan will enable her family to earn a good living and keep the children in school.
