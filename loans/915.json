Rosa is a single mother: she has a 15-year-old son to whom she is both mother and father because her husband has abandoned them.

In her free time Rosa likes eating one of her favorite dishes, the delicious \u201carroz a la cubana\u201d (rice with fried plantain and fried meat). Owing to her meager economic resources she has been able to study up to the third grade of secondary education only, but she would have liked to become a fashion designer, and for this reason she works very hard so that her son can become a better professional than herself.\r\n\r\nRosa works day by day in her sewing shop, creating clothes as well as making repairs. She works around 10 hours a day and she can tend to up to 20 customers per day. She thinks her activity is going well because she is very kind and she always loves what she does.\r\n\r\nRosa is deeply grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she will be able to make some improvements to her house such as putting a cement floor, reinforcing the walls and other works. In this way her house will be safer and her standard of living will improve, so that she will continue working and fighting to make her biggest dream come true: \u201cTo have a dressmaking factory of

She is married and has two children who are in her charge. She studied until the fifth year of secondary school. She has been selling natacamales (steamed corncakes, a popular Nicaraguan dish) for 3 years. She started her business with her own money, earned while working at her previous job, a restaurant in the community. At 28, she decided to set up her own business with this money in the house where she lives. This is her first business, which she runs successfully on her own, since she is not helped by anyone. Arely says that she is satisfied with selling natacamales because it is a profitable business: she makes money every day and has many returning customers. She asks for this loan to buy firewood, sweetcorn, meat, onions, potatoes, etc. These are all the ingredients needed to make natacamales and give them flavour. She says that the loan will help her because it will enable her to invest in her inventory, increase production, and obtain a better income for her family. Her plans for the future include having her own home to be able to have a better standard of living and be independent. Her next goal is to establish her business in other places in the community, since she would like to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in her area in order to increase her earnings and be able to give her children a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1140915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Despite the fact that they both work and have a stable income, the family has not been able to save money to build their home.  They need to build additional rooms for their sons because they have grown up and will soon be married.  Gavhar and her husband decided to request a loan from us for these expenses.

Of course, everyone in the family works and earns an income, but still the family resources are only enough for basic living expenses.  It is impossible to save money, and this is why Zarrina requested a loan from our organization in order to cover large expenses.  She used her first loan to make repairs to her apartment before her sons' weddings and repaid that loan timely.  Then, she obtained a loan for the wedding.  Zarrina is requesting this loan also to hold events.  She has an adult daughter and plans to marry her off, and needs to buy a dowry and gold jewelry for this purpose.

He opened his shop in his home, located in the Orqu\u00eddeas sector north of Guayaquil.  He learned from his older brother, who works in the same business.  He began as a helper until little by little he continued learning and was able to achieve independence.  Currently he works from Monday to Saturday from 8am to 6pm.  He works with a helper since he needs one for the cutting and assembling of the pieces since they are fragile.  He has been working in the business for 10 years and he counts on many clients who like his work.  Ludit is married and has two children who study in school.  With the loan he is going to buy aluminum, pressed glass, rubber and adhesive which he will use to make windows.  He hopes in the future to grow his shop, improving his quality of life.  His dream is to be able to buy a car that will permit him to give better service.

In her neighborhood she has access to services for water, electricity and sewage.  She has lived in this area since she was able to acquire a loan for the purchase.  Rosa began her commercial life selling something similar to lottery tickets (cadenas de dinero) to family and friends.   She was able to take care of many of her bills in this way.  After several years of this type of work she was able to collect enough capital that she was able to buy clothing to sell, since this seemed to her a very marketable business.  She completes her sales between 8am and 3pm, traveling through various neighborhoods and visiting her clients since her business is informal.  The things that she sells include blouses, pants, and undergarments for both men and women.  She obtains a commission of $4 for every product she sells.

She is a very nice lady and the mother of two children: 13-year-old Yemilet and 7-year-old Frank.

She set up her store in a large space in her home and this is where she greets her customers who she loves chatting to.  In addition to selling pi\u00f1atas, she also sells all kinds of items for children's parties such as balloons, party hats, etc.  She has been in this business for more than three years and, during this period, she has become well known for her good-quality service.  Before she started this business she used to work for other people, making pi\u00f1atas.  That work did not make her good income.  Her current business, however, is going very well and, in common with all entrepreneurial women, she has aims and dreams which she would like to fulfill.  However, for now she is focusing on continuing in her business so that she can continue putting together enough money to expand it.\r\n\r\nThis is Nilda's fourth loan from MFP and she hopes to be able to carry out her plans.

She and her partner, Moises, a merchant, have four children.  They live in a house that they scrimped and saved to buy.\r\n\r\nLoida operates a corner grocery where she sells the everyday products that her customers want.  She used her own savings to start the business 4 years ago and operates it now from a space in her house.  She saw that there was demand for a grocery in the neighborhood and she's grown it with MFP loans.  Her son helps her with the business.  She tells us that she likes owning her own business because it provides an extra income for paying household bills and making improvements to her house.  Her biggest problem is the weather.  Rain is common here and the roads turn to mud when they're wet, something that makes access to her store difficult.  She never lets problems get her down, though.\r\n\r\nThis is Loida's fourth MFP loan and she says that she is grateful for your support because it will help her to carry on her business.  She is committed to repaying this loan in the agreed-upon time, just as she's done with past loans.  Loida will use your 4000-soles loan to buy bulk supplies of the products she sells--rice, sugar, cooking oil, pasta, etc.--so that she can get them at the lowest cost.

Her partner is 48-year-old Justo and the couple have three children: 15-year-old Iv\u00e1n, 11-year-old Ximena and 1-year-old Saori.  They live together in her in-laws' home.\r\n\r\nSulejka's business is selling fast food such as salchipapas, fried chicken, fried rice, etc.  She makes her sales outside her home.  She starts work very early in the morning, going to the market to find the best ingredients.  Once home again, she starts preparing her delicious dishes which have become very well known in her neighborhood.  She has been in this business for more than two years and she works with the help of her sister.  She considers her business to be profitable because it makes her good income.  Before this, she used to work for other people and had a lot of problems because she didn't make good income and always had difficulty in meeting some of her household expenses. However, she decided that it was the right time to start her own business and become independent.  She is now doing much better and would like to continue growing her business.  She would like to become a prosperous businesswoman.\r\n\r\nThis is Sulejka's sixth loan from MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support because it makes her feel secure in making progress in her business.  She pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.  She is very happy to belong to her community bank because all the members are very friendly and supportive.\r\n\r\nSulejka will use the 1,000 soles she has requested to buy ingredients for preparing some of her dishes.  She will buy potatoes, oil and other supplies in bulk.  This will allow her to continue in her business.  She also needs to refurbish some tables and chairs in order to provide her customers with a better service."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1141033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and ingredients for making food.

She is a woman who has always worked hard to do well in life.  Her partner is Luis, a motor mechanic.  The couple have five children who are already grown up and live independently.  Esther currently lives in her own home together with her partner, two of her daughters and one of their partners.\r\n\r\nEsther works as a dressmaker.  She designs clothing and sews to order.  Her work is very much in demand in her neighborhood as she is the only person who does this work.  She learned the business from her mother at a very young age and also studied at a vocational center.  She now has her own workshop.  Esther started out with one sewing machine more than 44 years ago and has been working alone up to now.  She still recalls that when she started out she had a lot of doubts and difficulties but, thanks to her efforts and hard work, she was able to make progress.  In addition, she also rents out rooms and commercial premises.\r\n\r\nThis is Esther's 17th loan from MFP and she hopes to continue achieving her goals.

It was built in the early 1990\u2019s with uninsulated brick walls. In winter, his house becomes very cold and his children always get sick due to the cold. Because his house has a heat-loss problem, it costs him a lot to buy coal fuel every winter. In Mongolia winter is severe and freezing cold. Most of the households in the ger districts use coal and other kind of toxic fuels such as used tires, shoes, etc. As you know it is extremely harmful to peoples' health, the environment, and the air around the cities. As a result, Dorjpalam decided to put insulation in the walls of his house before this coming winter. Recently, the Mongolian government and many other people, institutions, and enterprises have been caring and starting some projects to decrease air pollution in the cities. The loan he is requesting will be used to buy bricks and foam to put insulation in the walls of his house. In addition, his co-workers and friends will support him in this project.

He is the father of two children whom he loves so much and for whom he has worked very hard to help them get ahead and become people of means.  When Pablo has free time he enjoys reading above all because it distracts him from the worries of each day.  Also, as a good Peruvian, he really enjoys eating one of his favorite dishes, which is the delicious \"Adobo.\"  Due to his few economic resources, he was only able to complete high school, but he would have really liked to study to be an engineer.\r\n\r\nDay after day Pablo works as a farmer on his small plot of land in which he has planted garbanzo (chick peas).  He dedicates around 7 hours a day to his crop since he always watches over it so that his plantings are well watered and also so that no disease enters.  He believes that all is going well in his work because he is very dedicated and because he always works with great effort.\r\n\r\nPablo is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to the help that they have offered, he will be able to purchase compost and fertilizers for his crop, enabling him to obtain a good harvest.

She lives in the city of Ica with her young 9 year old son. Unfortunately, for various reasons she has been separated from her husband for many years. She has to act as both mother and father to her little one. She is friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic. She dedicates all her efforts to getting herself and her son ahead in life. Thanks to the support of her parents, who have always been at her side, Fanny was able to study the professional career of nursing. Unfortunately, due to the need to work and pay her bills, she has not been able to use her profession. She would like to be able to work as a nurse. In her free time, she likes to dedicate some of her time to reading. Sometimes she cooks up a delicious Aj\u00ed de Gallina [shredded chicken with peppers and sauce] to share with her family. \r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work, and thanks to the support of her family, Fanny works day after day, starting early in the morning as a ticket seller at a transportation company in her city. She works about 12 hours a day, and can attend to about 75 customers. She enjoys the work and her bosses regard her highly because of her diligence and friendly treatment. \r\n\r\nFanny is thankful for the Kiva loans.

She is a happy woman eager to succeed. Her partner is Tedy, who works in construction. He is the father of her two children, Elizabeth who is 16 years old and Marcos who is 14 years old. They live together in the house they built on land that was inherited from her mother.\r\n\r\nHer activity is making clothing and lingerie. She learned this profession by watching her youngest daughter when she had school work. Later she decided to study and to buy a sewing machine with her savings. Six months ago she set up at home and since then she is looked for because of the quality finish of her work. Also, she provides home service of cosmetology, pedicures, manicures, and hair dyes.\r\n\r\nShe likes the sewing business because she enjoys it and she can help her partner pay the household expenses. But she says that it is uncomfortable having to be seated in one position, which causes back pain, but this does not discourage her and she continues working and struggling.

Lessons from her grandmother and mother led to the opening of her start-up restaurant, \"Soul Heaven Caf\u00e9\". After conducting customer research, Lillie leased a building in her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, that\u2019s surrounded by multiple businesses where soul food has little competition other than a couple of nearby fast food restaurants.\r\n\r\nBesides her knowledge of cooking from scratch from her family, Lillie worked for a major Italian chain restaurant that sent her to culinary school. She also managed multiple restaurants. She says corporate always wants what\u2019s best for it rather than the customer. \u201cWhat I have learned from managing other businesses is you have to jump through hoops. It\u2019s not about the customer, it\u2019s about the dollar,\u201d she says. Lillie plans to do just the opposite with her restaurant. She is starting out small to ensure she can properly cater to customers\u2019 needs. When she opens in the middle of July, her restaurant will be the only one in her area offering made-from-scratch breakfast before 11 a.m.\r\n\r\nSince her business is a start-up, Lillie is the only employee. The restaurant is modeled after a take-out establishment, but can comfortably sit 15 hungry customers. She says Soul Heaven Caf\u00e9 will create four new jobs when it kicks off, but, for the time being, she\u2019ll receive help from family when needed. Lillie\u2019s menu will consist of a variety of dishes, including chef salad, chicken salad, grilled or fried chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches, vegetables, fruits, wings, and homemade cakes and puddings. She will also offer daily specials and party platters. \r\n\r\nTo get started, Lillie needed more kitchen equipment. But knowing she might not qualify for a loan, she purchased cooking equipment progressively until she inquired about a loan. Lillie says she did a quick Google search for loans in her area and came across Accion Texas Inc. However, she didn\u2019t follow through with an application until the Alabama Women in Business organization encouraged her. The Accion loan will help her business flourish, as she is able to purchase equipment and offer more menu choices, she says. Without the loan, it would have taken Lillie longer to open. \u201cI would like to thank Accion for believing in my dreams and helping me achieve my dreams.\u201d She is currently in the process of obtaining the domain name for her future website, but has a Facebook page for now: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Soul-Heaven-Cafe\/203786046407460.

She and her husband started it together after he left the passenger transportation cooperative at which he worked, and using the settlement he got and a bit of money they had saved they opened the business.\r\n\r\nIt was a good option since he knows about cars and spare parts. Now it's doing well despite competition. Clemencia focuses more of her attention on the public and dealing with suppliers. She opens the store every day Monday through Saturday from 8 in the morning until 6 at night.\r\n\r\nClemencia's dream for the future is to be able to open a restaurant in downtown Quevedo. This is underway because she wants to start a new business that's independent of her husband's."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1141081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bolts, keys, filters and car accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quevedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-21T17:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-20T17:00:07Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clemencia Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1556.98,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":112.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":122.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":130.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":143.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.56},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":232.33,"local_amount":229.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":232.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340438},{"amount":120.74,"local_amount":119.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":120.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096808},{"amount":124.39,"local_amount":122.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331165},{"amount":126.34,"local_amount":124.89,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":126.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939808},{"amount":129.93,"local_amount":128.45,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":129.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072228},{"amount":132.19,"local_amount":130.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":132.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318584},{"amount":135.19,"local_amount":133.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":135.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013329},{"amount":139.94,"local_amount":138.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":139.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453692},{"amount":140.61,"local_amount":139,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":140.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459539},{"amount":293.34,"local_amount":289.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":293.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087869}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T16:03:55Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Mensing","image":1262663}},{"id":451820,"name":"Bebialen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebialen, age 24, prepares and sells barbecue to earn a living.

Empez\u00f3 hace 20 a\u00f1os ya que siempre le gusto la confecci\u00f3n de ropa y con esta actividad pod\u00eda cuidar de sus hijos sin ning\u00fan tipo de problemas. Realizo varios cursos para conocer las t\u00e9cnicas y con un dinero ahorrado compro una m\u00e1quina de coser la cual es la misma que la acompa\u00f1a hasta hoy en d\u00eda. La confecci\u00f3n la realiza sola, dependiendo de la cantidad de trabajo que tenga que entregar si es mucho contrata a una amiga pag\u00e1ndole por horas. Jacinta tiene 7 hijos pero todos son mayores de edad e independiente, vive \u00fanicamente junto a su esposo quien labora en una empresa privada. Con el cr\u00e9dito que est\u00e1 solicitando va a comprar telas, botones, cierres, encajes, cintas e hilos. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es poder comprar maquinas industriales y abrir un taller en su domicilio con personas a su cargo.

She lives in an area known as Isla Trinitaria, and says that she's lived there her whole life. She isn't thinking of moving, despite the fact that it has become dangerous, because her clientele is in that part of the city.\r\n\r\nShe started 20 years ago since she always liked making clothes, and with this activity she could take care of her children without any sort of problem. She took various classes to get to know the techniques, and with some savings she bought a sewing machine which is the same one she uses to this day.\r\n\r\nShe does the fabrication by herself, depending on the amount of work she has to do. If it's a lot she contracts a friend, paying her by the hour.\r\n\r\nJacinta has 7 children but they are all grown up and independent. She lives only with her husband, who works at a private company.\r\n\r\nWith the credit she is requesting, she is going to purchase fabric, buttons, zippers, lace, ribbon and thread. Her greatest dream is to be able to buy industrial machines and open a workshop in her home with people working for

She hopes this loan will enable her to increase the crop yield so as to make a better living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1145949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and rice seeds for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-21T21:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-20T21:20:09Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savoeun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roeurm","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prouch","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":509375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197004}],"funded_date":"2012-07-22T02:27:07Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy and Andy Gordon","image":1110260}},{"id":451894,"name":"Dulamsuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dulamsuren is 25 years old and lives in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, with her dad and brother.

Two of her children are staying with her and helping the family's business. To feed the entire household, she has been planting watermelons and corn as her main business. Additionally, her husband helps in increasing income by growing paddy rice, raising cows and fishing. Hort has been in this business for 35 years and can earn about 47,500 KHR (Khmer Riel, Cambodia's local currency). Last year's flood and the drought from the first quarter of this year have been the main challenges for her, causing her crop yield to decline. \r\n\r\nHort has joined VisionFund five times already. The previous loans, which she completely paid back, have enabled her to stabilize her standard of living. Now she is leading a group of three to request a new loan.

and a mother to her children. She and her husband and children manage their household while operating their businesses. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nTrinidad operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not just a family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Trinidad is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to buy more quantities of meats, rice, vegetables, condiments,  seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nTrinidad dreams of growing her business and being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work. She also hopes to have her own restaurant someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
