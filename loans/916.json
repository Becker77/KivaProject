El trabajo es independiente y en la investigaci\u00f3n que realizo le pareci\u00f3 rentable, empez\u00f3 vendiendo bajo el c\u00f3digo de otra persona pero esto no le ayudaba ya que quien ganaba las promociones por vol\u00famenes de venta era su amiga. Cuando pudo reunir dinero para capitalizarse se acerco a la empresa y se registro con su propio c\u00f3digo. El trabajo lo realiza sola haciendo recorridos y visitando a sus clientes ya sea para cobrar o entregar y recoger pedidos. Su horario normalmente es desde las 9:00 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 11:00 y luego sale a las 15:00 hasta las 17:00 realiza este intervalo porque regresa a casa para atender a sus hijos.

She chose this work because she wanted to help her husband with expenses and, as she has two small children to care for, she was not able to work for a business. She could work independently in this area and, in the investigation she conducted, it seemed to her that it was profitable. She began selling under another person\u2019s account, but this did not help because it was her friend who won the sales promotions based on sales volumes and not her. When she was able to accumulate enough money to capitalize her own business, she went to the company and was registered with her own account. \r\n\r\nShe works alone, traveling to visit her clients either to collect money or to take and deliver orders. Her schedule is normally from 9 in the morning until 11 a.m. and then she leaves again from 3 until 5 in the afternoons,  The interval at home allows her to take care of her children. Erika sells products such as makeup, lipsticks, etc., which she buys on a margin of 30% of sales. She lives in Las Orquideas and her husband works as a driver for a tourist agency. She will use the loan to buy products such as perfume, makeup, clothing and footwear and expects to earn more profit when she sells them. In the future she hopes to be able to have a better established business and thus help more with household income.\r\n

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory, and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to have her own house and that her children will have a good quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

Jemmianus prefers to work by himself when he gets a small order i.e. to build up a room or renovate a small part of a house, etc. Jemmianus cannot deny that the income from being a mason is very limited in meeting the needs of his family; on the other hand the limited number of mason tools has also been an obstacle for him in getting larger orders.  \r\n\r\nJemmianus has a dream of improving his income by purchasing more mason tools i.e. a ripsaw, a hacksaw, a hammer, etc.  By having more tools Jemmianus will be able to receive many orders. He also would like to purchase several building materials to continue building his house. To make it happen, Jemmianus requested a loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. He is hoping that the loan assistance would enable him to reach his dream.

She is married and has three children: Genesis, 12, Melany, 9, and Kelly, 8, who attend school. The neighborhood where Miryen lives was established only recently so her house is made of cane and she has only electric light service. She gets water from tankers who sell to residents. She is dedicated to making scarves for all kinds of events, flags and selling beauty products from catalogs. She started the business five years ago when her husband lost his job and she found the need to start a business and saw the opportunity to work in something that she liked and earn money. One of the advantages of her business is that in her area no one else has this business. Miryan works alongside her husband at home since customers come to request the scarves with the logo that they wish in order to start the fabrication.

This area was founded by people lacking resources, who settled in the uninhabited area. Today it is one of the most popular areas and is constantly growing. This is where Cleotilde lives. She is a fighter, and has raised her six children as a single mother. \r\n\r\nCleotilde has a recycling business, which she started 10 years ago after she left her job as a janitor in a public school. She chose this type of work because it allows her to take care of her children and manage her time. She says that it is cost effective and she uses mostly human material which considerably reduces her costs. In the time that she has had her business, she has been able to raise enough capital to buy several tricycles which she lends to others who do the work, as she is more of an intermediary and buys the recycling by weight and then sells it on to larger processors. \r\n\r\nCleotilde's business has grown considerably in recent years thanks to the government's campaign for a greener country. The loan she is requesting will be used to capitalize and to continue to buy recycled material from her suppliers. In the future, she hopes to buy a truck to make her business more mobile.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1143144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase

Her dream for the future is to buy her own home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1143159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy blouses and underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-22T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-21T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":78.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":80.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":86.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":94.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160.56,"local_amount":157.3,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":160.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340445},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":80.57,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":82.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096815},{"amount":84.72,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331172},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":84.3,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":86.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939815},{"amount":88.49,"local_amount":86.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072235},{"amount":90.03,"local_amount":88.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318591},{"amount":92.07,"local_amount":90.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":92.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013336},{"amount":94.64,"local_amount":92.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":94.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453699},{"amount":296.21,"local_amount":290.2,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":296.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459546}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T13:09:29Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":450645,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio Francisco naci\u00f3 en el departamento de Apur\u00edmac pero vive en la hermosa ciudad del Cusco, \u00e9l tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene cinco hijos, \u00e9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLos Comerciantes De Virgen Asunta\u201d y le va muy bien gracias a los pagos puntuales de sus cuotas, \u00e9l se dedica a la venta de pasamaner\u00eda y artefactos.

Her partner is 42-year-old Carlos and the couple have three children: 15-year-old Gladys, 13-year-old Carlos and 6-year-old Luis.  They live in a house that they built on a plot of land that they owned.\r\n\r\nGladys' business is selling used electronics such as television sets and radios.  She also provides repair services.  Every day she opens her small premises in her home and waits for people to come and sell their used appliances which are damaged in some way.  She fixes these appliances and then re-sells them.  She has been in this line of work for more than seven years and works alongside her partner who carries out the repairs.  She feels very happy with her work because it allows her to make good income from home.  This means she is able to watch over and care for her children as she would like to.  At first, when they started out in the business, Gladys and her partner only had customers for their repair service.  However, over time, customers would leave their appliances with them and they would make them work again and then later sell them.  This is how they came up with the idea to start this business.\r\n\r\nThis is Gladys' second loan from MFP.  She pledges to make her repayments punctually and also hopes to be able to build a good relationship with the other members of her community bank.  She has heard very good things about them owing to the camaraderie and solidarity that exists among them.\r\n\r\nGladys will use the 1,500 soles she has requested to buy 20 appliances: used televisions and radios, which cost 50 soles each.  She will also buy spare parts which she needs to make the repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1143149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy 20 appliances to fix and sell, and to buy spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-22T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-21T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":231.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":237.19},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":255.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":265.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":272.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.74,"local_amount":231.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":233.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402104},{"amount":91.27,"local_amount":238.09,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":240.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456410},{"amount":90.92,"local_amount":237.19,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":239.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452073},{"amount":98.06,"local_amount":255.82,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":258.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447245},{"amount":101.72,"local_amount":265.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":267.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053145},{"amount":104.29,"local_amount":272.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":274.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188081}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T01:31:41Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":450637,"name":"Jose De Las Nieves","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es un hombre de 40 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Ica, en el distrito de Parcona con su amada esposa y sus 3 queridos hijos;

For now, her husband helps from time to time with manning the counter. Zoila considers her business to be profitable, since it generates a good income that enables her to pay for household expenses as well as help with her grandsons' education. Quite the opposite to their situation before starting her business, since the husband's income alone was not enought to pay for all the household's expenses. This loan is her ninth with field partner MFP. She is happy about having this opportunity to take out a loan in order to help her business move forward. Moreover, she feels at ease with her communal bank, because she thinks of the members as kind and responsible people. Zoila will invest the 2,000 new soles she asks for in buying more soft drinks and sweets in greater quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1143193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Compra de m\u00e1s gaseosas y golosinas para seguir vendiendo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-22T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-21T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":306.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":318.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":317.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":342.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":354.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":360.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":242.33,"local_amount":625.37,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":638.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456415},{"amount":122.92,"local_amount":317.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":323.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452078},{"amount":132.57,"local_amount":342.11,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":349.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447250},{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":354.87,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":362.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053150},{"amount":139.67,"local_amount":360.43,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":367.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188086}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T11:36:16Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":450654,"name":"Cinthia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cinthia tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena y amable.

She is married to Hildebrando, the father of her two children, who she raised and educated up to the moment they decided to be independent. Now she lives at her husband's side, who is 78 years old, accompanies her and with whom she shares happy moments. They have their own home which they constructed on the land that they bought together.\r\n\r\nLina's store is one of the busiest in her neighborhood, it is located in her home and she is always awaiting her clients to attend to them in a friendly manner. Her work begins when she gets up very early and she heads to the market in search of the various goods and groceries that she needs to sell in her store. It is because of this that her customers always go to her store, she has the most elementary and fresh goods of the day. She also sells diverse brands and flavors of soda. She began her business over 20 years ago and up to this moment she has always counted on the support of her husband. She enjoys her work a lot, she has fun and it goes very well. When she started she had some ups and downs, but over time she was able to overcome them and now she is very content. \r\n\r\nThis is her 19th loan that she has had with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support. This way, she will feel more secure continuing her work. She endeavors to, once again, complete the payment of her shares like with the prior loans. She likes being a part of her community bank, which she is happy to say she was a founding member of, and she supports all of its members who are responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the amount sought, 2000 nuevos soles, she will buy more merchandise and products to offer to her clients, like rice, sugar, milk, preserves, among others, as well as sodas, while seeking the lowest prices to increase her profit margin. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1143154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more groceries (rice, sugar, noodles, preserves, milk, etc.) for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-22T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-21T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":309.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":318.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":317.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":342.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":354.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":357.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.61},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":243.42,"local_amount":628.19,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":641.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456411},{"amount":122.98,"local_amount":317.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":323.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452074},{"amount":132.61,"local_amount":342.23,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":349.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447246},{"amount":137.56,"local_amount":354.99,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":362.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053146},{"amount":138.43,"local_amount":357.23,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":364.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188082}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T19:17:54Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":452117,"name":"Kassim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kassim has owned a retail shop since the year 2002.

Before I underwent my training to start running my own shop, I worked for a telecommunications store as a cashier. This taught me how to be responsible with money because I handled a lot of cash.  I believe that I will be able to bring the skills I learnt from my previous job to my own business.\r\n\r\nGetting the Kiva loan means that I will be able to set up my mobile money transfers shop. I will use the loan to buy the phones that I can use for transactions, some chairs so that my customers can have a place to sit. I will also use the money to brand my shop so that I can attract customers.\r\n\r\nI am very excited about starting my own business because I see it as a way to improve my economic status and that of my family. \r\n\r\nThank you Kiva lenders for having the heart to help other people by lending us money.

She has eight children, five of whom still need her support, as they cannot earn much money. Two of her dependent children are working for others for pay and some of the other children are still at school. Yum has been farming for 30 years on two and half hectares of farmland as her main source of income. She also plants watermelons, raises chickens, and works for others for a fee to earn additional income to support this big household. Her main challenge is the drought in the first quarter of this year that made her crop yield fruitless. To overcome this challenge, she formed a group of seven members who applied for a new loan. This is the fifth loan for Yum, the second loan for three of the members, the third loan for two of the members and the first loan for the last member. With success, Yum has managed to pay back all the past four loans and it has improved her living conditions so they are better than before. Now, she is applying for 1,300,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland and pay for harvesting fee. In addition, she is going to use some portion of the loan to buy 20 more chickens to raise. She hopes to earn more income from her current businesses so she can save some money to buy a new motorbike for her family to use."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1147292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer, pay the harvesting fee and buy more chickens to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Sampov Meas district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phuong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ton","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2350000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":897.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.96,"local_amount":850000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":853176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118633},{"amount":49.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":200747.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265692},{"amount":98.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":401495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640944},{"amount":430.21,"local_amount":1750000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1756540.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940944},{"amount":565.42,"local_amount":2300000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2308596.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046375},{"amount":122.91,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":501868.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837601}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T14:53:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":450676,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paula es una madre de familia de 23 a\u00f1os de edad que reside junto a su esposo y a sus dos hijos de 5 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad en una de las comunidades rurales que conforman el distrito agr\u00edcola de M\u00f3rrope, su comunidad es una zona bastante peque\u00f1a y humide de ambiente emprendedor en cuanto a sus actividades laborales y cooperacion con sus vecinos. \n\nSe dedica a la crianza y venta de animales, en la parte posterior de su vivienda tiene corrales en los cuales cria animales menores como pavos, patos, pollos, etc. Y frente de su domicilio en un predio de propiedad de sus padres cria y comercia ganado porcino, caprino y ovino.

He learned this trade from his father, who was the one who taught him from the time he was very young. As time passed, he met the woman who is now his wife. He married and they went to live in Basti\u00f3n with her family. Their house at the beginning was of thatch, but with effort, little by little, he constructed it of cement. In his shop he offers all types of services, but what his customers ask for most is body work, a service that he offers with the help of a neighbor whose work complements his. He also sells spare parts in general. Oscar's greatest problem is crime. Since his shop is small. when he has a lot of work he has to leave the cars outside, which thieves take advantage of to steal parts. The loan that he is applying for is to purchase a hydraulic crane, which he needs to lower the motors of the cars. He hopes to improve his services considerably with this machine and thus begin constructing the second floor of his house, so that the lower part can be used entirely for his

Trabaja en un taller de carpinter\u00eda de un amigo, al que acude todos los d\u00edas, desde muy temprano, para empezar con su faena. Mientras que el trabajo de construcci\u00f3n de viviendas lo realiza solo de manera eventual, cuando sus familiares, vecinos o cualquier cliente ocasional solicite su mano de obra; para ello trabaja con dos personas cuando necesita ayuda.

He is a good, friendly, and very hardworking person. He is not married, but he has two daughters who are 15 and 14 years old. He lives together with them in his sister\u2019s house, where his nieces and nephews also live. \r\n\r\nHis work is making furniture for the home and building houses. He works in the carpentry shop of a friend, where he goes to work every day. He begins his workday very early in the morning. He builds houses on his own, from time to time, when a family member, neighbors, or any occasional client requests services. He works with two additional people when he needs help. He has been doing this work (carpentry) for 20 years and the economic stability that this job has provided has allowed his family to have basic utilities in their house. He likes to express his creativity in the furniture and accessories he makes with the utmost care. He always has in mind that fact that quality is the highest demand of his customers. However, this work requires most of his time during the day, which prevents him from enjoying time with his family as much as he would like. Despite this difficulty, he has never regretted it, and now what he wants is to have his own carpentry workshop. He has been putting off this dream for a long time and now he is hoping to make it into reality.\r\n\r\nThis is his 5th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and he is very happy to know that he has financial support because this makes him feel more confident in making progress with his work. He pledges, once again, to make his repayments, as he did with the previous loans he\u2019s had. He also feels glad to belong to a communal bank because all of the members are very responsible and mutually supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, PEN 1,000.00 (nuevos soles) he will buy some tools that he needs to start this carpentry workshop, such as planes, hand saws, and hammers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1143615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy some tools to start his own carpentry workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T06:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T06:00:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justiniano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":151.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":174.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":184.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":151.24,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":159.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402112},{"amount":63.83,"local_amount":159.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456427},{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":158.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":167.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452088},{"amount":68.58,"local_amount":171.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447261},{"amount":69.78,"local_amount":174.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":183.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053162},{"amount":73.71,"local_amount":184.27,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":194.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188096}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T00:34:07Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":452756,"name":"Abavandimwe Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aziza  fait partie du groupe  Abavandimwe  et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

She's a seamstress and, fifteen years ago, she opened the workshop she's now running.\r\n\r\nThanks to her know-how and experience, she won over her clientele over time. Sewing is a business that's at times very busy (during the holidays) and, at others, very calm (very few customers).\r\n\r\nTo avoid this period of time, which often puts her in difficulty, Emilienne would like to use this loan to buy \"pagnes\" fabrics (colorful African cloth) that will enable her to make various clothes for different ages and tastes. She will display them in the window of her workshop, in order to attract customers and increase her sales.\r\n\r\nShe will put away the sales profits, in part to provide for her children's needs, and reinvest the remainder in her

Weekends are the busiest times, and many customers can't get service after early morning. \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas, with his nose for  business and taking advantage of the potential to serve the customers who came every day, added a new business offering telephone and internet service that has flourished, increased his earnings, and with which he hopes to achieve his dream to prosper and to keep growing his business. He is applying for his first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domino, with which he will buy a new washing machine to gradually meet the market demand for this service.

She lives in Samtredia District with her husband Pilate and their 20-year-old daughter, who is a student. Pilate works as a laborer in the village. Nunu requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly salary of Pilate and social assistance in the amount of 60 Laris per month. The monthly income of the family is 240 Laris. It is hardly enough to feed a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category; they get the above-mentioned monthly social assistance from the government, as they are estimated to live below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nNunu requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Nunu will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in an old empty farm building located in their yard. Nunu will work hard in the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family. Their income will double and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1147457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a milk cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Samtredia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nunu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":53.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.19,"local_amount":37.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449634},{"amount":27.25,"local_amount":43.6,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":45.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209842},{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":45.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":47.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440612},{"amount":28.96,"local_amount":46.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":47.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045663},{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":48.19,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":49.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181655},{"amount":30.78,"local_amount":49.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565531},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":50.76,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115110},{"amount":33.22,"local_amount":53.15,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":54.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860606},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":53.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":55.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569431},{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":55.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":57.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968086},{"amount":35.83,"local_amount":57.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":59.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748539},{"amount":36.91,"local_amount":59.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612477}],"funded_date":"2012-07-23T22:05:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}}]}
