Along with the agricultural business, Valerian works repairing cars and gets service fees for the work.\r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan to build a house. They live in a rented house.

She lives in Adigeni District, South Georgia, with her husband, Alexander. They have a 33-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter. Tamila's daughter is a student, and her son helps the family in its agricultural business. Tamila requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her trading business startup but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small-scale family agricultural business. They grow potatoes on a family-owned plot of land and also have a small-scale rabbit-breeding farm. They sell rabbits in the village. The monthly income of the family is 500 Laris. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nTamila requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tamila will purchase a small truck. She will start trading in seasonal fruits and vegetables. Alexander will help her. They will purchase fruits and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price markup. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions.

She is the mother of four children, one of whom is still living with her and helping the family's business. On two hectares of farmland, she grows paddy rice as her main source of income. Additionally, she plants cassava on another hectare of land to earn extra income. These are the businesses that she has been in for 30 years, and she is able to earn about 24,000 KHR per day. This is the fourth loan cycle for Nang and the second cycle for her other group member; her group consists of two. She has repaid the first loan successfully, and it has helped her to improve her current business gradually.

In her free time, Placida likes to watch the news and educational programs on TV.  On a few occasions, she prepares the delicious \u201clocro\u201d (Peruvian squash stew) to share with her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThrough her own initiative, Placida works with great effort and dedication each day at her small business of selling cheese.  She also earns some income by selling beer.  Placida works at her business approximately 10 hours each day.  She enjoys her job and believes she is doing well since her customers recommend her because of her good prices and friendly service.    \r\n<p>\r\nPlacida is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the assistance they will provide, she will be able to make improvements to her home.  She wants to add finishing touches such as plaster, paint, floor tiles, and windows to her home.  This will provide her family with greater security and well-being.  These improvements will also result in a more comfortable and pleasant environment in which her children can develop.  In the not-so-distant future, Placida wants to completely finish the construction of her home so that she can start a small grocery business in order to secure an education and a future for her children.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1139803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for home improvements.

With her current business, she can earn about KHR 60,800 per day. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for her is low crop yields resulting from flood. Sok is leading this group of two members who have been with VisionFund for three cycles. She has successfully managed to pay back the past loans that have helped her gradually improve her family\u2019s livelihood. She and the other member are applying for KHR 1,000,000 each. Sok will use her portion to buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland. She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her income so as to improve her standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1147491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-23T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-22T20:40:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chreb","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2042500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197023}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T06:43:51Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:30:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":452598,"name":"Lyzle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lyzle is a 26-year-old married woman and a mother of three young children ages 5, 3, and two years old.

She has been separated for four years from the father of her only daughter Jyody, who is twelve years old and in school.  It is for her that Marisol works hard, since she wants to provide her with a good education and a better future.  Currently they live in her parents' house.\r\n\r\nShe makes her living selling beauty products.  She does this from home or on the streets, working alongside her friends and acquaintances.  When she started, six years ago, it was difficult for her to be successful, since she didn't know very much about how to attract customers.

Vive en casa de sus padres donde todos los d\u00edas comparte con ellos la alegr\u00eda de estar juntos y trabajar para poder brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nSu trabajo es la venta de comida. Todos los d\u00edas sale a la vereda de su casa, por las tardes, para ofrecer deliciosos platillos t\u00edpicos de la regi\u00f3n, a los que acompa\u00f1a con refrescantes bebidas preparadas con frutas naturales. Brinda siempre un trato amable, una buena saz\u00f3n y alimentos hechos con ingredientes de la mejor calidad. Lleva realizando este trabajo por 3 a\u00f1os y empez\u00f3 siendo ayudante de su madre quien ahora le dio el control total del negocio, es por eso que trabaja mucho, ya que adem\u00e1s de trabajar tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 estudiando y tiene que darse tiempo para dedicarse a sus labores acad\u00e9micas. Anteriormente vend\u00eda jugos y panes durante las ma\u00f1anas, pero tuvo que cambiar de actividad debido a la importancia que representa para ella forjarse una carrera. Le gusta mucho lo que hace, ya que aparte de tener un tiempo disponible para otras funciones, tambi\u00e9n le genera muy buenas ganancias. Antes de poder realizar este trabajo ten\u00eda problemas con el pago de sus mensualidades en el instituto en donde estudia, pero ahora est\u00e1 m\u00e1s tranquila, ya que tiene un respaldo econ\u00f3mico.

She is single and doesn't have any children, since she would like to get an education before taking the plunge into motherhood. She lives in her parents' home, and shares with them the joy of being together and working to offer them a beter quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe works selling food. Every afternoon she goes out to the sidewalk in front of her home, and offers delicious regional dishes, which she serves with refreshing drinks made with natural fruit. She always treats her customers well, and offers them well-seasoned food, made with the highest quality ingredients. She has been in this business for three years. She started out as a helper for her mother, who has since put her fully in charge of the business. She works hard because, besides working, she also goes to school and has to allow herself time for schoolwork. She used to sell juices and bread in the mornings, but she had to make changes to the business because it is important to her to pursue a career. She enjoys her work very much, because besides having time available for other things, it also generates a very good profit. Before being able to work in this business, she had trouble making her monthly payments at the school she attends, but now she has more peace of mind, because she has financial backing. She would very much like to be able to expand her business, set up more tables and chairs, and stock up on some utensils she does not yet have. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP and she is very happy knowing they offer her financial support, because this gives her confidence in moving forward with her business. On her part, she is committed, once again, to making her payments in a timely fashion, as she did with previous loans. And she is very happy to belong to her communal bank, because all of its members are very kind and supportive. \r\n\r\nThe entire amount requested, 800 nuevos soles, will be invested in purchasing ingredients and supplies for her food, such as rice, chicken, oil, olives, and fruit, as well as two tables, eight chairs, a dozen plates, and other utensils she needs in order to offer a better service.

However, like any resourceful person, she combines this work with a second business, which is a laundry service. She works washing clothing by hand, mainly for police officers, and this is a job that can be done from the comfort of her home. She suffers from a condition in her legs which forces her to walk on crutches, which is why sometimes she needs help, though she generally works by herself. She very much enjoys her work because she feels that it is her way of showing other people that in spite of some difficulties you can always get ahead.

With the received credit, Marine will purchase fruit and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices and take them for sale to Tbilisi open market.

Ira requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up but without success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family runs a small-scale agricultural business. They grow maize and nuts on a family-owned plot of the land and sell the harvest at Kutaisi Market. Total average monthly income of the family accounts to 300 Laris, including monthly social assistance paid by the government which considers the family to be living in poverty. Their income is hardly enough to feed the four-member family. \r\n\r\nIra requested a loan from Credo to start up a trade business. Her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions extended to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the loan, Ira will purchase clothing at wholesale markets and sell it in Kutaisi with a price mark-up. She will take clothing to the local houses. In time, she will gain loyal customers and increase sales. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family. Ira will work hard and she will be able to improve the living conditions of herself and her family members.

Dato is a widower who lives in the village with his 19-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter. He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up but without success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nDato\u2019s daughter goes to school. Dato and his son work as agricultural workers in the village. They earn on average 150 Laris per month and it is the total average monthly income of the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable group category. \r\n\r\nDato requested credit for a start-up of agricultural business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit, Dato will purchase up to 30 calves. He will raise them over 5 to 6 months. He will take good care of the calves, as he has previous experience working with livestock.

He would like to stock up on materials and purchase two kilograms of fine silver.\r\n\r\nAlfredo has been selling through NOVICA since 2005. This is his story:\r\n\r\nAlfredo comes from Catacaos in northern Peru. \"Catacaos is considered the City of Filigree. I began to learn this art when I was 11 years old, with friends who taught me little by little. I enjoy it because a jeweler's work is a delicate art. I was awarded a scholarship to study with a professor from Israel and was even offered the chance to teach filigree there. But I love Peru too much to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to thank you for this microcredit. With it, I'll be able to buy more quality silver and offer new designs to my customers. It will also permit me to give the artisans who collaborate with me the security of steady work. I send you a heartfelt hug and my most cordial gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Alfredo's silver filigree jewelry on the NOVICA

He has been in this business for nearly seven years and enjoys it, since he shares in his father's family business.  This way he feels he supports the family and also generates his own income.  He says what he dislikes is when crops suffer from disease, as this can generate losses and decrease production.  But he combats it in time, even though it is expensive.  He plans to open a restaurant in the city, since cooking is one of his main passions.  But for now he will continue saving toward that goal.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan through MFP and he is happy and grateful for the final support he is receiving to continue.

He would like to invest in the bulk purchase of yarn in a variety of colors to expand his product lines.\r\n\r\nNestor has been selling through NOVICA since 2002. This is his story:\r\n\r\nNestor hails from Peru's Puno region, renowned for quality alpaca and sheep wool. He has been dedicated to the textile arts, a family trade for generations, for more than 25 years. When he first began to weave, he worked on the rustic looms he built along with other family members. Together they sold their creations at local markets until they were able to upgrade to more modern machinery, which in turn allowed them to develop new designs and expand their workshop.\r\n\r\n\"I started with a flat type of knit and little by little I ventured into creating collections with raised motifs that, for a long time, had been designs I had only sketched out on paper. Every year I learn more about new color trends, too, and so I have gradually been increasing the variety of designs I have to offer my customers. I wish to take this great opportunity of interest-free microcredit and use it toward the creation of my new collection. I feel like I finally have the time to dedicate to designing and knitting, rather than constantly searching for new ways of selling.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Nestor's alpaca apparel and accessories on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/artistdetail\/index.cfm?faid=3463"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1147843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to make a bulk purchase of yarn in a variety of colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323082683},{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332034585},{"amount":285.83,"local_amount":285.83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-07T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":285.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340259499},{"amount":262.18,"local_amount":262.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":262.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154308},{"amount":1645.99,"local_amount":1645.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381796033}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T18:43:34Z","paid_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":9,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Biggs","image":1109521}},{"id":452687,"name":"Nino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nino, 33, lives in Tskaltubo District, West Georgia with her four year old daughter and her mother-in-law.

Her salary is the main source of income for the family, along with the income of Nino\u2019s mother-in-law from small scale agricultural activities. The average monthly income of the family is 300 Laris. Also periodically Nino\u2019s husband sends some funds to the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to create a music studio, where she will teach music, in particular Georgian songs to local children. Also, the family plans to construct a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup capital with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Nino will purchase materials to renovate a room for her studio, as well as to purchase the relevant furniture for it. She will also purchase materials for the greenhouse construction. Nino\u2019s mother-in-law will grow greens and tomatoes in the greenhouse and sell the harvest at the local market. Nino will be busy in her music studio. The new business initiatives of the family, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly increase their income and even double it. With this, Nino will be able to provide better living conditions to her

Her partner is Aliardo, father of her two children, 9 and 3.\r\nShe sells beauty products which she buys from a catalogue and her main customers are her relatives and friends. She has achieved good results and has met many people that later become her customers. She has been doing this for almost 12 years, working always on her own. She also started selling clothes for children three years ago, although seasonally and only for special occasions and festivities. What she likes about her business is that she can manage her spare time and invest it in her young children, who she loves dearly and who are her inspiration to move forward. She also likes to have an income to support her partner with household expenses. \r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She is thankful for the opportunity of having a credit line to help her expand her business. She also feels comfortable with her Community Bank because the members are responsible and kind people. \r\nWith the requested amount of 1200 nuevos soles, Rosa will buy more clothes for children in various styles and will expand her stock of cosmetics and perfumes in order to offer more articles to her customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1145566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beauty supplies to increase her stock and children's clothes to continue her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":179.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":198.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":206.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":210.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":222.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.54,"local_amount":362.62,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":375.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456441},{"amount":78.42,"local_amount":198.13,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":205.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452102},{"amount":81.72,"local_amount":206.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":213.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447275},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":210.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":217.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053176},{"amount":88.01,"local_amount":222.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":230.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188110}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T00:37:52Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolina Zuniga","image":578398}},{"id":453538,"name":"Abdoulaye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Abdoulaye est un homme mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de deux enfants dont l'un fr\u00e9quente l'\u00e9cole primaire.Il tient dans son quartier ( district) un  magasin de vente de denr\u00e9es alimentaires et d'articles m\u00e9nagers divers.Ce commerce qui g\u00e9n\u00e8re des revenus assez consistants lui permet de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de sa famille.Afin de renforcer son fonds de commerce, il sollicite un pret de 500 000f pour acheter des sacs de riz, de l'huile, du sucre et d'autres denr\u00e9e alimentaires.Son ambition est d'ouvrir une seconde boutique.","en":"Abdoulaye is a married man and the father of two children, one of whom goes to primary school.

She takes care of additional family members (mother and father). She has had a business selling used clothes for seven years. She has applied for a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bales of used clothes. \r\n\r\nBesides this clothing business she generates additional income through selling eggs.

She manages the household, cares for her children, and sells bread, yuca, and other food products. She has been selling these products since she was young and unmarried. She learned her trade from her mother, who was also a vendor, and now Jenny has a lot of experience. She buys all the supplies she needs in the nearest town, which is 12 kilometers from her house, though sometimes she can buy locally. Mostly, she goes to town when she has the resources to do so.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy eight sacks of fertilizer, two gallons of insecticide, and improved seed for planting and to pay labor to grow 14,000 square meters of corn. Last year was not good because poor weather prevented her from harvesting; therefore, she wants to grow the most she can so that she can feed her family. The loan provides an opportunity to harvest and buy all her supplies at one time so that she doesn't run out of the money she needs for planting. A portion of the harvest will feed her family; the other part will be sold for income.\r\n\r\nJenny hopes to raise her children and provide for their needs while remaining in good standing with the institution, which she counts on for a helping hand in time of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1145634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy eight sacks of fertilizer, two gallons of insecticide, and improved seed for planting and to pay labor to grow 14,000 square meters of corn.

43-year-old Isatu from Kandeh town, southern area in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is married with six children between the ages of 7 years and 25 years. Five of her children are currently attending school. In 2002, Isata established her local foodstuffs business. She began her business because she was an agriculturist and her husband is a security guard but their income is not enough to support their family. She started selling palm oil, cassava couscous and rice to earn more income. She works at her business every day except holidays. She wakes up 5:00 in the morning in search of palm oil in the nearby villages. She says that the main challenges to her business are competition in the market and poor road networks in the villages.\r\n\r\nIsata requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, rice, and cassava couscous. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve their family welfare. In the future, Isata plans to open a palm oil store. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1147977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 39-year-old Theresa from Kandeh town, Southern area in Bo. She is married with three children between the ages of 4 years and 18 years old. Theresa's children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nTheresa runs a clothing and palm oil business; she sells clothes and palm oil. She has been running this business for five years. She works at the business seven days per week and 11 hours a day. She is also working as a gardener to receive another source of income. She describes her major problem as insufficient capital to operate the business.\r\n\r\nTheresa has requested a loan in order to purchase more palm oil and clothing material. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve the standard of living for her family and educate her children. In the future, she plans to open a big shop. She thanks you for your

The area is famous for its handmade fabrics, majolica ceramics and wood products. \r\n\r\nThirty-four years old, Catarina lives in a single-room structure with her husband, a tailor, and her two girls (11 and 8 years old) who are currently in primary school. She says that her biggest challenge is raising her girls, as she travels often for her business. Catarina enjoys cooking and spending time with her family whenever she can. Catarina is known as an outstanding member of her Trust Bank because of her positive attitude and good sense of humor, and also because she works hard every single day in order to give the best to her family. Catarina is so excited to get a new loan with Friendship Bridge after successfully repaying her previous loan, which helped to grow her business. Catarina's business is selling traditional clothing, which includes different types of huipils (typical blouses), typical skirts, belts, and aprons. As she wants to increase sales, Catarina is excited to use this loan to diversify her inventory of typical clothing so that she is able to respond to her customers\u2019 demands. She wants to provide the newest fashions to her customers, so she is happy to buy products from four weavers from different regions. By supporting the businesses of these other women, they too can sustain their families. She says, \"I seek for the common good, because we have needs from each other.\" Catarina currently sells in three different places, some as far as an hour away from home. She must get up at 4 am daily to prepare her products and transport them in minivans, buses and pick-ups. \r\n\r\nCatarina appreciates the education lessons Friendship Bridge provides at the monthly loan repayment meetings and finds them beneficial in achieving both her business and personal goals. Catarina's biggest dream is that her business will become self-sustaining so that it will continue to provide income, which will support her girls' education. Over time Catarina has improved her business's administration, all thanks to the business management training provided by Friendship Bridge. In addition, her first child is completing elementary school this year. Catarina is proud that she has been able to support her because of what she has learned through Friendship Bridge\u2019s curriculum that teaches parents how to support their children through school. Catarina only studied through 5th grade. She says that she can't imagine what great things her girls will be able to do if they continue their education. She wants her daughters to follow their dreams, become great professionals and serve the community.\r\n\r\nLike Catarina, the 11 other members of the Amistad Trust Bank, most of whom are also mothers, do business in textiles, clothing sales and tailoring, among other trades. They are so happy to be able to obtain another loan to grow their businesses, and thus continue to support their families. The 12 women acknowledge their financial support from people around the world and are grateful that they have opened their hearts to them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1148020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To diversify her inventory of clothing.

She makes bedspreads, clothing, and kitchen, bath, and dining room accessories that she sells for cash or credit upon receiving the customer's order, which she fills in three days. \n\nDenis works from 2:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m., and most of her customers are women, homemakers and employees. She wants to sell to market professionals and needs to upgrade her finishing process. Therefore, she is seeking her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy an overlock sewing machine, a camera, and materials and supplies such as fabric and thread to develop and improve her work. With her Kiva loan, she plans to be successful and offer her merchandise to department stores and commercial venues. She dreams of seeing her merchandise displayed everywhere and eventually have her own store. She is determined that her children finish college, and she will achieve all this through her and her husband's efforts, as he agrees that education will bring success to their children.

","en":"Diana is 25 years old and a married woman with two children of the ages of 6 and 8 years old.  They motivate her and inspire her to work every day.  About four years ago, Diana began to sell informal women's shoes from a shop in her home, taking advantage of the fact that her husband is a maker of these goods, and little by little gaining profits, which allowed her to save up and buy a glass cabinet to show off her goods.\r\n\r\nHer sister is a technology student and taught her to use a computer and to access the internet, and there she found many opportunities to take the business knowledge that she has and use it to generate greater profits, increasing her income.  That is why she converted her living room into an internet cafe with two computers for the use of her nearby neighbors.  This small business had a large impact on her neighborhood, so she has added a transcription service, then more computers, a calling service, and video games.\r\n\r\nToday, she feels the need to increase the size of her business to meet her customers' growing demand and to obtain a better income.  Currently, her husband's business of footwear production is also a part of her daily activities, as she invests in prime quality materials and supplies and her husband creates the beautiful designs and fabricates the shoes that Diana sells to her customers.  She makes her purchases in specialty stores for cobbling and has three internet suppliers as well.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a micro-loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy patent leather, heels, soles, and other supplies so that her husband can creatively develop a variety of sandals to the specifications of her customers' requests.  With this investment, it will be an opportunity to fulfill her customers' needs quickly and to slowly increase her sales, which has the end result of greater well-being for her family.  A goal that she and her husband consistently work toward."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1145658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy patent leather, heels, soles, and other inputs to construct sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T17:40:10Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76213},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82269},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84188},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86153},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88163},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90220},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92325},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94479},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96684},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98940},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101248},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.3,"local_amount":76213,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76905.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395550},{"amount":46.75,"local_amount":82269,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83016.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775336},{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":84188,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84953.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387338},{"amount":48.55,"local_amount":85441,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86217.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994162},{"amount":50.49,"local_amount":88875,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89682.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130519},{"amount":51.27,"local_amount":90220,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91040.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519389},{"amount":52.45,"local_amount":92325,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":93164.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071233},{"amount":53.68,"local_amount":94479,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":95337.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497444},{"amount":54.94,"local_amount":96684,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":97562.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527268},{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":98940,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":99839.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928044},{"amount":119.53,"local_amount":210366,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":212278.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705231}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T03:50:48Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":452881,"name":"Paulita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulita is 58 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Tiene cuatro a\u00f1os de dedicarse a esta actividad y ella considera que la va muy bien. \n\nElla compra todos los materiales que necesita en los pueblos vecinos que se encuentra a 12 kil\u00f3metros de distancia de su casa, siendo su mayor dificultad que no puede comprar en grandes cantidades por falta de dinero; esto le demanda mayor cantidad de tiempo porque tiene que viajar con mayor frecuencia en busca de lo que necesita para elaborar su venta.  \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para comprar 4 mesas, una plancha para cocer las pupusas y materia prima. Con la finalidad de establecerse en un lugar fijo, pues ella va de casa en casa ofreciendo sus productos y por encargo, por esa raz\u00f3n ella quiere instalarse en su casa y que lleguen ah\u00ed sus clientes para operar de la mejor manera. Para que sus ingresos sean mayores, debido a que sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando y el mayor de ellos ya esta en la universidad y su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es ver a sus hijos con una carrera universitaria y que vivan de una manera diferente a la que ella se desarrollo, pues por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos no pudo lograr su sue\u00f1o de ser doctora y lo que m\u00e1s desea es hacer realidad ese sue\u00f1o en cada uno de sus hijos con lo que han elegido estudiar. \n\n","en":"Ms. Delmy, 42, is married and has three children who are 19, 15 and 12 respectively. She lives alone with her children who are in school, as her husband is working in the capital city and has forgotten about them. She devotes herself to carrying out domestic duties at home and making and selling traditional foods such as tamales, <A HREF=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pupusa\" TARGET=\"_new\">pupusas<\/A>, hot chocolate, fried yucca threads, and <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.postresdelacipota.com\/2011\/08\/nuegados-de-yuca.html\" TARGET=\"_new\">nuegados<\/A> among other items. She's been in this business for four years and believes it is going very well. She purchases all the materials she needs in surrounding villages which are 12 kilometers from her house. Her greatest difficulty is not being able to buy large quantities for lack of money. So she must spend more of her time because she must travel more frequently looking for what she needs to make her products. \r\n\r\nThe requested loan is for the purchase of four tables, a grill for cooking the pupusas, and raw materials, in hopes of establishing a fixed location because she now goes door to door selling her products and by order. Therefore she wants to set things up at home so her customers may come there and she may run the business better. She hopes to increase her income since her children are in school and the eldest is already at the university. Her biggest dream is to see her children with university degrees and that they would live a different life from the one she has, since for lack of economic resources she was not able to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. What she most wishes for is that this dream would become reality in each of her children, and so they have chosen to get some schooling. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1145689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase four tables, a grill for cooking the pupusas and raw materials.
