In this way Rosa will be able to have the necessary merchandise to begin her small clothing business and be able to receive income. She hopes to use this money to secure the education and well being of her small children. Her largest dream is to see them become great professionals and good men.

Her husband is Erlando, and she is mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nEden operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEden hopes that her business will grow and expand through all her hard work on it.

They inherited their house from Gloria's father. She makes and sells pottery, an activity that she learned from a young age from her mother. Today she works to take care of her household from 8am until 4pm. The process starts by pulling the dirt, preparing it, setting the mud, scraping it, drying it, sanding it down, and finally firing the finished product. \r\n\r\nShe asks for a loan to buy dirt, nacaschol [a product used to make black dye] and firewood, which are needed to make the pottery. This loan will be very helpful to her because she'll have the basic materials that she needs to continue producing the pots, griddles, frying pans and other cooking utensils that are made from the mud called Loza. \r\n\r\nHer dream is through her business to be able to propel her children in their studies, because she wasn't able to go to school and she wants to see them become professionals so that they can have a better future and opportunities.

Altanzul lives with his wife on his small plot of the land in the ger district (ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His wife works as a receptionist in a hotel. Both of their salaries are low and usually do not meet their family's necessities. So, Altanzul also runs a taxi business on nights and weekends to earn extra income. \r\nHe owns an old, small house on his land plot and lately it has been in very bad condition and cold to live in. It was built about 20 years ago and it has not had any major renovation or repairs. In winter it has a heat loss through the walls and windows. So he sent his children to his parents in the countryside. \r\nThis summer he is planning to repair his house by installing wall insulation and building a small, one-room addition. It is very beneficial for his family to live comfortably and to stay warm at home. Every winter it costs much money to buy the coal to keep his house warm. He knows that it is harmful to his family's health and living environment. Also, he has a plan to build a small garage beside his home for his taxi car.

She is married with Fernando, who is a mechanic, and they have three children aged 13, 9 and 3 whom they love very much. They all live in the house they have been able to buy thanks to their working efforts.\r\n\r\nShe sells women\u2019s girdles that she buys in the city of Lima where she has an aunt that sends her the products she orders; she then sells them to her working colleagues, as she is a teacher in a school of her town. She has been engaged in this activity for 3 years, and she sells on credit collecting it after 30 days at a max. She likes her activity because it allows her to earn another income on top of her salary, as in some occasions she did not have enough to pay for her expenses even though she shares them with her husband. In this way and also thanks to a loan she has previously received, she has succeeded in opening a small spare parts shop and she sometimes helps her husband who works there as a mechanic.

Daily she begins working very early in the morning, and dedicates 12 hours a day to her business.

He needs his vehicle to carry out this activity as well, in order to transport soda crates up to his customers\u2019\u2019 houses; as a consequence, some parts of his vehicle are not in optimal conditions and needs to be substituted. His earnings allow him to help his parents paying for their household expenses, on top of granting him financial freedom. He wants to become a successful entrepreneur, but considering the good results he is obtaining as a moto-taxi driver he now plants on owing a fleet of motorcycle taxis.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan he is requesting to MFP and he feels deeply grateful for the economic support he is receiving as this will help him progress with his activity. He also says he likes his Communal Bank because he thinks its members are kind and caring people.\r\n\r\nA portion of the 1500 PEN he has requested will be invested in the purchase of accessories and spare parts he needs to repair his motorcycle.

She is married and has three children.  Her older sons are in the Russian Federation, and daughter is married.  Manzura is a happy grandmother of three grandsons.  Manzura has been partnering with our organization since 2003.  She sells men's clothing at a market.  Previously, she worked as a teacher at a local school, but because her salary was very low, she decided to get involved in business.  This business yields a very good profit.  Also, Manzura helped her daughter to open a retail outlet to sell fabrics for sewing women's clothing.  She wants to use this loan to bring in man's seasonal clothing and expand her business.  Manzura is grateful for the financial support and hopes to continue the partnership with

It is made up of 17 entrepreneurs who makes their livings in different lines of work including clothing sales, wood sales, firewood sales, jewelry, perfumes, loaf bread and services, among others.  They all live in the city of Talca.\r\nClaudia, the representative of the communal bank, is in the first row of the photo.  She is the third from the left, wearing a white jacket with pink trim and has light brown hair worn in a ponytail. \r\nClaudia makes her living baking, making cushions and making bathroom curtains.  She says that she works with others making the cushions, which she does from Monday to Sunday.  And in the afternoons, she sells her baked goods, specifically cakes, and \"calzones roto\" (a Chilean sweet made of fried dough.  It uses flour, baking powder, powdered sugar and eggs and is usually served in the wintertime).  Claudia's work schedule is divided according to her availability.  She purchases her merchandise from supermarkets and wholesalers that offer everything she needs for her baked goods, cushions and curtains at low cost, which makes it economically advisable. \r\nWith this loan, Claudia will make purchases for her baked goods, specifically flour, eggs, oil, sugar and margarine.\r\nClaudia's goal is to get even better at making the cushions and curtains, as she hasn't been doing it for as long.\r\nClaudia lives with her 9-year old daughter.  Her dream for her personal life is to finish school, as she was only able to attend through her eighth year of primary school.\r\nClaudia is very happy about and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has offered her to invest in her business.  In addition, she feels very comfortable with the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank; they share with each other their different businesses and interests.\r\nTalca belongs the Maule Region, which is located in Chile's central zone.  It constitutes the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region.  It is the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a funny saying in Chile about Talca, the phrase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres.\"  (Talca, Paris and London).  Among the rumors, it is said that the phrase is a derivation of one originally said by an Englishman \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca seems like London) because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in wintertime, just like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1146858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00eda especialmente cosm\u00e9ticos, que es la l\u00ednea que mas rota en su negocio. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y muchas veces de contado y recupera su dinero semanal, quincenal, mensual, de acuerdo con lo pactado con su cliente. Compra en almacenes especializados de telas e insumos de confecciones y proveedores de cosm\u00e9ticos; con ellos adquiere    precios competitivos, por ser una buena cliente y por sus compras de contado. En la medida en que su negocio crece su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para responder con oportunidad a su clientela, porque trabaja a todo costo y tienen muchos encargos de cosm\u00e9ticos. Su meta es extenderse en el mercado y aumentar su capital de trabajo,  por eso ha recurrido a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 cosm\u00e9ticos, telas e insumos para elaborar ropa infantil y cosm\u00e9ticos para responder a nuevos clientes. Hilda dia a dia se esmera en su trabajo, con el fin de hacer crecer su negocio y lograr su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o que es el de tener su casa propia.","en":"Hilda, age 30, lives in the city of Cartagena with her husband and three children, who are between three and eight years old.  She got her business experience eight years ago by selling various merchandise by order to friends and referred customers.\r\n\r\nWith her business activity she managed to get savings, and she took a sewing course.  She later entered the world of fashion by organizing her workshop in the place where she lives.  She offers individual sewing services according to the style, fashion, and size that her customers select.  Among her main customers are her colleagues at the church she attends, neighbors, and referrals.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells merchandise, especially cosmetics, which is the line that turns over the most in her business.  She makes her sales on credit, and many times for cash.  She collects her money weekly, biweekly, or monthly, according to the agreement with her customer.\r\n\r\nShe buys at warehouses specializing in fabrics and sewing supplies and from make-up providers from whom she gets competitive prices for being a good customer and for her cash purchases.  To the extent that her business is growing she does not have enough working capital to respond to her customers in a timely fashion because she works very hard and has a lot of cosmetic orders.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to extend herself in the market and to increase her working capital.  To do this she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy cosmetics, fabric, and supplies to make children\u2019s clothes.

He is married to Rosalina, 27, and has been blessed with three children: Elviana, 5 years old; Aldorius, 3 and a half years old; and George, 2 and a half years old. After he graduated from Junior high school, Eduard worked at a furniture business, from which he learned the skill to create various types of furniture, i.e.. beds, cabinets, door frames, window sills, tables, chairs, etc. In 2011, Eduard decided to quit his previous employer and start his own business. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, he is able to employ one assistant to help him in completing the work. Eduard is really grateful for having many orders from his customers. Recently, he got orders to produce 32 door frames and 32 window sills but he doesn\u2019t have enough wood in stock to complete the order. Therefore, he requested a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,500,000 to buy wood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1149996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

She inherited this from her mother, who is also a merchant in the neighboring country of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge now is to have cash in order to buy in bulk and to get more discounts.  That is why she has turned to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy blouses, pants, shoes, and supplies.  With her Kiva loan she will increase her working capital and her volume of sales.  That will make this a successful investment that will keep her active in the market.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1140970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy blouses, pants, shoes, and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-25T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-24T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109759},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112320},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114941},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117623},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120367},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":123176},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":126050},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128991},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132001},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135081},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138233},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141458}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.2,"local_amount":109759,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":110461.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395548},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":112320,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":113038.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775334},{"amount":65.14,"local_amount":114941,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":115676.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387336},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":117623,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":118375.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994160},{"amount":68.21,"local_amount":120367,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":121137.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519387},{"amount":141.23,"local_amount":249226,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":250821.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071232},{"amount":73.09,"local_amount":128991,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129816.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497443},{"amount":151.35,"local_amount":267082,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":268791.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928043},{"amount":78.33,"local_amount":138233,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":139117.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705230},{"amount":80.16,"local_amount":141458,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":142363.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967542}],"funded_date":"2012-08-23T02:25:02Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":453345,"name":"Rudolof","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rudolof is a 51-year-old, married man.

Province. She has four children, one of whom still depends on her and is still in school. To strive for her family, Yim grows cassava on three hectares of farmland to generate income. She also earns extra minimal income as a doctor in the village. Having been with this business for 12 years, she currently can earn about 30,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is the microloan for Yim's group of two; Yim is a second-cycle client and the other member is a first-cycle client.

She grows cassava and paddy rice on two hectares of farmland each. She has been farming for the past 12 years; currently, she is able to earn about 16,000 KHR per day from her farms. \r\n\r\nPhally took her first loan with KIVA's partner VisionFund in 2011. The loan, which she completely paid back, has helped her to better support her big family. Now she leads a micro-loan group of two in requesting a new loan. Her requested amount is 1,400,000 KHR, and the other member is applying for 1,200,000 KHR. Phally is going to use her loan portion to buy seeds and fertilizers for her rice farm.

With the loan she will buy men's and women's clothing for the winter season.\r\n\r\nOne of Erna's goals for her business is to be able to rent a shop, since in this way she could work more comfortably, avoiding the cold during the winter and the heat during the summer. Erna lives with her mother, her husband, and their two children, ages 18 and 24. Her dream for her work is to have the possibility of renting a shop to generate greater income, and her dream for her family is to see her children finish their education and graduate, and thus see her work completed.\r\n\r\nErna is very happy and grateful for the loan and the services offered by Fondo Esperanze. In addition, she comments that she feels very comfortable  in the meetings and in her communal bank group, since there is generosity and unity.\r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 18 km in a straight line to the south from the Plaza de Armas in Santiago (the capital of Chile). It is known as the capital of folklore, because every year in January, they hold the International Festival of Folklore, an event in which the ethnic groups of the country gather and meet with musical groups from all of South America. The Traditional Art Fair has also developed, in which Chilean artists as well as those from other countries participate. Then in April they hold \"Abril Cuecas Mil,\" in which the entire community dances the cueca, a traditional Chilean dance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5325,"image":{"id":1147956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

On her land she plants peas, beans, corn and potatoes which she sells in the wholesale market (20 minutes away). For this, she counts on the support of her eldest children and her husband.

He\u2019s married, and he lives in Lebanon with his wife Kawakeb, the mother of their two school-aged children. Ali is doing the best he can to support his family and offer them a suitable life. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Ali opened his own garage. He started work painting cars, attracting customers from all over the surrounding areas. \r\n\r\nEven though he earns an okay income, Ali suffers from a bad financial situation.
