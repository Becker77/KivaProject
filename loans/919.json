Janet is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kacwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past four years, Janet has been working hard to manage her tailor shop, where she tailors and sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to expand her business by adding more clothes, and will help Janet to generate greater profits and pay for school fees. Janet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build on it. \r\n\r\nJanet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Janet's future prospects by helping her to save money and

For the past three years, Beatrice has been working hard to manage her bakery, where she sells baked goods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Beatrice has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy ingredients for her business, and will help Beatrice to generate greater profits and pay school fees and buy other things for her household. Beatrice hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Beatrice's future prospects by helping her to develop her business.

She has 3 children, aged 22, 20 and 18, for whom she provides both moral and economic support. For more than 10 years, she has worked in agriculture and ranching. For this reason she is requesting the loan to buy a milk cow, because with this she will be able to increase her income a little more and give her children a better life. Her husband's work is public transportation, but since his vehicle runs on gasoline, he doesn't have much net profit for his family. Since she was very young, the borrower worked in farming together with her parents, whom she continues to help with the planting and harvest of their crops. She is from a humble background and values what she has, since thanks to the effort and determination of herself and her husband, they have been able to get ahead and were able to build the little house where they currently live.

Gisele has been running a small \"call box\" business in a district of the capital for 5 years, and also owns a small stall from which she sells soap, stock cubes, sugar, salt and many other items. She buys calling credit from the telecom operators twice a week, on average.

This loan will certainly permit Sophie Egnonk\u00e8 and the other members of her group to expand their businesses by adding to their stock of merchandise and growing their clientele and their income. Their first two loans have been correctly reimbursed.

Her husband works as a miner at a coal mine.  Victoria sells children's clothing for boys.  Her kiosk is located at market.  She previously leased it, but then reached an agreement with its owner to finance its purchase.  She was able to pay off the cost of the kiosk within several years and can now save by not paying lease.  Victoria has been involved in sales for over five years, has many clients, and her business is going well.  She is requesting this loan to expand her business.  She wants to expand her kiosk in order to set out more clothing there.

His partner's name is Lizbeth, and they have a son together. They all live in the house he owns in the small village of Villa Ashaninka, in the central jungle.\r\n\r\nHe has been a farmer for seven years. He grows coffee, plaintains, and oranges on three plots of land given him by the community. He is very responsible. This month he had to cover an order of coffee beans made by a distribution center, and had to stay on his land day and night in order to get the job done. Now the coffee bean harvest is over and he is dedicated to taking great care of his fruit, since he can sell it any time of the year.

children.  She works as a cook.  She lives together with her husband in their own home.  Olga is requesting a loan in the amount of 6000 hryvnia to replace windows at home.

businessman from a small village, called Uglya, in the Western part of Ukraine.  He has been working in his region for 12 years, being involved in various types of business, such as providing transportation services, reselling wood and selling animal feed.  He considers competition to be one of the primary difficulties in his work and this is why he does not stop on any single type of entrepreneurial focus.

In the photo, she is seated in the third row, second from the right, wearing a blue skirt with pink trim. She is wearing a medal and she has dark chestnut hair that she is wearing loose.\r\nShe has been engaged in grocery store sales for two years.  She says that she works in her home Monday through Sunday, from 7:30 to 10:30.  \r\nShe purchases the merchandise and supplies she needs for her grocery store from various supermarkets and candy distributors at low cost, so her business is profitable.\r\nShe will use the loan to purchase chocolates, candy, noodles, butter, and flour.\r\nOne of Sandra\u2019s business goals is to have the opportunity to expand her store so that she can serve more customers, generate higher income, and in this way, achieve a better quality of life.\r\nSandra lives with her husband and three children, ages 22, 10, and 8.

This is her main livelihood to support her family. She is asking for a loan to buy new fishing nets, wood and nylon.

She is a tailor and works in the leather clothes factory in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. She has been doing her job for seven years and her salary does not meet her family's expenses. Her husband, Erdenebat, 32, is a builder and does not earn enough money. \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to cover the cost of new sheep wool felt covering for her old ger. In winter her ger becomes cold because it does not have a good covering. Her two children always have flu due to the cold at home. Her choosen ger cover is made from traditional sheep wool and is insulated with breathable material which holds the warmth for a long time.

She lives together with her husband and her three children in her home, which is located in one of the villages that makes up the agricultural district of Tambogrande. Her community only has basic electricity service.\r\n\r\nShe works in agriculture-related activities. She works in ranching, raising sheep and poultry and selling them once they have reached a good level of development. She also has a half hectare of farm land planted with lemons which she harvests weekly. All the products from her activities are sold to dealers and middlemen in the area. This work is the most common in this area and is the principal subsistence activity in the area.\r\n\r\nShe has more than five years of experience in this business and her husband helps her in his spare moments. Carmen is applying for a loan of 1000 Nuevos Soles that she is planning to use to buy balanced feed and natural pastures to fatten animals and also to buy fertilizer for her lemon crop. This investment will allow her to continue growing as a businesswoman and that way improve her quality of life. Carmen is grateful in advance for the help given.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1148762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy balanced feed y natural pastures to fatten animals and also to buy fertilizers for her lemon crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-07-27T10:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-26T10:10:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":72.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":86.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":92.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":97.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":99.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":66.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":70.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317409},{"amount":28.98,"local_amount":72.45,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":76.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374250},{"amount":29.14,"local_amount":72.85,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385477},{"amount":30.16,"local_amount":75.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-21T09:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":79.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315369082},{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":82.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322978111},{"amount":32.68,"local_amount":81.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":85.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115275},{"amount":33.54,"local_amount":83.85,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":88.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506959},{"amount":34.76,"local_amount":86.9,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":91.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058892},{"amount":152.48,"local_amount":381.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":400.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804418}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T02:30:01Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:47:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":452955,"name":"Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro es un hombre honrado con valores arraigados desde su infancia, ha procreado a 4 hijos maravillosos, trabaja como despachador de diesel en una gasolinera.
