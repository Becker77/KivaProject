He lives in a rented house with his four beloved children.  He is their only means of support since his wife died a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life Serapio has had many different jobs.  He is currently working as a bricklayer and his services are highly sought after by his neighbors.  When someone needs a roof installed or a wall erected they always call on him because of his experience.\r\n\r\nSerapio enjoys working in construction because he knows that with this honorable profession he is able to educate his children.  He has been in this profession for 10 years and considers the most difficult part having to carry the heavy bricks and to mix the cement sometimes even with his hands which has caused his hands to age quickly.  This is why he\u2019d like to upgrade his work tools in order to improve the work he does.\r\n\r\nThis is his 3rd loan with MFP and he doesn\u2019t want to miss repaying it for lack of money so he is already making contacts for more construction jobs. \r\n\r\nHe is the only male in his communal bank so he always tries to be responsible and respectful towards the other members.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1000 new soles to buy new beams and supports so that he can work on more jobs at once thus improving his income.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The people who live there are hardworking, enterprising, and know how to confront challenges, adapt to change, and find new and innovative methods of production.  This area offers traditional cuisine and a wide variety of dishes.  At the Sunday fairs, people wear colorful outfits and sell a wide variety of products.  The canton of Paute is truly known as a garden because of its fruit and flower production.  A wide variety of high-quality roses are grown for export.  There are several locations that provide panoramic views of the canton and the surrounding areas.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sra. Rosa Elena.  She is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cProgresar al Futuro\u201d and lives in a community within the canton of Paute.  Rosa is 35 years old, married, and has five children (ages 18, 16, 14, 12, and 10).  Her oldest daughter is married and independent.  Two other children are in high school and the remaining two attend a smaller school in town.  Her husband works as a bricklayer.  Rosa\u2019s family does not own a home, so they live at her mother\u2019s house and share in the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosa Elena takes care of the household chores, but she also spends time raising guinea pigs to sell.  She also devotes some time to farming, but what she produces is only for consumption by her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with the Communal Bank after having been invited by a friend.  Her loan will be invested in construction materials so that she can finish her house.  \r\n<p>\r\nOn this occasion, four children are included in the photo since they are related to some of the members.  There is a baby in the arms of her mother, a little boy who is seated with a bandana on his head, another boy on the second row with a gray sweatshirt, and a young girl standing at the back wearing a coffee-colored sweater.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":892427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials for finishing the construction of her house.

every single day, one can find Catalina nestled behind a fragrant pile of herbs and flowers that she sells in the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. As one walks past Catalina and the other women lined up on either side of her on the busy city sidewalks, the relaxing scents of mint, thyme, and oregano waft into the air. Catalina brings these herbs and flowers fresh cut from the countryside every single morning and continues selling until the sun sets. Her clients consist of everyone from mothers preparing the daily meal to lovesick boyfriends buying flowers for their sweethearts. She even sells to traditional healers who use these herbs as medicines, as each one has a specific healing property, explains Catalina. For example, thyme is often used in teas to ease an upset stomach. <P>\r\n\r\nFlowers and herbs are not the only thing Catalina sells in the busy city. She and her husband own a small field just outside the city where they plant and raise several different types of potatoes which are then sold in Ayacucho and two times each year taken in large loads to the capital Lima where they are also sold in the markets. Additionally, Catalina buys large supplies of cereals such as corn and barley which she sometimes sells along with her flowers and herbs. <P>\r\n\r\nCatalina says it is only thanks to her village bank that she has been able to venture into so many markets. Thanks to the economic support she has received through loans, she was able to purchase her field and begin growing potatoes, as well as begin buying and selling cereals. With the money she has been saving in the bank, Catalina has many goals she wishes to accomplish. First and foremost, Catalina is intent on funding the education of all 9 of her children, three of whom are already studying in the local university. In addition to this, Catalina would also like to make improvements to her home. She is currently requesting a loan of US$ 500. The majority of this money will be spent on fertilizer for her potatoes, as they have just recently been planted and are beginning to grow. The rest of the money will be spent on the purchase of large supplies of cereals to be sold in the city."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":88320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for potatoes and cereals to sell in the city","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T02:42:12Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1490,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":372.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":372.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":372.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":373.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112782},{"amount":125,"local_amount":372.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":373.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132130},{"amount":125,"local_amount":372.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":373.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153929},{"amount":125,"local_amount":372.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":373.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178114}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T02:42:12Z","paid_date":"2008-04-09T09:13:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29354,"name":"Farida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farida U. lives in Khujand.

She enjoys an unparalleled reputation in her area, one of the most populated in the capital of Banimonoti\u00e9 Bougouni. In her search for complementary financial resources, she decided to try the loan program from microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After having obtained 3 group loans with a local association, she moved on to individual loans; she is on her 3rd loan. Each of her loans were repaid without difficulty. She would like this loan to buy 2 bags of wheat flour, 20 liters of cooking oil, and 2 loads of firewood. She gets her supplies from wholesalers at the big market in Bougouni and cooks in front of her door, located in the Heremakono district. The donuts she makes are sold at a set price in front of her home, and the clientele consists of every social class in the city. With the help of the loan, she plans to be able to earn 50,000 CFA francs per month, which will be used to pay interest on her loan, improve her business, and contribute to her family\u2019s

Many years ago they completed their third loan cycle. The association is located in the region of Los Andes in the city of El Alto.  To date, the group consists of 18 members and they have shown themselves to be a well-organized group especially when dealing with their loan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of the group are mostly married women with children, most of whom are school-aged.  There are a few children that were sadly forced to leave school because their family lacked financial resources, and they end up helping the parents run the small businesses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many types of businesses are being run by the members of the group, such as: food sales, dairy sales, and clothing sales. But the most common business is the sale of potatoes. Lucia, for example, much like her other colleagues, she has been selling for a great long while alongside her father in the markets of Ceja (the central region of the city of El Alto).

She is involved in selling flour at a food market in the Spitamen district.  She buys flour wholesale once per month and sells it retail at the market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is Margie J.'s group.\r\n\r\nMargie is 29 years old, married, and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, she owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Margie has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Margie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Margie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used for the same purpose. This will be Margie\u2019s second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Del Ej\u00e9rcito\" (\"Army Avenue\") communal bank. She works as a businessperson; for the past two years, she has operated telephone call booths, which are managed by her nephew. At the same time, she also runs a restaurant, which she has operated for the past 10 years in the bus station of the city of Portoviejo. Her two businesses are next to each other, and she starts work there very early in the morning. \r\n\r\nRina is a woman who loves to work, and she does not mind all the sacrifices she has to make to maintain her businesses. At 4 in the morning, she goes to the city's central market to buy everything she needs for her restaurant, and at 7, she is already serving breakfast to her customers. Once breakfast is over, she begins preparing the food for lunch, and at 5 in the evening she ends her workday. \r\n\r\nRina has been a member of her communal bank for two loan cycles, and she has been able to maintain her businesses with the loans. With this new loan, she will invest in buying products such as fruits, beans, meats, lunch meat, and other grocery items to prepare the various foods she offers her customers. She also wants to invest in a new business: a snack bar where she can sell fruit smoothies and toasted sandwiches in the same area where she has her other two businesses. \r\n\r\nRina reports that everything she does is for the well-being of her children; one daughter is studying at the university, and her other children are with their father in Quito. Her dream is to have a farm and enjoy life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":542258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying meat, rice, beans, potatoes and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rina Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":253.13,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":253.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892515},{"amount":253.12,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":253.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632861},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846895}],"funded_date":"2010-06-05T19:54:24Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":206383,"name":"Consolacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Consolacion J. is from the village of Parog-Parog, Solana, Cagayan.

It is made up of hard-working and enterprising people who are always looking for opportunities to get ahead and to give their children a better future through their daily efforts. The communal bank's meetings are held every 30 days at the central office of the Arariwa Association. \n\nThe economic activities of some of the members are, for example, selling food, selling hens and guinea pigs, selling handicrafts, selling hay, selling stuffed peppers, and selling tamales. Other members provide services such as child care and manual labor. \n\nNeil is 24 years old and has one child. She was born in Cusipata district, located 45 minutes from the city of Cusco, and she currently lives in the city of Cusco. Since she was 11 years old, Neil has been surrounded by the business of selling tamales. Her sister-in-law Nayda went into the business of preparing tamales, and Neil helped her sell the tamales in the buses that travel from the city of Sicuani to Cusco. She got into the buses and asked the drivers if she could offer her tamales to the passengers. Several years ago, she got married and had to come live in the city of Cusco to be with her husband.\n\nDetermined to start a new life, she moved to Cusco. She used her savings to prepare tamales and sell them at the bus station in Cusco, where she gets on the buses and offers them to the travelers. She can be found at the terminal 7 days a week, from 5 in the morning until 6 in the evening, or until the tamales run out. She sells tamales in two varieties, sweet and savory, at a price of 0.50 soles each.\n\nFor her next loan, Neil hopes to receive 1000 Peruvian soles. She would like to buy corn, corn husks, sugar, eggs, raisins and many more ingredients. At present, Neil is worried because the director of the bus terminal wants to evict her; he is requiring her to rent a sales stand, but she does not have enough money to rent one. Her dream is to open a small food store in her home, and she would like to become a microentrepreneur.                         \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":575678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying corn, corn husks, sugar, eggs, raisins and many more supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ocongate - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4050,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neil Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Etelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leslie Hindira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2684.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2791.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2903.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3019.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":953.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":991.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1031.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1072.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":954.71,"local_amount":2687.32,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2692.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166801209},{"amount":992.91,"local_amount":2794.85,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070982},{"amount":1032.61,"local_amount":2906.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2911.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362279},{"amount":1069.77,"local_amount":3011.23,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3016.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497187}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T00:59:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":222769,"name":"Luisa Amanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luisa R. es soltera tiene un hijo peque\u00f1o labora para LOTERIA NACIONAL como cajera su labor consiste en recibir efectivo producto de la venta de billetes de loter\u00eda.\nDe los dos pr\u00e9stamos obtenidos en CEPRODEL  he logrado mejorar algunos detalles como hacer el ba\u00f1o de mi casa y reparaciones en general.\nMe siento contenta ya que poco a poco he ido dando respuestas a las necesidades del hogar.\n\n\n","en":"Luisa R. is single and has one small child.

She is a resident of Caloocan City just north of Manila on the island of Luzon. By the grace of God, Ursula has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to support both of her children and continue sending them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Ursula, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n<p>\r\nUrsula operates a buy-and-sell business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sell items piecemeal, thus resulting in a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low prices and the many options they are offered. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\nUrsula dreams of giving her all of her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners.

She sells mostly corn in cans and sacks (120 meticais for 31 cans and 360 meticais for 50 sacks), earning an income of around 21,600 meticais for each period.  She uses this money for household expenses, and owing to her husband's illness (he is currently hospitalized), she does not have enough money because of the hospital expenses.  Joana approached Hluvuku and Kiva to request a loan to keep up with her work.\r\n\r\nThis is Joana's second loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.

Darling is 21 years old, single, and is in her second year of secondary school.  She makes a living selling foodstuffs, including sweets, juice, and fruit.  She started her business with the help of an aunt who makes a living selling fruit and sweets on Estel\u00ed\u2019s central street.  Every morning Darling likes to sell her products near the central street, since it is only 100 meters from a school where most of the students buy sweets from her.  In the afternoons she takes her cart of fruit and sweets and walks around in order to sell the rest of her merchandise and thus earn her daily bread.  Darling would like to have her own fruit and sweets shop in Estel\u00ed\u2019s municipal market.  \r\n\r\nDarling is asking for a loan so that she can purchase more fruit and stock up on sweets, since Holy Week is approaching and that is considered an especially good time of year for business.  The loan will be of great help to her, and she hopes it will allow her to increase her sales and clientele and improve her income so that she can pay for her studies.  Darling\u2019s plan for the future is to open a beauty salon, as she is studying cosmetology on the weekends and that is an activity she enjoys.  Her immediate goal, though, is to finish her studies in secondary school so that she can apply to a university course, since her dream is to be a professional who is both enterprising and useful to

Her husband paints houses for a living, and up until recently, Ysabel contributed a small income from selling cosmetics through a company called Esika, similar to Mary Kay or Avon.  Six months ago, a friend invited her to her village bank, and Ysabel went to a meeting just to meet new people.  While she was at the meeting she became inspired and thought \u2018I could do this, I could start a real business!\u2019  She loves to cook and decided to turn this passion into a means of building capital.  She now prepares a different dessert each week, such as picarones (similar to a doughnut), mazamorra (made with corn and fruit), and arroz con leche, and sells them from a cart on the street.  She also cooks carne de res, a type of meat.  <P>\r\n\r\nYsabel and her husband have four children, ages 18, 15, 11, and 2.  Her oldest is studying cosmetology.  Isabel\u2019s parents are getting older and now live with her family, so she has two additional people to care for.  She is still selling cosmetics, but is focusing on her new business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow large sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy more medicines, such as Chestcof, Strepsils, Mucolyn, Hedex and others","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T12:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T13:22:03Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970669},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886886},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436146},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130419},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100442.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027221}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T13:22:03Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":74449,"name":"Sarin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sarin U. is a villager in Treuy Troeng village in Kandal Province.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating his transportation service-based business. Orlando has been engaged in his business for over one year and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Orlando joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Orlando has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Orlando is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to expand his vehicle transportation service business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Orlando from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She requested this loan to buy more merchandise such as beauty products and also corn for making her tamales.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International:\r\n \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Por esta raz\u00f3n Nile emprendi\u00f3 un negocio desde hace 1 a\u00f1os, donde vende refrescos y pasabocas, adem\u00e1s de tener 2 vitrinas surtidas de artesan\u00edas que elabora con sus propias manos y  de mercanc\u00edas variadas. Su principal mercado son las madres de los ni\u00f1os que atiende su hermana, quien es madre comunitaria, pues pertenece al programa del Instituto colombiano de Bienestar familiar, organismo estatal, dedicado a la protecci\u00f3n  y el cuidado de ni\u00f1os, en  la primera infancia, mientras sus padres trabajan. Nile elabora con sus propias manos accesorios femeninos, collares, pulseras a clientes que le pagan en dos o tres partidas quincenales. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es su insuficiente capital de trabajo, para responder a sus clientes de inmediato, porque la  mayor parte de las ventas las hace a cr\u00e9dito, debe esperar recuperar sus cuentas por cobrar para poder consentir a su clientela y esto no lo ha logrado. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 pasabocas y materias primas para producir sus artesan\u00edas, porque tiene collares y pulsos encargados por vendedores al detalle, a quines desea convertir en sus principales clientes, porque este es un enorme mercado.

She is an enterprising young woman who lives in the town of Puerto Colombia, located on the shore. It has a lot of tourism because it has a lot of beaches that foment businesses such as restaurants and many individual sellers of food, drinks, artisanal crafts, and paintings, among other formal and informal activities in this town. That is why Nile started a business a year ago where she sells beverages and snacks. She also has two display cases full of artisanal crafts made by her own hands, as well as various merchandise. Her main market is the mothers of the children her sister takes care of. She is a community mother who belongs to the Colombian Institute of Family Wellbeing, a government organization dedicated to the protection and care of young children while their parents work. Nile makes women's accessories, necklaces, and bracelets with her own hands for customers who pay her over two or three pay periods. Her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital to respond to her customers immediately. She does most of her sales on credit, and she has to wait to recover the money that's owed to be able to serve her customers and she hasn't been able to do this. That is why now she is getting a Kiva loan. With it, she will buy snacks and raw materials to make her artisanal crafts, because some retailers have ordered necklaces and bracelets from her, and she wants to make them her main customers, as this is a huge market.    Nlie works to achieve her dream of increasing her family's wellbeing everyday. Her family consists of her husband and two children aged 11 and 9. She has a profit margin of no less than 30% and an inventory turnover of 5 days.

<em>tontines<\/em>.\u00a0 Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <em>tontines<\/em> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.\u00a0 Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.\u00a0 However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.\u00a0 This has prevented the traditional <em>tontines<\/em> from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.\u00a0 Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM)

She has been running this business for more than three years.  This activity is her principal source of income, and through it, she provides food and education for her children and pays for her rented house.\r\n\r\nSix months ago, the entrepreneur took a loan from FSMA because supplies had been running low in her business.  With the funds, she purchased clothing in bulk which she sold succesfully.  The loan helped her to give a new \u00b4giro\u00b4 to the business and she was able to make a lot of profits and repaid the loan in due time.  She also opened a bank account and learned to save money for any unforeseen event.

His business is in a shopping mall in Juliaca.  He sells jewelry and his store is one of the most popular because he offers beautiful, high-quality items; this has led to the growth in his business.  What Sixto likes best about his work is chatting with his customers; he has been in this line of work for 3 years.  What he considers to be the most difficult part of the job is guarding his jewels because there are always those around who would like to rob him.  For later in the future, he expects to enlarge his site so that he can sell more items.  This is his first loan with MFP and he knows that he must make his repayments on time if he wants to have access to future loans.

It is found in the community of San Jer\u00f3nimo Tianguismanalco in the state of Puebla. This communty is distinctive because because most of its population works in informal businesses since they don't have the possibility of working in industries or businesses. They get ahead with their work effort.  \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of 13 members and this is the first time that they have asked for a loan from CREDICOMUN.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avelina Mu\u00f1oz Lim\u00f3n was chosen to be the treasurer of the group because of her perservering character. Like a good head of household, she has been able to overcome adversities that have come up in her life.  Her business is just two years old. It's a humble little lunch diner. Her clients call her   Do\u00f1a Velita. Her main clients are the children from the nearby elementary school. She gives them cake and milkshakes at a very low price since most of them come from farm families. The loan will be used to buy a little table and some chairs to give her customers better service. \r\n\r\nThanks to this she has been able to get her financial committments and her family ahead. She has no education and that has meant that she has had to make twice the effort.  A year ago she became a widow and that same year, due to the vicissitudes of life, she lost one her children, an 18 year old who lived with her. Thanks to family support, she has been able to face this emotional and financial adversity. Her pillars of strength: 2 daughters and a son. Thanks to her participation in the communal loans, she has developed and maintained her financial activity. She does not ask for more than she can pay back.  She feels satisfied with her accomplishments because she has recovered confidence in herself. At the the time she asked for this loan, she felt enthusiastic and truly interested in this new project. She is interested in having a calm life and being able to continue for many more years with her business.   \r\n\r\nShe remarks that she wants to grow her business, adding a wider variety of products but always committing only the profits that she makes.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

The head of the group is Macoura T., whose activities are farming and breeding of cattle and sheep. \n\nThe area where he lives played a substantial part in his choosing this activity. He is mainly interested in the lucrative aspect of his work and the potential for profits. \n\nThe group became a member of the Yoff branch in November 2010 through the signing of a partnership agreement between U-IMCEC and Al Ouma, a large national organization. \n\nThey are seeking a loan of 2,250,000 francs for the purchase of seeds and livestock to expand their activities. They are hoping that an increase in revenue will help them to improve the living conditions of their respective families. \n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.

To make a living, Lolita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.

Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC.

She also sold corn, potatoes, \u201cchicha de jora\u201d (a traditional beverage of the area that is made of corn), yogurt, and cheese.  She took her products to the city of Cusco to sell.\r\n\r\nNow Benedicta has changed businesses.  She raises small animals like guinea pigs.  She used the small amount of capital that she had to prepare to raise animals and to build a small shed.  She started raising seven guinea pigs.  She currently has 15 guinea pigs.  The specialists in the Anta municipality are training her.\r\n\r\nThe next loan that Benedicta hopes to receive is for 1,000 soles.  At the present time the shed is modestly set up with the basic necessities.  She would like to use the money to plant grass on her farm, which is at the side of her house.  Grass is good food for the guinea pigs.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married to Domitilia, who is 48, and he has 6 children.  The family has their own home which is located in the community of Vista Alegre Alta, an annex of the Kimbiri district. Feliciano is the one who supports his family.  From the time that he was very young his parents taught him to work on the farm.  He is a farmer who has 5 hectares of land where he cultivates coffee plants and pineapple, fruits that grow in this forest area near the Rio Apurimac Valley.  He has been farming his own lands for 25 years, and during harvest times he has the support of his children and he also hires workers so that he can extract his fruit more rapidly.  What he likes most about his work is harvesting the fruit of the plants, because in this way he feels that his months of hard work are being rewarded with quality fruit.  What he considers most difficult is transporting his products from the farm to the collection centers that are located in the city of San Francisco, a place where the best prices are offered for his coffee beans and pineapples.  The difficulty he faces is that he does not have enough money to cover all of the advance payments that he must make to the workers who help him with the harvest.  For this reason, he has come to the MFP institution to request a loan.  But now his priority is to cultivate more pineapple plants since he has 1 hectare of land that is not cultivated.  This is his 7th loan with MFP, and he feels that this support will help him a lot to make progress with his work.  In his communal bank he is a member who is very well-liked by his fellow group members, since he is very supportive of them.  With the 1,000 Peruvian soles requested he will pay for workers so that they can assist him in harvesting his coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":728270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers to help him with his coffee harvest.

She lives in her own house with her husband, who works as a bricklayer and carpenter. Heriberta has a small locale in her house where she sells beverages, water and chips. She needs more things so that things can improve for her a little. She needs an investment to buy other things as well that her store needs, such as: eggs and ham, which sell well, because they are far from town and a lot of people need them.

quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon. M. runs a small tailoring workshop with her husband in the Nkwen market. With this loan, she plans to buy more material for sewing. She also plans to do marking (embroidery) of dresses and clothing. Her business plan shows she will invest 10,000 CFA (approximately $20 USD) of her own savings as well.  \r\n \r\nThis will be M.'s third loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2006. She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices. She buys in bulk which causes the price to be minimal and sews things herself with the help of her husband. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nPart of the profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of M.'s children. And the other part will be used for medication and food for her large family. M. does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments, every two weeks.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

C. sells popular consumable goods.  She has a small grocery store that is located in the neighbourhood of Trozos. Since she established her own business, it has grown also and has helped with the household expenses.  It is very clear that her business is very good: her store is located in an area where there are very few grocery stores and as a result she doesn't have much competition and this is the her business' secret.  The area where she lives is an area with very few economic resources and the majority of the population are very poor people, which means that she has to sell her products at very low prices in order to make sufficient sales.

She is 36 years old and lives with her partner and their three children. Two of her children are adolescents, while the youngest is just a year and a half old. Maria Mercedes works on her family farm, where she has been growing yucca and bananas for the past eight or nine years. After harvesting the crops, she sells them at the local market. Though Pilcopata is a very small town and consists of little more than a few blocks of houses and stores along a dirt road, its market is quite new and modern. Pilcopata receives a lot of traffic, since all travelers coming to surrounding towns come into Pilcopata first by bus. \r\n\r\nMaria Mercedes is requesting a loan of 2000 soles. She will use most of the loan money to pay her field hands. She usually employs two to three people during harvest time, and pays each worker 25 soles per day.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The group is comprised of 13 members with low incomes.  They are very hard-working and have the expectation of achieving more income.  The women have had a friendship for a long time; they know each other through their businesses and as neighbors.  \r\n\r\nThey work in different types of commercial activities like a grocery store, selling bread, cakes, cell phones, shoes, cosmetics, and making articles of clothing.  Some have fixed stands and others are street vendors.  If they have competitors, the members have the ability to move their stands and to diversity their merchandise to be able to get a daily income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise, supplies, and tools to help them improve their daily income.  For example, getting an electric sewing machine would really help Silvie to deliver her work more quickly.  This would improve her daily income to support her children.  She would be able to give them everything she always dreamed about, a better education and a better future for the whole family.\r\n\r\nAs far as their loan experience goes, the members are in their fourth cycle.  They show a great desire to keep growing, honesty, and responsibility in their payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Mrs. Bernarda owns a food business, which she started three years ago in order to help support her family. Even though the business is not very old, she has 26 years of experience selling food. Her mother taught her at a very young age that she had to learn to earn a living and would send her out to the street to sell tortillas and sometimes bread. She has asked for the loan in order to buy a large enough supply of staple grains to avoid the price fluctuations of these items.

He lives in his own house in the Dallan neighborhood, San prefecture. He has been in the buisness of selling cereal for 30 years now, and he has been working for himself at the grand market of San for 20 years. Amadou is very much in demand during the weekly fairs in San and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nTo increase his business, he decided to turn to micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. He is on his third personal loan. Mr. Amadou K. plans to buy 4 tons of husked rice, 2 tons of pearl millet, 3.5 tons of millet and 2 tons of beans. He obtains his supplies from the wholesalers in San, but with this increase in his capital, he plans to buy directly from the producers. \r\n\r\nHe sells everyday at the  grand market in San and at the weekly fairs to customers who are both men and women, on credit  or in cash. He hopes to make a monthly profit of 130,000 CFA francs which he plans to use to repay the loan, pay for his children's schooling, buy food and and invest the rest in other income-producing activities. His goal is to ask for a bigger loan which will allow him to expand his business, increase his turnover and improve his quality of life.

They have three children who are 8 to 20 years old. One of the children has his own family and the other two are currently going to school. Annabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to pirchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and future family needs. Annabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
