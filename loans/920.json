She cultivates plantain, yucca and papaya plants, which are the most heavily consumed staples in the region. She lives near the Arenal Volcano in the northern zone of Costa Rica, and began planting pepper plants 10 years ago. Her crops are doing very well, thanks to support from a local agriculture initiative program. Maria Teresa works with her partner, and their children are now grown and live on their own. Her farming and hard work have helped support her family, and she is a very humble, hardworking person who wants to grow her operation with Propica (the company that purchases her peppers and crops). \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago Maria Teresa came to the region, and received a parcel of land in a settlement with the Agrarian Development Institute. She has raised a family and farmed her land through much effort and hard work, and her family has lived off the income she has made selling her crops. She has her own house, and has worked to support her children in their pursuits.\r\n\r\nPresently, she is growing papaya and plantain crops, and is living off money from the sale of her produce. The local agriculture program Maria is a part of is encouraging farmers in the northern region to plant pepper crops, a crop that Maria used to cultivate several years ago. She wants to get back into growing peppers, and hopes this will help her generate additional income and increase her farming operation to better support her family.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer with much experience, Maria Teresa has her own land and a stable business. She wants to venture into planting peppers, a crop that she grew a decade ago, and she hopes to sign a contract with Propica for the purchase of her

Adeline is 34 years old and married to a man named Paul.  The couple has four children, all in school and under their care.  Adeline left school at the primary level.  To meet her and her family's needs, Adeline is a hairstylist, a business she learned and has been practicing for about 15 years in her salon.  In addition to hairstyling, Adeline sells extensions and hair products at her salon.  She buys her supplies in the region.

The couple has four children, some of them attend school and all are their dependents. Jeanne lives together with her children and her husband and together they provide for the household expenses. Jeanne did not attend school. To meet her needs and those of her family, Jeanne has been selling clothes and body ointments from her home for the last six years. At the same time, Jeanne also sells drinks. She gets her supplies from a town in Benin. \r\n\r\nThis loan will certainly allow Jeanne and her group Jesusmide to enhance the level of their activity and increase their customers and income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1153421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T01:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T01:10:19Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filom\u00e8ne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":270000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38800},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":37200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.7,"local_amount":77600,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77628.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326638},{"amount":71.85,"local_amount":38800,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":38814.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083677},{"amount":71.85,"local_amount":38800,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":38814.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318072},{"amount":80.74,"local_amount":43600,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43615.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926649},{"amount":74.48,"local_amount":40220,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40234.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059563},{"amount":57.38,"local_amount":30980,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":30991.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449518}],"funded_date":"2012-08-23T22:31:24Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T09:38:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronique Fourment","image":442735}},{"id":453724,"name":"Mario Clemente","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Mario  es una persona muy trabajadora indican sus  vecinos, vive en concubinato y  tiene cuatro hijos, alquila un cuarto en Ivirgarzama para vivir, cada d\u00eda ingresa a su trabajo a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 11 de la noche, dependiendo de las impertinencias del tiempo, la Asociaci\u00f3n de transporte Moto Taxi \" 2 de Agosto\", a la cual esta afiliado hace 15 a\u00f1os cuenta con diferentes paradas, donde la gente acude a solicitar este servicio, el d\u00eda que trabaja mas es Domingo, porque  en la zona es d\u00eda de feria y transita much\u00edsima gente, este d\u00eda es donde tiene buenos ingresos, para iniciar esta actividad, se compro una motocicleta de medio uso, ahora quiere reemplazar su herramienta de trabajo por una nueva que le dar\u00e1 menos problemas, por tal razon, es que se apersono a nuestra oficina para solicitar un credito, esto le ayudara a tener menos gastos, debido a que no necesitara contar con los servicios de un mecanico lo que le resta sus ingresos.","en":"Mario is very hardworking person according to his neighbors, he lives with his common law partner and has four children, he rents a room in Ivirgarzama, each day he goes to work from 5 AM to 11 PM, depending on how time gets in the way.

She is obliged to sell off all of it because of her capital and yet she has experience in this domain and a faithful clientele. For this reason she is requesting a loan which will give her the opportunity to buy cartons of fish and shrimp to expand her sales, satisfy her customers, and increase her profit which she will reinvest in her business, since she would like to open up a fish shop in the near future.

Bogor Selatan is a city around 1 hours' driving from Indonesia\u2019s capital city, Jakarta. Although she is young, as in most Indonesian traditional families, she is married and has two children. Her first one has passed away, and now her second child is 2 years old. \r\n\r\nGyna owns a small shop selling Indonesian household needs starting with grocery items like rice, eggs, cooking oil and margarine, and going onto toiletries, cleaning tools and, of course, airtime prepaid minute. By selling airtime prepaid minutes, she met with Ruma [Kiva's Field Partner]. \r\n\r\nSince Ruma began bringing more income into her family by selling the minutes, Gyna agreed to try Ruma\u2019s new product. This new product will help Gyna serve customers better from her shop. It is called a <i>Loket Ruma<\/i> business. The premise in becoming a Loket Ruma agent is to provide a bill payment service for customers. Gyna hopes that people will come to her shop, not only to buy groceries or prepaid minutes, but also to pay electricity bills and motorcycle installments, to buy electricity vouchers for new house types and, last but not least, to pay credit card bills. She will be using an electronic data capture (EDC) machine to help create the payment transaction. This loan from Kiva will be used to pay the guarantee deposit money for an EDC. \r\n\r\nThe reason she wants to give the new product a try is to expand her business to the next level by maximizing what she can give to her customers. Another thing is: because this is an emerging product in the community. The EDC machine is simple, affordable capital. Ruma\u2019s money collection system allows Gyna to stay in her shop and Ruma\u2019s field officer comes to collect the money to become her capital again. She loves it!  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1151615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to pay for a deposit on an electronic data capture (EDC) machine for her bill payment business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T02:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T02:40:13Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-28T08:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3083501.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172433}],"funded_date":"2012-07-28T14:44:15Z","paid_date":"2013-03-28T08:56:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":454468,"name":"Teresinha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresinha is 29 years old and she is married.

Although the price of feed is currently very expensive, Ketut expects the sale of four pigs would gain a satisfactory profit and can increase the income of her husband to support her family and helping her children's school fees.\n\nIn the current period, there was a decrease of the loan amount.

It is a food of indigenous origin based on a cornmeal dough wrapped in leaves of this same vegetable, which are cooked or boiled in water. The result is a very healthful food. This business is part of the tradition of his mother, who worked for 15 years from the patio of her home to produce them for restaurants, stores, and other small businesses. Jos\u00e9 has always helped his mother in the sale of fritters and bollos, both accompaniments of the preferred foods of families at breakfast time and during dinner. Some time ago he had to take over the business himself, since his mother became sick. Now he has the daily goal of generating enough income to sustain the family, as well as studying and becoming a good professional. His dream is to make his microbusiness grow and generate more income every day, but his working capital is insufficient to broach new markets, which is his greatest challenge.  This is why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that he has had with Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy raw materials and ingredients such as corn, cheese, and oil, since he plans to increase his sales of bollos, cheese turnovers, and empanadas, opening new markets in which he can obtain regular customers. With his Kiva loan he plans to multiply his investment as well as achieve his dream of prosperity, which he won't abandon for even an

Moreover, she supplements her family income by selling biscuits. She has been in this business for ten years, earning about 20,000 KHR per day from current business. \r\n\r\nShe is lacking capital for running the business. This remains the main challenge for Yoerung. Yoeurng\u2019s group consists of four members, three females and one male; she is the group leader. She is the second cycled client with Kiva\u2019s partner, while the other three members are just the first cycled clients. \r\n\r\nYoeurng has successfully used the past loan to make her living in a better condition. Yoeurng is requesting a new loan of 1,200,000 KHR and will use her portion to buy more ingredients (i.e. rice, salt, sugar, and a bigger cooking pot) for supporting her food selling business. She hopes to gradually expand her business so as to earn more income for her family\u2019s

For the past 2 years, Faimah has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells hardware items like cement and iron sheets. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faimah has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more hardware items like iron sheets for resale, and will help Faimah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Faimah hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build more rental houses. \r\n\r\nFaimah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Faimah who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

","en":"Magellan is a 37-year-old man who is engaged and the father of 3 children aged between 2 and 8. Two of his children already attend school. Magellan is a retailer and has been selling mobile phones and accessories for 3 years in one of the districts of the economic capital. The sale of mobile phone accessories is a profitable area of business, but Magellan faces the problem of having insufficient inventory with which to fulfill demand, as his capital does not enable him to restock quickly enough for the customers who are left waiting.

Yolanda es micro empresaria y hace todo lo que puede para aumentar sus ingresos. Vende ropa y zapatos de segunda mano, vende frituras en las noches (negocio muy popular en la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, ya que muchos en vez de hacer cena compran carne frita de res, cerdo o pollo acompa\u00f1ada de pl\u00e1tano macho verde frito) y adem\u00e1s vende jugos naturales.

It still has not been completed, but she is building a bathroom and plans to continue with a bedroom.  In the photo we can see a block wall and behind her, in place of a wall, she uses curtains to divide the space.\r\n\r\nYolanda is entrepreneurial and does whatever she needs to increase her income.  She sells second-hand clothing and shoes in the day, and she sells fried food in the evenings (this is a very popular business in the Dominican Republic since instead of buying a meal, many people buy fried beef, pork, or chicken accompanied with fried green plantains.)  She also sells natural fruit juices.\r\n\r\nShe operates her three businesses from her home.  Yolanda is married and has six children between the ages of 30 and 12 years old.  The three youngest (20, 17, and 12) still live with her.  The 17 year old and 12 year old are in school and they play baseball and dream to one day be picked up by a team in the major leagues.

Here she sells beauty products like shampoo, protective hair creams, infant clothing, paper products and female accessories. In this same place she has added ice cream and beverage sales with which she generates additional income, taking advantage of the clientele that she has gained with her good service. \r\n\r\nWith her business she receives profits that allow her to obtain the necessary resources to support her for a year. The well-being of her home is shaped by her husband who supports her and her three children between the ages of 1 and 7 years old. Jeimy offers varied merchandise for cash and on credit. She has often provided separate payment plans in which prior to taking the item with them, the clients pay little by little until they have completely paid for it. Jeimy usually makes her purchases in stores where they offer her discounts and products of good quality that are sold to her.

He works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to two clients per day, since he is a bit of a workaholic.

He is thirty years old and lives in the city of Ica, a city known for its very warm and friendly climate. As a result of the climate, there is lots of agriculture in the area. Specifically, cotton, grapes, and asparagus, among other crops, are cultivated here. We can also find tourist spots, such as the beautiful Laguna de Huacachina, which is located in the middle of impressive dunes where adventure sports such as sandboarding are popular. Like a good Peruvian, Jose enjoys eating one of his favorite delicious dishes, chicken and rice. Jose studied to be an electrician, but he would have liked to study in a university.\r\n\t\r\nFrom day to day, Jose works at his business repairing and selling cellular phones and their accessories. He works around eight hours a day, and he can help up to thirty-five customers in a day. He believes his business is going well because he is very responsible and courteous with his customers.\r\n\r\nJose is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since it is through the help they have provided him that he will be able to purchase electric equipment such as electricity meters, screwdrivers, and pliers, among other tools necessary to offer his services.

He has 7 children ranging in age from 15 to 26 years, and he dreams that they will become successful people. He has 15 years of experience in manufacturing furniture for dining rooms, bedrooms, and living rooms.  He has his own cabinetmaker's shop, located on the side of his house, which he started based on his uncle's teaching of the trade. The products in greatest demand are  entertainment centers, as well as bedroom and dining sets.  For that reason, although he can build all the lines, recently he has focused on these products.  In his business he handles all of the labor, purchasing and marketing: He purchases the wood, the polish, does the cut preparation and assembly, as well as the finishing and sales.  He completes his sales at small stores located in a commercial corridor in the center of town as well as through people referred to him via the market.  His daily work is intense.  He begins his work at 7:00 am and continues to 7:00 pm each day and strives to perfect his technique in order to help his family get ahead.  Currently he is applying for a loan from Kiva, the first financing that he is requesting from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the loan he will buy wood, paint, sand and plywood in volumes that can increase production and improve his sales volume, which is what makes the Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1150832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood, paint, sand and plywood in volumes that can increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44971},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46021},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":47094},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":48193},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49318},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50469},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":51646},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52851},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":54084},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.55,"local_amount":35917,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":38325.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395563},{"amount":5.41,"local_amount":9023,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9628.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775354},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":72533,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77396.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387349},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":95459,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101859.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130532},{"amount":41.91,"local_amount":69855,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74538.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519402},{"amount":130.33,"local_amount":217213,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":231777.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968408}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T13:21:20Z","paid_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":454761,"name":"Julienne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julienne is 37 years old.

She is nineteen years old, and she contributes her earnings to help with household bills. Her home is located in the city of Ica, a city known for its very warm and friendly climate. As a result of the climate, there is lots of agriculture in the area. Specifically, cotton, grapes, and asparagus, among other crops, are cultivated here. We can also find tourist spots, such as the beautiful Laguna de Huacachina, which is located in the middle of impressive dunes where adventure sports such as sandboarding are popular. In her free time, Jessica likes to listen to music, and above all she enjoys eating one of her favorite delicious dishes, chicken and rice. Due to her limited economic resources, she only attended high school, but she would have liked to study law.\r\n\r\nJessica works with lots of enthusiasm as a sales promoter in a store in her city. Since she helps her family with her earnings, she works around eight hours a day and can help up to thirty customers in a day. She believes that her work is going well for her because she is very responsible and always helps her customers with lots of kindness.\r\n\r\nJessica is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to the help they have provided her she will be able to purchase a gas stove. Currently, her family has a kerosene stove, which, due to the flammable nature of the fuel, had a small accident a couple days ago. Thankfully, it did not get out of hand, and as a result, with this improvement she will be able to provide a better quality of life to her family, and more importantly, more safety. This way, she will be able to continue working so she will be able to realize her biggest dream: \u201cHave her own home and continue to help her family.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1150891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a gas stove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.2,"local_amount":65.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":68.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351522},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":68.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109164},{"amount":28.91,"local_amount":72.26,"processed_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345344},{"amount":29.63,"local_amount":74.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":77.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954559},{"amount":31.27,"local_amount":78.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":82.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088958},{"amount":32.18,"local_amount":80.45,"processed_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478523},{"amount":33.53,"local_amount":83.81,"processed_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031216},{"amount":35.71,"local_amount":89.28,"processed_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":93.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775734},{"amount":74.52,"local_amount":186.3,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":195.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372888649},{"amount":39.53,"local_amount":98.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":103.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381663599},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":103.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":108.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390774245}],"funded_date":"2012-08-06T22:21:58Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:56:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim O'Reilly","image":null}},{"id":454770,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 34 years old and lives in the town of Msambweni in the coastal region of Kenya.

Two years ago, he decided to generate his own income by setting up a hall for video games, directed to generating entertainment for the new generations. Today he has succeeded in solidifying a small customer base, where youths and children are his principal customers. Every day from 8:30 in the morning until 9:30 at night, he works at his business, which every day produces more satisfaction for him, since it generates income and he identifies in it an important potential for growth that he want to reach. Randy keeps up-to-date, and for this reason his offerings are the most modern and up-to-date videos and games, and so his clientele continues to grow. His present challenge is to obtain working capital to permit him to innovate and strengthen his customer base even more. This is exactly the reason why he has turned to a Kiva loan, which will be his first financing through Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and which he will use to buy an Xbox, a Play Station, and two channels of video games. With the investment of his Kiva loan, he will update his offerings and offer his customers opportunities to access modern games, which are the most fun for youths and children, while Randy continues to increase his income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1150684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to buy an Xbox, a Play Station, and two channels of video games.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Baranoa-Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Randy David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.23,"local_amount":167300,"processed_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":171145.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775348},{"amount":553.77,"local_amount":962700,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":984827.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071240}],"funded_date":"2012-07-30T14:38:03Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":455267,"name":"Mamadou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\n\uf0fc\tMr  Mamadou est  \u00e0 quelques kilom\u00e8tres de l\u2019IMF, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de famille il vit avec ses fr\u00e8res et sa famille.
