She is a seller of cassava flour from an agricultural store situated in the Birere shopping centre. She began this business when she was young; she was married at the time. Her husband died following a short illness which provoked a heart attack.\r\nThe main difficulty with this business, she says, is that she often sells on credit - with the risk of not being paid.\r\nThis new loan will allow her to stock up with thirty sacks of cassava flour. Due to the loans from Hekima, she is able to fund her children's education and\/or marriage as the case may be. With these loans, she wants to grow the size of her working capital.\r\nShe thanks Hekima for its support for the independence of women small entrepreneurs.

I came to Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia, to undergo training so that I can start running my own shop. I have successfully completed this training and now need a loan to start running my shop.\r\n\r\nI intend to open my shop in my hometown of Chipata, because I feel the community there will benefit in having easy access to send and receive money to and from their friends and relatives. Also, the way I look at it, Chipata is a city in waiting and people there have caught up with technology and need as many mobile money transfer shops as possible.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan I will be able to start running my own shop. I will pay rental for the trading booth, which I will be using for transactions. I will also use the money to brand my booth, hire at least one person, and get some chairs and phones.\r\n\r\nI am very excited to get a Kiva loan and start running my own business because the profits that I will start earning will enable me to provide a good life and education for my son.\r\n\r\nIn the video, a representative from Mobile Transactions interviews Mwila."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1152293,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2677,"youtubeId":"hnHx2HtHGmg","title":"Kiva Borrower Mwila from Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1152293},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to open up a mobile money transfer shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":24271000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":24271000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":476.93,"local_amount":2315125,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2317891.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533419},{"amount":487.1,"local_amount":2364500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2367325.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132519},{"amount":386.55,"local_amount":1876375,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-26T09:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1878616.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281413},{"amount":1304.75,"local_amount":6333529,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6341096.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657052},{"amount":213.92,"local_amount":1045000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T17:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1046248.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":347220332},{"amount":205.39,"local_amount":997000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T21:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":998191.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355983434},{"amount":209.1,"local_amount":1015000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T13:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1016212.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364677498},{"amount":246.75,"local_amount":1212000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T13:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1213448.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":373062089},{"amount":314.96,"local_amount":1567210,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1569082.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.9,"payment_id":381854140},{"amount":415.35,"local_amount":2040340,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2042777.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.97,"payment_id":390712273},{"amount":423.57,"local_amount":2056100,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2058556.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399957696},{"amount":291.44,"local_amount":1414690,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T21:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1416380.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410241824},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":34131,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T01:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":34170.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":429659114}],"funded_date":"2012-08-02T08:49:41Z","paid_date":"2013-12-18T01:20:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":454868,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is one of Esperanza Internacional's entrepreneurs.

She hopes the business will grow and she will become a successful pig breeder.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1153070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two superior piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T22:00:05Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":15000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1600,"local_amount":15000000,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":15183999.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339560458}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T20:48:08Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T16:43:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":454957,"name":"Tati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tati is 49 years old and lives in Gilimanuk, West Bali.

His home is made of adobe and reeds. With this support he will be able to buy reed panels and plastic so he can repair his roof. Because of the rainy season and as a result of the house's materials, water leaks through the roof and at times floods. In this way he will be able to improve his family's quality of life and continue working to make his largest dream come true: to study for a college degree, become a professional and give his family a better quality of life and his brothers an education.

This meant that during her lifetime, as the eldest daughter, she has had to help her mother with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is living alone and independently. However, every month she helps her mother by contributing in some way to the expenses of her younger siblings. \r\n\r\nShe has the desire to improve herself, so despite her scarce resources, she is going to university, studying for a degree in industrial engineering. She is paying for her studies with what she earns from selling her products; these earnings being a function of her business's performance from month to month.\r\n\r\nShe is used to getting up early, in order to go to classes, and as soon as she finishes her university hours, she goes to drop off catalogs at the various places where they know her, because of the time she has been selling her products.

She makes physical education shirts and end of the year student shirts for these customers.  At the same time that her business is progressing, challenges are also presented such as having to buy in bulk and in cash, but also having to wait for her customers to pay in order to take on new clients.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she has approached crediKiva.  This is the second loan that Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has given her.  With this loan she will buy materials in greater volume in order to make the most of discounts and come through for her clients.

She is married and has three children between 1 and 9 years of age.\r\n\r\nDorothy has made a request of a loan of 41,600 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy and insure a dairy cow. She says this will give a boost to her dairy farming. She aims at having a farm of ten dairy cows in the future and a vehicle to help her in making deliveries of her produce to the markets. She will also be able to offer transportation services to other farmers.\r\n\r\nDorothy sees lack of capital and defined local markets for farm produce as the main challenges in her business.

The loan will be used to buy more phones to sell, and will help Zaidha to generate greater profits and allow her to build a house. Zaidha hopes that, in the future, she will be able to own a bigger phone shop. \r\n\r\nZaidha is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Zaidha who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1153316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more phones to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Namutumba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-07-29T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-28T06:50:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":455060,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita is involved im agriculture.

His productive process begins when he makes the handle, processes the bristles, ties, paints and markets them. He puts special emphasis on pre-sale efforts, so that he can adjust his production to the demand. He sells from Tuesday to Friday, and works 8 hours a day.

","en":"Blanca, 42, operates a small food business, making and selling \"cholaos\", a kind of fruit cocktail popular in the Cauca Valley region, that she makes with crushed ice, tropical fruits, cream, condensed milk and peanuts.  She has slowly grown the business over several years and now has 3 food stalls in Barranquilla, a city known for soft breezes, sun and a people as warm as the region's climate.  Blanca's three children, who range in age from 17- to 22-years old, have helped her make the business a success.  Blanca is applying to Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan that she will use to buy the supplies she needs--milk, a blender, tableware and glass containers--to operate her business.  For the future, she tells us that she wants to add fruit juices to her menu.  She can make the juices from tropical fruits that are native to this area.  Her biggest challenge, she says, is growing her business to parts of the city where she's not now known."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1151673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for her food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-29T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-28T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775362},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387357},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994183},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130540},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519408},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071250},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497463},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527283},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":96850.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928058},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":282497,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":290546.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705243}],"funded_date":"2012-08-03T19:36:02Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":455129,"name":"Geofrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey is 44 years old, married with six children aged between one and 23 years old.

She is 42 years old and a widow.\r\n\r\nPhilom\u00e8ne did not attend school. She is the mother of two children, both in school. One of the children is still in her care. Philom\u00e8ne lives alone with her child and makes sure the different family needs are met. Philom\u00e8ne has been selling \"boules de p\u00e2tes\" (made from corn starch) for about fifteen years out of her home. This business enables her to respond without much difficulty to her needs, as well as those of her child. Philom\u00e8ne gets her supplies from a city in Benin.\r\n\r\nSeeking to satisfy her customers and to grow her sales and revenues, Philom\u00e8ne, along with the other members of the group MASSAVO, is requesting a seventh loan from ALID\u00e9. The first six loan were indeed repaid. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1154773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-07-29T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-28T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philom\u00e8ne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigitte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.69,"local_amount":63300,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":63351.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326650},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30024.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318084},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":60049.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926661},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":28900,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":28923.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449530},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":30264,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":30288.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347002358},{"amount":51.62,"local_amount":27536,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":27558.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355744705}],"funded_date":"2012-08-05T00:23:34Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T08:45:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":455204,"name":"Nickson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nickson lives in the Mombasa area of Coast province.

Julia is a friendly, hardworking, enthusiastic person who works tirelessly with her husband to sustain their family. As a child, she worked to support her parents and siblings; so although she would have liked to pursue a professional career, she couldn't do so. In her free time, she loves to cook and sometimes makes a delicious, traditional chili pepper chicken dish to share with her family. \r\n\r\nWith much effort, enthusiasm, and her husband's support, Julia started her small business selling cakes two years ago. She begins preparing the cakes early in the morning and works about 10 hours a day. She loves her job, and her customers come back for her friendly demeanor and her delicious products.\r\n\r\nJulia is very grateful to Kiva lenders whose support will allow her to buy a small oven, cake stands, platters, and some ingredients and supplies needed for her business. This way she hopes to increase her sales and income, which she wants to use in the near future to build a house with good materials that will assure her daughter's well-being. Her current home is made of plywood, plastic, matting, and cardboard.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1150671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In her store, she offers internet service, prepaid phone cards, phone calls, transcripts, and photocopies and sells a variety of merchandise such as small appliances, groceries, and so forth. Ruby is a widow and mother of 5 children ages 28 to 40. She has always worked to generate income for her household. When she started her family, her now deceased husband brought merchandise from the Colombian border for her to sell. This is how she accumulated the working capital to start her current small business. Three years ago, she added an internet caf\u00e9 and, slowly, other related services, with which she has prospered in the market.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are her neighbors. She also offers merchandise that she buys wholesale to local shops and other businesses that have become steady customers. Ruby is courageous and strives daily to do a good job, which means her store opens at 8 a.m. and often doesn't close until 10 p.m. Still, she hopes to increase her income to keep improving her circumstances and, therefore, is requesting a loan to buy groceries, small appliances, and supplies for her internet caf\u00e9 and to buy another computer. The loan will increase her working capital, giving her the money to buy highly discounted merchandise when the opportunity arises.

For the past seven years, Gerald has been working hard to manage his farm, which sells plants and food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Gerald has requested a loan of 2000000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

For the past 5 years, Godfrey has been working hard to manage his small business of selling timber. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Godfrey has requested a loan of 300,0000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She is engaged in \"Kalamay making\" for more than twenty years now. \"Kalamay\" is made by extracting coconut milk from grated coconuts twice. Glutinous rice is added to the first batch of coconut milk and the mixture is ground into a paste. Brown sugar is added to the second batch of coconut milk and boiled for several hours to make sweetened coconut paste or latik. The mixture of ground glutinous rice and coconut milk is then poured into the lat\u00edk and stirred until the consistency becomes very thick.

In the future, Sabitri plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. In Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way.  Using a little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture.  With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets.  With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability.

like this because this is the name of the community). The group is is located, in Hato Mayor city, in the eastern part of the country. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their four children.\r\n\r\nAltagracia plans to use her loan to invest in her clothing sales. She has set up a clothing sales business, so she will use her loan to buy new clothes to sell. She hopes to eventually set up a store where her customers can come to her instead.

He has been a farmer since he was a child, since in the place where he lives agriculture is the most represented sector. He learned the trade from his father, whom he helped all his life to grow crops to put bread on the table. Now that he has founded his own home, together with his wife and child, he has to work very hard in order to feed his family. Audelio has also reared pigs for about ten years, something which he also learned from his father, who keeps doing this to this day. They used to do it together but now each has their own pigs. Audelio says that this part of his activity helps a lot to increase his income, since cultivating his land is not enough to give his wife and child the good life they deserve. He buys the products he uses in a nearby town, some eight kilometres from his house; sometimes, he has to do this journey on foot, since transport to the area where his house is located is scarce. When he is loaded with products, he has no choice but to hire a vehicle to take him back to his house, and this is an extra cost, more expensive than walking. He will invest the loan in the purchase of five pigs and meal to feed them. He buys five pigs because it is cheaper and thus he can turn a good profit when he sells the carcases. Then he can buy more and bring more income to his family. The main need this loan fulfils is to enable Audelio to buy more than one pig and to buy meal at the same time: in so doing, he saves money, since he only has to pay for one trip to bring everything home. His life will be greatly improved by this, since he will turn a greater profit when selling the meat, giving him more money with which to buy more products and put more bread on the table. In the future, he plans to repair his home with what money he can save from the profits he will have made; he also hopes to give his daughter a good education and guidance, since he hopes she will have a better life than what he himself had to live through when he was a child. He is very grateful for Kiva's help, since it will enable him to carry out his plans sooner than expected."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1151786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in the town of Cartagena and she has a 25-year-old daughter and she hopes her daughter will be successful in whatever she will undertake. 17 years ago she worked in a fish processing plant for 7 months only because that job was very difficult; notwithstanding this, while looking for job opportunities she was offered a stall and she accepted it to generate some business and to earn money to support her family, composed of her mother and her daughter. This is how she started selling meals and beers, succeeding in gaining some customers whose number has been growing little by little, and this went on for 4 years; however, once she was positioned she was robbed and she had to start in another neighborhood, on a plot of land provided by a friend of hers where she installed a roof, chairs and tables in order to start her activity once again. As her activity was growing she took on her sister and she succeeded in positioning her activity and in saving enough to buy another plot of land that she arranged in order to succeed in having her own house. She then had to hand in the place her shop was located in, and for this reason she had to adapt her own plot of land, opening a restaurant; she then added soft drinks and beer selling, and later on she added liquor selling as well. She will then add a terrace to transform it in a place where her customers can enjoy themselves dancing and to have some fun together. This activity is her only source of income, thanks to which she has progressed as a woman at the head of her household. She has a 12-years\u2019 experience and she is ready to make her activity grow a little more. In order for her sales to increase, she needs to have a stock of soft drinks and liquors at her disposal; a period of many celebrations is approaching, and Orlina needs to be ready to sell the most and earn a better income every day. This is the reason why she is requesting a loan, the first she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy beer, brandy, rum and whiskey in order to diversify her offer by meeting her customers\u2019 tastes and

As\u00ed trabajaron durante 10 meses porque su amigo solicit\u00f3 el local para trabajarlo \u00e9l mismo. As\u00ed fue que   cuando regresaron a la ciudad, con sus pocos ahorros decidieron emprender un negocio de venta de cervezas, refrescos y comidas,  cerca a la terminal de transporte y cuando estaba su negocio en su mejor momento, el due\u00f1o exigi\u00f3 que le regresaran el local. As\u00ed fue como recurrieron a su antiguo negocio de fritangueria, que se convirti\u00f3 en tienda poco a poco, debido  a que   ahora ten\u00edan m\u00e1s experiencia y  se la adicionaron a su actual negocio. \tCuando nuevamente estaban despegando, la ola invernal inund\u00f3 el barrio, donde se encontraban ubicados y salieron damnificados, debiendo  empezar nuevamente y lo hizo prestando dinero, para comprar ranchos v\u00edveres y art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar, con los que logr\u00f3 levantar nuevamente su tienda. El empe\u00f1o de Josefina y su esposo por hacer crecer su negocio y generar m\u00e1s ingresos no cesa, porque tienen 2 hijos, a quienes quieren brindarle cada vez mas un mayor bienestar. En la actualidad su tono amable y cordial, hacen que su clientela llegue diariamente a su tienda y compre, porque adem\u00e1s encuentran muchos art\u00edculos que necesitan en el peso, la medida y la especificaci\u00f3n que estos pueden pagar. As\u00ed que cada d\u00eda los inventarios terminan muy prontamente y Josefina ha observado que ese es su mayor desaf\u00edo: el tener capital de trabajo suficiente y de manera permanente para surtirlo. Raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen arroz, az\u00facar, caf\u00e9, ranchos, enlatados, embutidos, refrescos etc. Con su credikiva los clientes no se mover\u00e1n de su negocio, esperando que Josefina con su sonrisa le venda el producto que necesitan, a un precio que ellos sean capaces de pagarle y esto es lo que hace que su credikiva sea exitoso. ","en":"Josefina and her husband, began selling empanadas and fried arepas in the neighborhood they lived in, but their incomes were only enough to cover their basic needs. For this reason, they took advantage of an offer made by a friend, to rent them a store located in the neighborhood next to the city of Cartagena de Indias. They worked there for 10 months because their friend needed the store back to work there himself. This is why, when they returned to the city, with their little savings, they decided to set up a business selling beer, beverages and food, close to the bus station. And when the business was at its peak, the owner demanded to have the store back. This is why they went back to their old business of selling fried snacks, which little by little, became a store, because they had more experience now and they added it to their current business. When they were taking off again, the cold spell flooded the neighborhood they were located in, and they were affected and had to start over. They did this borrowing money to buy snacks, supplies and items to support the family's basic needs, thanks to which they managed to set up the store again. Josefina and her husband's determination to grow their business and generate more income never stops, because they have 2 children, to whom they want to provide a better living. Currently, their nice and friendly tone, makes the customers get into the store on a daily basis and buy, because they can also find a lot of products they need, in the weight, size and specification they can afford. This is why everyday the stock runs out very early and Josefina has noticed that is their biggest challenge: to have enough working capital permanently to always be stocked up. For this reason, they request a Kiva loan, to buy a larger amount of rice, sugar, coffee, snacks, canned food, sausages, sodas, etc. With their Kiva loan, customers will not leave their store, waiting for Josefina with a smile to sell them the product they need, at a price they can afford. And this is what makes their Kiva loan successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1151823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In past centuries, the pre-Inca Nazca culture developed there. For this reason, we have one of the most visited tourist attractions, the \"Nazca Lines,\" which are are visited by great numbers of tourists, especially because they are extensive geoglyphs, located in the middle of an extensive arid plain, that served as a kind of calendar for that culture.\r\n\r\nNancy is the mother of two daughters, ages 16 and 18.  She and her husband work very hard to raise them. Nancy likes to look after her small plants in her free time, and really likes to eat one of her favorite dishes, the very delicious \"fejol con seco\" (spicy Peruvian dish made with meat and beans).\r\n\r\nNancy works day after day in her small food store, mainly selling fried chicken. She works around eight hours daily, and can serve up to 15 customers a day. She believes her business is going well because of the tasty way she prepares her dishes, and because she serves her customers in a friendly way and with much love.\r\n\r\nNancy is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help they have offered her, she will be able to buy tables and chairs for her business. With this improvement she will be able to serve her customers more comfortably, and above all, improve her income. In this way, she will continue working and striving each day to be able to make her greatest dream a reality: To provide her children with a good education and to have a restaurant."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1151523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

has worked selling handicrafts for 25 years.  Her business is located in one of the markets in Chinandega.  She is the mother of five children: the oldest is 22 years old and the youngest is 8.  Three of them are in school, so she works from Monday to Sunday from eight in the morning until five in the afternoon in order to raise and educate them.\r\n\r\nHer business was started by her husband who is still living and who is the father of her five chilren.  She works making pinatas.  She started this activity on her own, after having watched how pinatas were made and trying to make one, but it did not turn out well.  However, she did not give up, and kept trying until she made a good one. She never went to school to learn how to make a pinata because her family was large and there was no opportunity.  All of her children have followed her example, and make dozens of pinatas every week.  These pinatas are made with a large earthen jar, which is covered with newspapers using the hands, legs and head. They are left to dry for three or four days before being dressed as cartoon characters.  These pinatas are for children's birthday celebrations.  They are filled with many candies, and when it is time to break them the children are given a stick.  The children's eyes are covered with a handkerchief to make the party fun, until the pinatas are broken and all the candy falls out, and the guests throw themselves to the ground to see who can grab the candies.  In her business she also sells hammocks.

And so little by little she generated profit and she was taking new orders for other articles such as cologne, cosmetics and recently working with vitamins and natural products, that a relative sends her from abroad. Her customers are mainly housewives, company employees and the domestic help of her neighbors, which is ongoing. Sales take place by monthly preorders she collects. She also buys articles in the nearby city of Barranquilla and in the Cartagena market square, paying by cash.\r\n\r\nShe has received 2 loans through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which have noticeably increased her working capital and profits, so on a personal level she has achieved greater autonomy and overcome fears in respect to the sales of the products that she offers and therefore she gives thanks to God.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to purchase products in larger quantities in order to get better prices and transfer the savings on to her customers, and upon receiving her earnings, rotating her merchandise each time. Her goal moving forward is to have a facility in her own home, which she doesn\u2019t have yet.\r\n\r\nThis is her third Kiva loan for which she is applying through the foundation and with this investment she plans to buy a display case and supply it with silverware and cologne from North America in which her customers can find a good mixture.

Her family lives in the ger district (a ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) and they own one small brick house. It was built earlier and this year she made renovations to her house such as wall insulation due to the heat loss through its walls, roof, and floor. Now she is planning to extend her house with a second floor. She thinks it will reduce heat loss much more and her family can live in a comfortable and spacious home. She will also replace the floor with a new wooden one. The loan she is taking out will be used to cover the cost of the building materials for her house extension to reduce heat loss and make it more spacious.

","en":"Rubis is 38 years old and is a mother of 3 children between the ages of 7 and 13. With the income from her hardware store, she is able to support her home and strives daily to provide for the welfare of her children. Rubis grew up in a home where she was taught good manners. She also grew in a work environment which influenced her life, understanding that to get ahead she had to be productive. Because of this, when she put together her home once she finished high school and was left without her partner, she initiated an entrepreneurial development. First a friend provided her with goods like bags and footwear. With these she generated earnings with which she was able to move forward for a bit. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 her family was reorganized. By taking advantage of the father of her child's work experience with hardware, she began her own business of this nature and was supported by him to manage the hardware products. This work has gone very well for her because her customer base continues to grow. Her greatest challenge is having the store completely stocked with all of the items that her customers need to buy. This is justly the reason for which she seeks a Kiva loan. This is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will buy cement paint, taking advantage of the rise that construction has made in the surrounding neighborhoods and the fact that there are not businesses like hers to compete with her. Her dream for the future is to have a vehicle for transportation from her business and to transport her children with ease. She dreams to see her children become successful professionals in the future.
