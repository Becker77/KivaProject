This will reflect positively on her business development, especially that this summer the designs are very attractive to her customers, as she claims.

She has an internet caf\u00e9 in her home and offers video games and internet services and also sells stationary items, sweets, and soft drinks. She started this business in 2006, when her husband was let go from a job at an important business in the city. She received help from many people who were supportive of her. A friend, who had closed his own internet caf\u00e9, helped her out with two televisions and a Playstation. Also, a family member bought two televisions on credit, and with this equipment, she began her business. Her customer base grew every day, and Luz added sweets and soft drinks when an important business provided her with a refrigerator. Little by little, her business grew and good things happened in her home. Her husband took advantage of his knowledge of medicines and opened up his own pharmacy business in another part of town. Luz now has 5 computers, 12 televisions, 6 X-Boxes, 5 Playstations, and a vitrine. She also has a good client base, due to her good customer service and her strategic location. Her goal for the future is to expand her business by building a second floor, so she can separate her family\u2019s space from her business space. In order to achieve this, she works without rest, from Monday through Sunday. Her greatest motivation is her 2 children, who are 6 and 10 years old, and whom she wants to see become successful and have a good life. She is currently requesting a loan, which she will use to buy stationary items, sweets, and soft drinks. She will also use it to do some maintenance on her equipment, so that she can continue to have a successful business that her customers will be loyal to and help her achieve her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1152557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

She has three children under her care, some of whom are still at school while the remaining is helping the family's business. \r\n\r\nTo strive for a living, Yorn has been growing paddy rice on two hectares of farmland as the primary source of income. In addition to better feed her family as the single mother, Yorn also grows corns, cucumbers, and cabbages. For the several years that she has been with these businesses, she earns about 12,000 KHR per day. Her main challenges are the fruitless cash-crops caused by the drought and the insects. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle for Yorn with VisionFund. She joins a group of four female members to seek for a new loan in order to overcome her challenges. One of her group members is also a newly joined client, another one is a third cycled client, and the remaining one is a second cycled client. Yorn and the other three group members are applying for 1,000,000 KHR each. \r\n\r\nAs the group leader, Yorn will use her loan portion to buy 5 sacks of fertilizer for her rice field. Moreover, she will use a portion of it to buy 10 chickens and one piglet for raising to earn more income. She hopes to receive more crop yields and to raise her chickens and pig healthfully so that she can earn more income. By doing so, she can save some money to buy a motorbike to support her

Five children are still in school or below schooling age while the remaining three are working at a factory for a low salary. \r\n\r\nTo overcome the family's hardship, Haat and her husband have grown paddy rice on two hectares of farmland for 25 years.  To add more income, she sells Khmer noodles from home whilst her husband works for others for a fee. Together, they are able to earn about 29,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nHaat has borrowed from VisionFund 4 times and she has managed to pay back the full loans with success. The loans have helped her to keep her children at school and set aside some money for emergency cases in the future. \r\n\r\nNow, she is applying for a new loan with VisionFund, Kiva's partner.

Desde sus 15 a\u00f1os ha estado trabajando muy cerca a confeccionistas y desde hace un a\u00f1o, despu\u00e9s de ser empleada decidi\u00f3 independizarse, dando inicio a su sue\u00f1o de convertirse en dise\u00f1adora de modas, aplicando el dinero recibido, producto de haber terminado su contrato de trabajo y su carrera como profesional del dise\u00f1o. Su meta es lanzar una colecci\u00f3n de ropa casual para damas y es por esto que requiere el apoyo de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n en la cual est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el que planea  invertir en materias primas e insumos para dar su primer paso hacia el mundo competitivo del dise\u00f1o y apostarle a su reconocimiento y posicionamiento en un mercado mucho mas estructurado. En la actualidad Magda tiene un taller, donde realiza todo el proceso productivo, desde la compra de materias primas, pasando por el dise\u00f1o, corte, preparaci\u00f3n, ensamble y acabado de piezas, hasta la comercializaci\u00f3n. Su principal mercado son los j\u00f3venes universitarios y ejecutivas de empresas que est\u00e1n convencidas de la calidad de los productos que Magda ofrece. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y sus compras de contado y su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para sacar su colecci\u00f3n y en por eso Magda trabaja de manera esmerada, diariamente desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde y de lunes a domingo; su capacidad de trabajo, disciplina y la calidad de lo que produce, son las fortalezas con las que le sale al paso, a una inmensa competencia en el mercado y por eso se sostiene. Esto es justamente el \u00e9xito de invertir un credikiva en su negocio, pues est\u00e1 en buenas manos. ","en":"For Magda the clothes making and high fashion business is the visible result of her creative expression as a design professional. Since she was 15 years old, she has been working very closely with seamstresses. A year ago, after being an employee, she decided to go off on her own to follow her dream of being a fashion designer. She used the money she had from terminating her work contract and from her career as a design professional. Her goal is to start a collection a casual clothing for women and that is why she needs support from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, the organization where she is applying for a Kiva loan. With it, she plans on investing in raw materials to take the first step towards the competitive world of design and gain recognition and position in a much more structured market. Right now, Magda has a workshop where she does the whole productive process, from buying raw materials to design, cutting, preparation, assembly and finishing the pieces, and then selling them. Her main market are young college students and business executives who are persuaded by the quality of the products that Magda offers. She sells on credit and pays for her purchases up front. Her biggest challenge is having enough working capital to make her collection, and that is why she works so hard. She works every day from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon from Monday through Sunday. Her work capacity, her discipline and the quality of work she produces are her strengths. She is getting ahead with a lot of competition in the market and that sustains her. That is the suxxess of investing a Kiva loan in her business; it will be in good hands.

province. She has two sons, both of whom are still dependent on her. The main source of her family's income is from cassava planting on one hectare of farmland, which she has been doing for several years to make a living. She can earn approximately 20,000 Cambodia Riels (KHR) per day and she manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after daily expenses. The low price of cassava output is the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Saven and one other member with VisionFund, while the other one is just starting with VisionFund. The past loan has helped Saven cater her family with sufficient foods. She is leading her group of three to apply for a loan. As the leader, Saven will use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to pay for labor costs. She hopes to increase her crop yields so as to earn more income to improve her family's standard of living and also build some savings for her children in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1154451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-30T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-29T14:10:05Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saven","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1026250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118658},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1026250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265724},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1026250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940975}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T19:35:50Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:06:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":455654,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James has been selling home products such as perfumes, utensils, and basins for the past 4 years.

Philippines. She has been running a mini-grocery store for more than two years now. This venture is the source of their income.\r\n\r\nBenvenida needs funds for her business to grow and expand. She is applying for a loan worth 12,000 PHP to buy additional merchandise to sell like canned goods, rice, bread and snack foods to sell to the people in their community.

But when he left the business in 1992, Terry realized he liked the business so much that he didn\u2019t want to give it up.

Shortly after, his wife developed his contracting business: Triple L Contracting. Terry then returned to FedEx delivering packages to homes and businesses in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. \r\n\r\nBesides the raise in pay he gains from contracting, Terry said he decided to become an entrepreneur because he enjoys interacting with his clients.

We know each other.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith his 13-member team, Terry says his business is growing; he plans on conducting interviews within the next two months. Triple L Contracting is expected to grow 47 percent in the next five years, he says, in which time he plans to hire four more drivers and purchase four more trucks. \r\n\r\nHowever, Terry has never had much luck with money, he says. As he knew he needed cash flow to fix his financial situation and keep his business running, Terry decided to obtain a loan. After hearing about Accion Texas Inc. from one of his employees, he inquired about one and was approved.\r\n\r\nThe loan helped Terry with operating expenses and payroll.  \u201cIt allowed me to take care of business,\u201d he says.

Specializing in commercial cleaning, including post-construction clean-up, window washing, power washing, and parking lot sweeping, Smacs is the parent company that has another two divisions consisting of office and residential cleaning in San Antonio, Texas. It is also certified by the Small Minority & Women-Owned Business Enterprise Program.\r\n\r\nThough they have a successful business now, the sisters struggled for many years.  Originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, the two came to Texas 23 years ago when their mother decided to remarry.  The original plan was to return to Mexico after obtaining American residency. But that didn\u2019t happen.  For 15 years, Lupita cleaned houses on her own and trained four women to start their own businesses.  (Three of the women are still in business.)  \r\n\r\nIn order to work more effectively with her American (and non-Spanish speaking) clients, she enrolled at San Antonio College to learn English.  When she mastered the language, she switched from doing residential cleaning to post-construction and other commercial clean-up. Together with her sister Silvia, who was the first in her family to graduate from college and has a BBA in business administration from The University of Texas at San Antonio, they created a mission and vision statement and reconstructed the business. \r\n\r\nWith their Accion Texas Inc. loan, the women plan to purchase two or three backpack-type vacuums to make work easier on employees. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be on their knees. It\u2019ll improve the quality of work and then service. It\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d Silvia said. \u201cWe tell our employees to always remember that we are not in the cleaning business, we\u2019re in the customer service business.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe Accion loan will help the women do more work in a shorter amount of time without compromising the service, Silvia said. Without help, it would have taken the women longer to purchase vacuums, or even begin to research pricing. Silvia said: \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful to Accion for giving us a loan. We hope it continues to provide this service to the small business community.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9325,"image":{"id":1154820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

During the weekends we teach our children this same art form that has been passed down through many generations. Our children are learning in school that they have opportunities to try other types of work as well, but we would not be surprised if they eventually decide to become rug makers, following the tradition of our ancestors. We are all involved in every aspect of weaving, from washing the raw wool when it arrives at shearing time, to carding it carefully and dyeing it in many beautiful shades before weaving begins. We are especially careful to choose the right colors for each rug \u2013 we put careful consideration into this artistic aspect of the rug-making process.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are very grateful for this help.

Jesucita is the mother of three children and makes her home here in a simple structure with her children and her long-term partner.<p>\r\n\r\nJesucita is excited to be taking out her ninth loan with Esperanza and at the opportunity to grow her business with capital at low interest. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, a little restaurant called Comedor where she prepares lunch for people in her community. Jesucita will purchase goods for cooking such as rice, beans, meat, and cooking oil, as well as disposables to serve at lunch. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to provide little by little for the needs of her family. She thanks all of you for your support.

His net profit is about 6,000 hryvnia.  Anatolyi needs additional money in the amount of 20,000 hryvnia in order to buy out the mini-bus Mercedes 208 Sprinter for subsequent work in the city.

She has a business there; offering internet and photocopy services, where she generates the income she needs to support her household.  She combines these businesses perfectly with selling a line of ladies\u2019 clothing.  Her business was born though the initiative of a friend, who taught her about communication technology and who sold her previous business after becoming very ill.  She used the money to buy and install computers and began offering this service after recovering her health.\r\n\r\nShe has her own personal daily sales goals that fit into her many desires to grow and increase her income.  During her 10 years of selling fabrics, she was able to build a customer base that she now wants to reestablish by making her customers a tempting offer related to women\u2019s clothing, by offering them credit so that they can make payments they can afford.  Her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to invest, so for this reason she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy computer accessories and in style women\u2019s clothing in quantity.  This investment will allow her to increase her credit sales and little by little she will be able to grow her business and her achieve goals of prosperity, which include seeing her children become prestigious professionals.

","en":"Lorena, age 26, lives in a municipality in the Bol\u00edvar department.  That is where she tends her small business selling school supplies and general stationery items.  She has eight years of experience in this business activity.  She worked in a stationery store, and five years ago she converted her knowledge of the market into her own entrepreneurial adventure.  It is located at her house.  Her sales are strictly for cash.  However, sometimes she takes credit.  She works from 6:00 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. on Monday through Sunday.\r\n\r\nHer painstaking effort is due to wanting to reach her goal of capitalizing her small business through savings.  She wants to do this in order to be able to prosper more each day.  Lorena travels to the city of Barranquilla where she buys merchandise to stock her business.  She does this to impact her customers, who are primarily young people between the ages of 12 and 25.  She sometimes sells to mothers.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy costume jewelry, variety items, women\u2019s clothes, and perfume.  She wants to add these items to what she sells, keeping in mind that there are a lot of people who request these items.  In turn, they are potential customers, and she has a good commercial place for her sales.\r\n\r\nHer goal for further on is to add communication technology services.  She wants to do this so that everyone in her town is able to access the networks, be up to date, and do their jobs, etc.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan will be successful because her investment is based on the market demand and the purchasing capacity from purchasing in cash.  This will allow her access to good offers from her providers, who also need to sell for cash.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1152629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy costume jewelry, variety items, women\u2019s clothes, and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-30T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-29T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153633},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":168651},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":172586},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176613},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":180734},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":197783}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.79,"local_amount":153633,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":157583.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775372},{"amount":96.37,"local_amount":168651,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172987.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387365},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":172586,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":177023.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994193},{"amount":100.92,"local_amount":176613,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":181154.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130549},{"amount":103.28,"local_amount":180734,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185381.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519417},{"amount":113.02,"local_amount":197783,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":202868.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071256}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T20:17:02Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":454889,"name":"Jose Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para realizar la compra de ganado de repasto, en esta ocasi\u00f3n comprara unos terneros que le permitir\u00e1 a futuro realizar una ganancia, ya que est\u00e1n peque\u00f1os y los crecer\u00e1.\nSu experiencia con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue positiva ya que le aument\u00f3 el hato ganadero, se ha mantenido comercializando con sus clientes y al mismo tiempo ha mejorado su situaci\u00f3n en la familia proveyendo mejores ingresos.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is seeking a new loan in order to buy livestock for his farm.

From her past experience, Chann is confident in applying for a new loan in the amount of USD 1,000. \r\n\r\nIn order to boost her crop productivity, $700 will be used for purchasing pipes for water pumping, fertilizer, and insecticides, while the remaining amount will be used to buy a sugarcane squeezing machine so she can earn additional income. \r\n\r\nShe expects to receive more crop yields so that she can make more profit to support her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1155891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, pipes for water pumping, insecticides, and a sugarcane squeezing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-30T22:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-29T22:50:11Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640968},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390695709},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450134615},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517698098}],"funded_date":"2012-07-31T03:31:30Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T18:14:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":456148,"name":"Ernest","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 48-year-old Ernest.

She has had a business selling food for 6 years. She is a native of the city of Leon.  She started her business selling soft drinks and other beverages, but over time she added the sale of food.  She was getting good results, but she noticed that she needed to stock up her business, since her goal was to expand it. She has a stall where she sells fermented milk, beverages and the types of food products that are sought after by her customers, who come from all over since Leon is a city with a lot of tourism.  She is requesting a loan to buy fruit, soft drinks, vegetables, rice, beans and meat, because these are ingredients that she uses to prepare her food.

It takes her three days to make a comforter cutting, sewing and pleating.  \r\n\r\nShe started out with one of her sisters learning to sew little by little and shortly thereafter her sister gave her a sewing machine and also helped her pay for a sewing course and that was when she was able to become independent.

Prior to starting this business she worked for a lady selling American clothes.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan was of great help to her because she was able to buy her sewing machines as well as to have raw materials on hand.

She has three children who are independent now; she lives only with her husband who is now retired.  \r\n\r\nShe relates that with this loan she\u2019ll be able to buy raw materials (assorted colors and styles of fabric) to satisfy the taste and preferences of her customers.

Santo Domingo is Ecuador\u2019s third largest city in population and it\u2019s located in a strategic spot for Ecuadorean commerce because it\u2019s in the center acting as a meeting point between the coast and the mountains.  Because of this, Santo Domingo is also a multicultural center where many cultures from both Ecuador and from outside the country meet and fuse.  In addition to commerce, animal husbandry and farming the various crops that grow there are strong sources of income.\r\n\r\nLuis is from this developing city.

For her entire household, she struggles growing paddy rice on one hectare of farmland.

She is happily married and has two kids that are her greatest motivation to move forward in life. She is a hard-working, enthusiastic and kind person. Unfortunately, and due to the need to work and pay for her expenses, she was not able to graduate from high school but her dream is to do that soon. Jenny dedicates her free time to play with her kids and at times she makes some delicious pallares con carne to share with her family.\r\nOn her own initiative, with a lot of effort and enthusiasm, Jenny started her own business, a grocery shop. Day in and day out, Jenny starts to work very early in the morning. She spends approximately 10 hours a day at her business. She is comfortable doing her job and thinks she does okay since her customers recommend her because of her good prices and kindness.\r\nJenny is very grateful to Kiva loaners because thanks to their help she will be able to build a fence around her house with appropriate materials such as brick and concrete. She will also be able to put on a corrugated roof.
