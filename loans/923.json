Es m\u00e1s, la ciudad abarca la mayor\u00eda del mercado ganadero del pa\u00eds. El clima es tropical h\u00famedo y tiene una temperatura que var\u00eda de los 18\u00b0C a 32\u00b0C. Santo Domingo es el hogar de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un grupo \u00e9tnico que existe desde antes de la \u00e9poca colonial. La ciudad es tambi\u00e9n conocida por su producci\u00f3n de frutas. \n\nEl grupo Virgen del Cisne est\u00e1 compuesto por 4 integrantes que basadas en una fuerte y buena relaci\u00f3n crearon un negocio de comercio de ropa, frutas, y comida preparada.

Por lo tanto, quiere que el grupo de Virgen del Cisne prospere y pueda incrementar sus ingresos. \n\nAunque las ganas no faltan, es complicado para las cuatro mujeres emprendedoras incrementar los ingresos del negocio por la falta de capital.

This city links the various Ecuadorian cities, making Santo Domingo a crucial point for Ecuadorian commerce.  What's more, the city handles most of the livestock trade in the country.  Its climate is humid and tropical; the temperature varies from 18 to 32 degrees centigrade.  Santo Domingo is home to the Ts\u00e1chilas, an ethnic group that existed from before the colonial era.  This city is also known for its production of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe group \"Virgen del Cisne\" is made up of 4 members who, based on a strong and good relationship, created their own businesses selling clothing, fruit and prepared meals.  Mayra, 26, only completed elementary school.  She has not yet started a family, because she wants to devote her energy to her business.  Maria Eugenia, 61, is also single, and she invests her time and experience in her business as a merchant.  Zoila Hercilia is 47 years old.  She is the single mother of a son who she has to support.  To do this, she works very hard to get ahead with her business.  Antonia de Jesus, 54, is also a single mother and has 2 children.  Even though she was not able to complete her high school education or go to college, Antonia dreams that her children will achieve this.

She is a midwife and supplements her family\u2019s income by selling medicines in the local area. Having been in this business for more than 20 years, she earns about 32,000 KHR per day to meet her family's needs.\r\n\r\nChanda\u2019s group consists of two members who have both been with VisionFund for five cycles.

For the past year, Rashidah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells milk and charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rashidah has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal to sell, and will help Rashidah to generate greater profits and buy more milk and a refrigerator. She hopes that in the future she will be able to enlarge her business. \r\n\r\nRashidah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

This is his story: I am a qualified accountant and entrepreneur who has lived in Tanzania for 17 years. I have a passion for starting businesses and act as an unpaid consultant for Umeme Popote. My Danish wife has worked in Tanzania for 12 years and together we run a life skills programme for young people (Training for Life). We have a calling to work with enthusiastic and exciting people and help them into business. I am also committed to seeing solar lighting as a key step to development here in Tanzania. The partners in Umeme Popote pictured from left to right in their new shop include, Felix (Manager), Clive, Kassim (Logistics, seated), Dotto (Technician) and Lydia (secretary\/sales assistant), and collectively they have experience of running business and of solar products prior to working with Watu na Nuru. The business runs from a small shop in Moshi and soon plans to acquire a vehicle to take product into villages both around Kilimanjaro and in Maasailand.\n\nUmeme Popote, which means \u201cLight Everywhere\u201d in Swahili, is the name of a retail business based in Moshi and supplied by Watu na Nuru \u2013 Solar (wholesale). The business was established in 2011 as a partnership for which I act as adviser. The aim of the business is to make high-quality, affordable solar lighting kits available to rural communities, especially those in Maasailand, where there is almost no grid electricity.\n\nUmeme Popote needs an injection of funds to ensure the right products are available at the best time of year (when farmers bring in their harvest), which is when people are ready to buy them. We are one of the retailers supplied by Watu na Nuru \u2013 Solar, benefitting from the partnership developed with Barefoot Power Australia, who make what we believe are the best micro-solar systems on the market. My greatest challenges are letting people know the benefits waiting for them with solar products as well as the money they can save by not using kerosene and by being able to charge their mobile phones. My favourite part of the job is seeing people's reaction to getting good, reliable light in their homes as opposed to smelly kerosene.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10025,"image":{"id":1147630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy stock of micro-solar lighting kits from Barefoot Power.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Moshi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-07-31T08:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-30T08:40:05Z","loan_amount":10025,"lender_count":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clive","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":15800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":10025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4800000},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3045.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6979.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3045.57,"local_amount":4800000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T08:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4802863.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381633360},{"amount":6979.43,"local_amount":11000000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T08:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":11006561.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467832453}],"funded_date":"2012-08-01T19:52:47Z","paid_date":"2014-04-18T08:56:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":456305,"name":"Everline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everline, aged 25, is from Kisumu and is married to Joseph: they have four children aged between two and 10 years.

is a 53-year-old single woman who has been raising cows for the past three years, benefiting from their milk to make tasty dairy products. She also prepares Mouneh (preserving foods that perish into foods with long shelf life which then last throughout a whole season) especially for the winter and autumn seasons.\r\n\r\nZeinab works hard during the summer to prepare the requested Mouneh. This is why she has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Al Majmoua. She will then be able to increase her supply of the necessary raw materials through buying the special vegetables and fruits that she preserves to meet her customers' needs. Zeinab feels very proud of herself when she delivers what her customers need and gets paid at the end. Through doing this, she proves to them how strong she is in the market and supports her stability and assures them of her presence.\r\n\r\nZeinab hopes to keep on expanding her business and hopes to open a Mouneh retail shop where she can display her various

Winnie is 21 years old, is single and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past four years, Winnie has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells sugar, beans, rice and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Winnie has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a refrigerator and will help Winnie to generate greater profits and buy a plot of land. She hopes that in the future she will be able to build her own house and buy a car. \r\n\r\nWinnie is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 17 years old, is single and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. For the past two years, Sandrah has been working hard to manage her salon where she styles and plaits hair. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sandrah has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a hairdryer and cosmetics, and will help Sandrah to generate greater profits and grow her business by acquiring assets. Sandrah hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and have a shop from which to sell spare parts. \r\n\r\nSandrah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past year, Teopista has been working hard to manage her farm which grows vegetables like cabbage and eggplant. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teopista has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more seeds for her farm, and will help Teopista to generate greater profits and allow her to finish her home. She hopes that in the future she will be able to buy another plot of land for farming. \r\n\r\nTeopista is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Through my tertiary education, I have wanted to grow a business and affect my world positively. I have worked with two banks previously in the retail, marketing and sales aspects and have developed great business skills such as direct marketing. I am where I am today because I have been opening my heart to new challenges and opportunities.\r\n\r\nMy business deals in the receiving and sending of money countrywide.  I feel it is a service that impacts positively in my city because it is accommodating to people from all walks of life. Anyone can walk into my shop and be comfortable to transact business with me. \r\n\r\nOn a daily basis, I have over three hundred people come to my shop to send and receive money. However, I only serve about a hundred and fifty of them. This is because I do not have enough working capital to satisfy them all. The situation worsens when it is the end of the month, as that is the time of the month when most people in Lusaka get paid. I tend to have even more people come to transact money transfers. It is for this reason that I am taking out a loan. This loan will have a very big impact on my business because I will be able to serve all my customers and this will stimulate my revenue.\r\n\r\nGetting this loan will also change my personal life. I will earn more profits and this will help me to finally move out of my parents' house and fulfill my responsibilities of helping out my family members. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":1154878,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2683,"youtubeId":"YRXCMJTfeH4","title":null,"thumbnailImageId":1154878},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To increase his working capital so that he does not have to send away half of his customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-07-31T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-30T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":24300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":24300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":540.05,"local_amount":2637813,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2640825.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533421},{"amount":383.41,"local_amount":1872750,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1874888.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132521},{"amount":344.45,"local_amount":1682437,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-26T09:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1684358.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281415},{"amount":3707.09,"local_amount":18107000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18127677.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657054}],"funded_date":"2012-08-13T23:13:13Z","paid_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":456503,"name":"Nomin-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nomin-Erdene, 34, sells women's clothes out of her rental stall.

She is also responsible for two of her grandsons.\r\n\r\nFor five years, she has been a storekeeper in a suburb where she sells sheets. She buys fabric that she transforms with the aim to make sheets. Her business runs quite well. Thanks to her experience in sewing she has been able to win a significant number of customers. However, the fact that she only sells sheets is a problem because her customers are asking for more and more other bedding items such as pillowcases and others. She is not able to meet their demand because her small working capital does not allow her to allocate a portion to the making of different bedding items. She cannot properly meet her customers\u2019 demand.\r\n\r\nShe would like this loan to buy large quantities of fabric that will help her to make other bedding items. This will allow her to meet her customers\u2019 demand and increase her profit. The profit will help her grow her business by buying more fabric in order to make more bedding items, but also to meet her family\u2019s needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1157009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase fabric.

Thank God, they say that it has been a very profitable business. Demand for meat, especially during this festive season of Ramadhan, has increased. She is therefore requesting a loan of 20,000 KES to purchase eight goats for slaughter in order to sell the meat.

been involved in an agricultural business in the Bekh village of the Syunik region for 25 years.  She keeps chickens, grows vegetables, fruits and nuts on her farm.  She sells her agricultural products, such as eggs, nuts, vegetables and fruits, in the city of Kapan.  Thanks to the profit from running the farm, Larisa has the ability to support her family.  Larisa is 56 years old.  She graduated from a financial-economics college and currently works, parallel to her agricultural business, as an accountant at a retirement fund.  Larisa is married and has three children: two daughters and a son.  Both of her daughters are married and live away from the parents, and the son is married as well, but lives together with his family and the parents.  Larisa's son works at a military base and also helps Larisa with the farm.  Larisa's husband works as a forest ranger at a forestry and also helps his wife with the farm during his free time.  Larisa has obtained loans from the Nor Horizon organization twice before and now needs a loan in the amount of $1,350 to purchase a horse and hay for it for the winter.  Larisa is certain that the horse is very necessary for her farm.  It would be possible to bring wood and the like from unreachable by car places with the help of a horse.\r\n

He is requesting a loan to pay for maintenance work on his vehicle (oil change, brake check, filter changes), because he needs to maintain his vehicle as it is the only source of work that he has to support his family.\r\n\r\nPablo's dream is to acquire a house through an \"anticretico\" (a type of lease arrangement), so that he can provide more comfort to his family and improve their quality of life.  This is the first time that he has taken a loan from IMPRO and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1154710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

The city sits among many farms where farmers grow maize, cotton and other crops.  Jeisson lives with his mother and his 2 younger siblings.  His earnings are the main source of income for the family because his mother earns very little.  Jeisson studied for a nursing degree before, but had to stop and go to work in order to support his family.

He is married and the father of two children, and he owns a small grocery store where he sells dry goods, Nintendo games, and he also has an internet cafe which is very useful.  In his community, very few people have internet, and so it's a great necessity and useful especially for the students in the area.  He says he started this business about 4 years ago, and before that he worked in transport, using a truck that his father gave him.\r\n\r\nHe says that the business, by being in his home, is greatly helped by his wife as well, and that he also rents out plastic tables and chairs.  Osman has taken loans from other institutions and now wants to work on this loan with Kiva through MiCr\u00e9dito.  He thinks he will invest the money in buying rice, sugar, oil, beans, fruit, plantains, vegetables, cleaning products, and kitchen staples, like sauces and spices.  This loan will help him to increase his sales, since he will have a greater number of products, and he will bring in more profits and have greater earnings.

He started at the bottom selling ice, because the city has a very hot climate, and there is a constant flow of customers in search of ice.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry for 12 years, having started this business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anara's hard work, today her business contains a dairy cow with offspring, one work horse and ten sheep, and the sales of milk yield about 2,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Anara requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock to send to a summer pasture.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued development of her business by building a

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business of selling food products two months ago with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Aida's persistence, she was able to increase her product turnover by earning a profit of 18,000 som (KGS).  Today the product selection is limited, and this is why Aida requested a loan in the amount of 55,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy vegetable oil, pasta and baked goods, beverages and ice-cream.

The house where they live is rented. She runs a store where she sells basic products. In the afternoon she sells pupusas (a thick, stuffed corn tortilla, a typical Salvadoran dish). She also tends a mill for corn flour, which she leases. From these three activities, she manages to obtain income to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan so that she can invest in the purchase of basic grains such as beans, rice, and sugar. She will also buy oil, cheese, and soft cheese. This purchase will allow her to stock her store and thus be able to serve her customers better. She will also be able to have the raw materials necessary to make pupusas. Her goal is to invest in her business to give it the necessary volume and better serve her customers. In the short term, she wants to be a good (loan) client and be punctual with her payments for this loan, since this way she will obtain opportunities for future

After several years learning by her side, Tata mastered the skill of selling. She then branched off on her own, to carry out the same activity as her mother. She has sold clothing and shoes for more than 10 years, and has an excellent reputation in the city of S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo increase her working capital so that she can make more profit, Tata started collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso 24 months ago. After successfully repaying two individual loans she has asked for a third, which she plans to use to buy 20 lengths of embroidered cloth and 25 pairs of shoes. She gets her supplies in Bamako and Burkina Faso.\r\n\r\n\r\nTata sells her goods to male and female customers on a cash and credit basis. With this loan, she hopes to make a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA. This will allow her to help her husband and take part in social events (baptism, marriage). Her ambition is to start trading internationally.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1127683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothes and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-08-01T07:01:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-31T07:01:36Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata Dite Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301503030},{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268657},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315499053},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102985},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243260},{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624846},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179734},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922522},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636159},{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029718},{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":27389.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819319}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T23:55:30Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":443369,"name":"Diakalia","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur  DIAKALIA est n\u00e9 t 1972 \u00e0 KATELE.

He has five children and lives in a nuclear family in Kadiolo (which is in the 3rd administrative region of Mali).\r\n \r\nDiakalia has been running a cereals business for six years. Through his experience in this area, he has built up a good reputation. He receives orders for many cereals, and corn in particular. He is therefore requesting this loan from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution to obtain the resources he needs in order to meet customer demand. \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow him to buy two tonnes of corn and one tonne of millet.
