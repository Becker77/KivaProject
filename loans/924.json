She plan to use this loan to buy 10 bags of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts, which will be made into soumbala, from the cereal warehouses in Koutiala. She will makes her sales in the town of Kayes to a retail customer base composed mostly of women, for cash and occasionally credit. She expects a monthly profit of 60 000 francs, with which she plans to repay the Soro Yiriwaso interest rates and support herself.

She comments that she had a grocery store before, with which she began her life as a businesswoman, but not having much experience she encountered various problems, one of which was extending a lot of credit to her customers. She thinks she didn't handle it well and so it went badly. Also the competition increased and so her sales went down, so she decided to close the shop and with the money she opened a stationery store. She has had the business for nine years and it's going better for her because there is no competition in her area. Added to all this, her son opened an Internet shop next door and so the two businesses complement one another. \r\n\r\nShe opens the stationery store every day Monday to Saturday. Her husband helps her staff the shop since he drives a truck and when he doesn't have a load he has free time.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCarmen oversees the operations of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, accessories, and also pay for the maintenance of her tricycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCarmen dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Two of her children are still in school. She has opened a bar near her home, in one of the capital city\u2019s districts, and has been managing it for 10 years already. Her business is going well thanks to the friendly welcome she offers to customers as well as to her long experience allowing her to attract a sizeable clientele. However, the substantial growth of her customer base prevents her from keeping up with the demand, given her limited capital, which is why the present loan is so important to her business at this moment. The loan will allow Catherine to add more cases of beverages, thus not only meeting demand but increasing her sales volume and her revenues. She will reinvest one part of the revenues in her business and use the rest to provide for everyday family needs.

She needs the loan to buy more of a variety of beauty products such as nail polish, eyeshadow, eyeliner and lip liner, and mascara, among other items. The loans she has obtained have helped her to have her own house, because she didn't have it before. One of her difficulties is that she sells door-to-door, and when she gets paid she has to walk around with cash. She has been robbed several times.

Also, he started the business when he found out that his wife was pregnant, and thanks to this business has managed to provide for his 14 month-old baby.  He started the business 2 years ago, and it has allowed him to have a good quality of life in his household and has given him good economic opportunities for progress.  But what is most important is that William has gained the recognition of people for his great charisma and the good service that he offers in his store.

sus hijos una buena calidad de vida, es por esto que debido a que los ingresos que generaba su esposo no estaban siendo suficientes para el sostenimiento de los gastos de su hogar, decidi\u00f3 abrir su propio negocio para as\u00ed tener otra fuente de ingresos para la familia. Fue as\u00ed como con unos ahorros y mucho esfuerzo mont\u00f3 un restaurante donde ofrece a sus clientes desayunos, almuerzos y comidas, y gracias a la buena atenci\u00f3n que ofrece ha logrado captar un gran n\u00famero de clientes. Desde que abri\u00f3 su restaurante las condiciones econ\u00f3micas de su familia han mejorado considerablemente, permiti\u00e9ndoles a sus hijos tener el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n de mejor calidad y tambi\u00e9n tener una mejor calidad de vida en toda su familia. Gracias a las ventas ahora puede generar 2 empleos y esto la hace sentir muy orgullosa, pues puede aportarle a 2 personas los ingresos que requieren para que sus familias tambi\u00e9n puedan salir adelante. Debido a que su negocio fue montado con muy bajo capital, no cuenta con tantas mesas y sillas como lo demandan sus clientes, por esto a la hora del almuerzo ha tenido que verse afectada por no poder atender m\u00e1s clientes por la poca capacidad que tiene en el restaurante; con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Mary Luz busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar sillas y mesas y as\u00ed poder aumentar la capacidad de su restaurante y ya no perderse de atender clientes por no tener donde ubicarlos.\n\nAs\u00ed espera que sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender a muchos clientes que antes no ten\u00eda capacidad de atender. Adem\u00e1s, los ingresos para su hogar aumentar\u00e1n considerablemente y su familia seguir\u00e1 gozando de una muy buena calidad de vida y hasta mejores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para pagarles una educaci\u00f3n universitaria a sus hijos. \n","en":"Mary Luz is a person who has always been known for wanting to give her husband and children a better quality of life.  The income her husband generates is not enough to support the household expenses.  That is why she decided to open her own business in order to have another source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nThat is how, with some savings and a lot of effort, she established a restaurant where she offers her customers breakfast, lunch, and other food.  Thanks to the good service that she offers, she has managed to win over a great number of customers.\r\n\r\nEver since she opened her restaurant her family\u2019s financial conditions have improved considerably.  This allows her children to have access to a better quality of education.  It also allows the whole family to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThanks to her sales she is now able to generate two jobs, and this makes her feel very proud.  She is able to contribute to the income of two people who need it for their families.  Also, they can get ahead.\r\n\r\nBecause the business was started with very little capital, she does not have enough table and chairs to meet the customer demand.  Therefore, her lunch business has been affected by not being able to tend to more customers.  This is because of the restaurant\u2019s small capacity.\r\n\r\nWith the thought of improving this situation, Mary Luz is looking for a loan to buy chairs and tables.  This way she will be able to increase her restaurant\u2019s capacity.  She will not lose customers because she does not have a place to seat them.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her sales will increase considerably this way.  She will be able to tend to a lot of customers that she previously did not have the capacity to serve.  Also, her household income will increase considerably.  Her family will continue enjoying a very good quality of life.  They will even have better financial opportunities to pay for their children\u2019s university education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1132820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She also helps her life partner cover their household expenses and her ten month old son\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nShe learned this business activity from her mother at a very early age.  Her mother devoted herself to this business activity, and thanks to this Alejandra managed to acquire great experience so that her customers receive very good work.\r\n\r\nWith some savings and great effort she managed to buy a machine with which she started to offer, from home, her sewing services to third parties. Thanks to the fact that it has been progressing little by little, she has been buying the machines needed to offer her customers good service.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that she does not have all of the machines needed to finish sewing the garments, she needs to pay a third party to do some sewing processes.  This reduces her profits considerably.   That is why she now looks to a loan to buy an overlock machine and an upholstery machine in order to be able to have the machinery she needs to be able complete the process of making the clothes.\r\n\r\nHer profits will increase considerably this way.  She will not have to pay high costs to another person to do the sewing process that she could not do in her shop due to lack of machinery.  Her biggest dream is to have a large sewing shop and to provide her ten month old son with a stable financial future and a good quality of

This business is his source of income and the source of income for his home, where he lives with his wife and their 2 children.  Thanks to this business, he has managed to get ahead in spite of the adversity he has faced, and he has also been able to provide his children with access to a good quality education.  \r\n\r\nSome time ago, when he started his business, he was offering a very small quantity of merchandise for sale and so his sales were sporadic as his customers did not have confidence in buying from his shop.  However, thanks to the good service he provides in his business, he has managed to make himself known to a lot of people and so has gradually made progress with his business.  One advantage that he has always had is that he is known to be a very friendly and generous person.  This has allowed him to get to know a lot of people in his town, and as a result the clientele of his business has increased a lot.  \r\n\r\nIn the coming months, one of his sons will start at the university, and since this brings considerable costs Manuel must increase his sales so that he will have enough money to pay the university fees.

Thanks to this, he has been able to overcome great adversities which life has presented to him. Previously, he worked in an arepa factory, and there he received a salary which was not sufficient to cover his household expenses. For this reason he decided to start growing fruit, and he started to improve his economic situation. However, this business went downhill when his crop became a total loss due to damages caused by winter floods. Thus he decided to return to the work of making arepas, but this time by starting his own business and also generating jobs. For the past 2 years, he has operated his own arepa factory, and his family's quality of life and economic conditions have improved considerably. In addition, he has been able to improve the quality of life of 4 people for whom he provides work in his factory. Since his business was set up with very little capital, he still has some needs so that he can carry out his production with better processes. For this reason he is seeking a loan which will allow him to buy a gas stove, two large pans and raw materials to improve his arepa production processes. \r\n\r\nIn this way, he will be able to satisfy all of the demand for his product, and thus he will have better income for his family. His greatest dream is to get ahead with his business and have better economic opportunities and a better quality of life in his home, in addition to generating employment for people who need it most.

","en":"Abduhamid is a good family man and entrepreneur.  He is married and raising three children.  Abduhamid has been involved in buying and selling livestock feed for four years.  He obtained his first loan in 2010 to increase goods turnover.  Since then, he expanded his merchandise selection with the help of that loan.  He previously only sold feed and dried grass for livestock and now added oil-cake.  He travels to the city and various regions for merchandise every time using his passenger car, but needs a large truck in order to deliver a large inventory of goods.  Abduhamid wants to use this loan to buy a \"Porter\" car and, thanks to the financial support, would be able to bring in more goods in one trip and make more

It was in this way that he got the idea of selling fruit on the street, and so with a small amount of savings he bought a bike with an attached cart and his first fruit.  Later, with a lot of effort, he expanded the business and started to sell a greater variety of products.  Now his family can have the support they need, thanks to this business.  Seeking better economic opportunities for his wife and child, Jose is requesting a loan to buy a glass case where he can exhibit other products, and also to do some maintenance work on his bike cart.  \r\n\r\nHis main difficulty has always been that he lacks capital for his business, but with this loan, he will be able to overcome this obstacle and make progress with his business.  This way he will be able to continue to generate the income he needs for his household and his family will be able to enjoy a better quality of life.

Since he comes from a family of limited economic means, he was obligated to find work so that he will be able to earn his own income and in this way hope to be able to save enough money to pay the university. \r\n\r\nThanks to the fact that he knows a lot of people, his neighbors, relatives and friends, Cristian\u2019s sales have been very good.
