Looking to overcome this difficulty, Beatriz is requesting a loan to buy personal products such as lotions, creams, and accessories in order to supply her business and to be able to meet large orders from her customers.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to help her two children get ahead in life by offering them a high quality education and, in the future, a university education.  Beatriz also dreams of having her own store where she can sell her products and thereby increase sales so that her household can enjoy better financial opportunities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1135078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy personal products such as lotions, creams, and accessories to stock her business and fill large orders from her customers.

The city has a mountainous terrain and a cold climate.  It is bathed by four rivers, and it is the third most financially important city in the country.  It was named a World Heritage Site in December of 1999.\r\n\r\nIts people are kind, gentle and warm-hearted.  They are hospitable people, like our members, and they still maintain the culture and traditions of their villages.  They work in different business activities, which allows them to improve their financial situations.  Their greatest virtue is that they never give up when facing life\u2019s adversities.\r\n\r\nYoni is one of the members of this group.  She is 32 years old and married.  They have two children, ages 12 and 7.  Her first child goes to middle school, and her daughter attends a city elementary school.  Her husband has private employment.  They do not have their own house, so they rent where they live.\r\n\r\nYoni has been selling clothes by catalog for nine months.  She conducts this business activity by going from place to place.  She also sells to her friends and acquaintances.  She sells her merchandise when the opportunity arises; therefore she does not have a schedule or days that she works.  She has also been working for one month cleaning a house, where she works three hours a day.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with her communal bank, which she was invited to join by a friend.  She will use the loan to buy clothes.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1137710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-08-02T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-01T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Icela Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoni Alexandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Esthela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":975,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391541},{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150440},{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383548},{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990552},{"amount":975,"local_amount":975,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126952}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T13:11:07Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:21:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":448725,"name":"Sokha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokha is 58 years old.

Her husband's occupation is farmer. The couple both work hard to be able to supply the basic needs of their family and support the studies of their one child who is studying. Estrelita's income goes immediately to their basic necessities, allowances of that child and some amount is used for maintenance of her rice field. \r\n\r\nWith her determination to gain more income and satisfy her customers' demand, she is asking for a loan amount of P40,000. She will use this loan in buying groceries so that she can economize her fare expenses in going to and from the market and re-stocking her store. In addition, she could save her time and effort. Estrelita believes that she could be a better entrepreneur someday.

He does this in the morning because in the afternoon he also home delivers large containers of bottled water which produces a bit of extra profit for him.  He\u2019s been in business more than 8 years but he used to do it with a three-wheeled cart until he bought his car which even though is a bit deteriorated is still very useful.\r\n\r\nThey hope to use this loan to buy fish, plantain and to repair their car.

Her husband works in agriculture.  \r\n\r\nLiliana started her business ten years ago.  She sells groceries in general.  She opens at 6am and closes at 9pm.  One of her disadvantages is that she has competition and she loses customers to it which is why she\u2019s asking for a loan to stock her grocery store in order to not lose any more customers.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy rice, soft-drinks, pasta, soap, flour, snacks, vegetable oil and vegetables, among other things.  With help from this loan she will be able to have her store better stocked and will generate more profits to continue supporting her children and helping her husband with household expenses.  \r\n\r\nLiliana\u2019s goal is to keep the store well-stocked to attract more customers.

She is married and has a 17 year old son that goes to shool, while her husband is a construction manager. \r\n\r\nLaura decided a year ago to start selling chickens after she originally started raising them for her personal consumption. Soon her relatives and neighbors asked if she she had any to sell, which ultimately led her to consider this as an option. Since then, she has been raising chickens of different sizes in several sheds. She does all the work on her own and sells chickens 2 or 3 days a week depending on how many orders she has. Laura admits that raising large quantities of these little animals entails a lot of care given that many die for various reasons because they are so delicate. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy chickens and pigs that she wants to raise, as well as vitamins and animal feed. She hopes that, in the future, she can have a bigger business to raise other animals.

In this way she was able to support her three children who are now 12, 15, and 18 years old. The main difficulty she has at home is that she's a single mother and the head of the household, due to which she has to generate all the household income, not having anyone's support. This comes on top of the fact that her children are at a school age and her expenses increase considerably.

The community celebrates the local traditions and festivals like the costume ball and the vaca loca [crazy cow], the castle fireworks, and more. Most of the residents farm or raise poultry, planting corn, beans, wheat, peas, and soy, and make rope. The people are friendly and kind and are very proud of keeping the local traditions alive.\r\n\r\nZoila Mar\u00eda, 52, is one of the bank's members. She is married, and 4 of her 5 children from the marriage are adults who work and offer her financial support. Her youngest son is 11 and attends a small public school. Her husband has been a construction worker since he was very young, and they own their home.\r\n\r\nZoila Mar\u00eda works very hard tilling her fields. Her harvests feed the family; if there is surplus food, she sells it. She also raises and sells guinea pigs, sheep, chicken, and cattle. She still makes rope so that she doesn't lose the skills that her parents taught her. She has been a member of the communal bank for 6 years, and she will use this new loan to buy sheep, chicken, and animal feed. Her goal is to own more animals.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1145823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep, chicken, and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-08-03T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-02T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda  Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":195.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":587.49,"local_amount":587.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":587.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391571},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150470},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383577},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990581},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":391.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":391.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126977},{"amount":195.87,"local_amount":195.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":195.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517559}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T19:16:17Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":457410,"name":"S\u00e8nad\u00e9 Julienne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 42 ans, S\u00e8nad\u00e9 Julienne vit avec son \u00e9poux et ses trois enfants qui sont tous scolaris\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole de la ville.

This rudimentary system obviously does not help her to identify the best products, keep sufficient inventory on the shelves or even know the profitability of the store. Ana Karen purchased Tiendatek because she wants to have more control over her business than a pen-and-paper system permits, having real-time information about prices, inventory and suppliers at her fingertips.

She began this business when she acquired a van two years ago and began selling fast food eight years ago. She sells chicken kabobs and pork sausage with banana chips in front of her home. She carries out this transportation service every day from 7:30 in the morning until 10 at night. On weekends she prepares food since it's when she sells more families generally go out on these days. As these businesses are separate they help her pay her expenses and enable her to provide financial security to her children. The loan that Dacia is requesting is to buy chicken and sausage to sell.
