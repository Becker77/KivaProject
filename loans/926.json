She lives in the city of Cuenca, which has a cold climate. There are many places to enjoy the countryside and nature. Since 1999 it has been a World Heritage Site. The people are friendly and gentle, and they still maintain the culture and traditions of their villages.\r\n\r\nCelia is 72 years old, is married, and has eleven adult children, six of whom are married and living independently; her five single children work to support themselves.  Her husband is retired and stays home.  They own their home, which is the fruit of their work together. She is very content since she is successfully recuperating from a fall that she suffered.  The other members of the family enjoy very good health.\r\n\r\nShe raises and sells animals, and she has been doing this for 30 years.  She also does other kinds of work, which allows her to improve her family's financial situation.  Having her own business has allowed her to stay close to her family.

She lives in the southern sector known as Isla Trinitaria that has unpaved roads which is a great problem; so is crime.  Despite this, she will continue in her business for a long time.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting is to buy notebooks, construction paper, pens, illustrated prints, etc. in order to have a wide variety of products to offer.

Her husband is Ruben and she is the mother of her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMargie maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMargie dreams of expanding her business and helping her child finish his studies through all her hard work in her business.

At first it was difficult for her to make her business successful and look after her first child. For this reason her mother, with whom she also lives, decided to help her with looking after her son. She has been able to obtain a well-located place were her products are in higher demand. She has situated herself in front of the university of her town. Her main customers are the young university students. Since her sales have improved, she is asking for a loan to buy more merchandise such as biscuits, sweets, snacks and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nYasvir has been a member of EDAPROSPO for just over a year, and is very grateful to KIVA and EDAPROSPO because they have supported her business and believed her word and in her dream which was to expand her business and give her children a good quality of life.

The work was tiring, but it paid very well whenever he had available jobs.  However, he also endured stretches of time without any work.  When he got married and acquired responsibilities, Pedro looked to find a business that could provide greater financial stability.  Therefore, he began selling natural products.  Pedro established this business with his wife and together they make a great team.  By making sales together, there is a lower risk that someone will rob them.  They have been in business for several years and have established customers who they visit.  Another strategy that they utilize for their business is to find a busy place where they can conduct demonstrations and offer samples in hopes of making direct sales.  Since his children are older, Pedro does not work according to an established schedule.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Pedro will buy products to sell and have money available for making presentations.  In the future, he wants to make improvements to his home so that he can provide his family a better quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1144180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural products to sell.

Most of the members already know one another.  They are responsible, enthusiastic, and most of all, punctual with their payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members is Juana.  She is married to Rafael, who works as a chauffeur.  Living only on her husband\u2019s income is not enough to meet the household needs, so Juana started a small business without much effort.  She raises chickens from her home and then sells them in the town squares and at the fairs near her home.  Juana is able to manage her business without neglecting her duties as a homemaker since she has two daughters who are in school.  Little by little, her business has grown since she has also started selling to large prestigious restaurants in her town.  Juana will use her loan to buy special balanced feed for her chickens, but she will also buy more birds.  Her dream is to have enough cash to build her own chicken coop that is large enough to house a great number of birds.  \r\n<p>\r\nJuana began working with EDAPROSPO more than two years ago.

The house she lives in is made of cement and has all the basic services such as water, light, a sewer system, and a paved road. \r\n\r\nShe works in customer service in the school's cafe, which is owned by her mother. Cristina started when the cafe was given to her to manage within the institution. Since she wanted to move forward, she went to college and earned a teaching degree so she could teach classes. Now she is an instructor and small businesswoman at the school. She works there from 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon. The products she sells at the cafe are jello for $.25, cookies for $.30, and potato chips for $.35. She works there alone because the school only has 180 students, so it is not beneficial to have an assistant because it would affect her profits at such a small cafe. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy a toaster, a blender, a small refrigerator, and merchandise so she can sell a variety of products. In the future, she is going to invest in a place where she will sell beauty products, since she also works in selling these products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1144153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Teodora belongs to the group Juventud y Desarrollo-Chupaca (Youth and Development-Chupaca).  This group has already been working with EDAPROSPO for more than a year.  It is made up of nine people, among them one man and the rest are women.  It is a very charismatic and supportive group among its members.  Teodora is a 41-year-old woman, married with two children, the oldest is 12 years old and the second child is only three years old.  She has been working in this business for more than six years.  Everything began because what her husband earned wasn\u2019t enough as her oldest child had to begin to study in a school and the expenses of those studies weren\u2019t able to be covered with the little amount that her husband earned.  This made Teodora start selling some vegetables that she planted in the garden of her own house and as her customers asked her for other vegetables she decided to implement in her business buying other vegetables that she couldn\u2019t cultivate.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan she will buy a large quantity of potatoes, onions, garlic and other vegetables so that her earnings will be better.  She dreams of a time when she has her own stall for her sales since she only sells her vegetables as a street seller in different markets and squares in her town.  Improving her income, Teodora is sure that she will be able to give to her children everything that she didn't have when she was young, since her parents were in a very humble condition.\r\n\r\nTeodora gives thanks to everyone who invests in all of the stories of hardworking people.  \r\n\r\nTeodora is dressed in a polo shirt and red apron and is the second person from the right in the second row.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1148951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy potatoes, garlic, onions, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venancia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Clara Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasmin Rossi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Agripino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301372449},{"amount":320.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":842.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131447},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":842.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367347},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":842.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976529},{"amount":320.84,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":842.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331113687}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T12:14:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":454146,"name":"Abdul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdul is age 33 and lives in Masindi, Uganda.

She is married to Rogelio, who works as a farmer. Together with her husband, Juditha manages her household while operating her business. She operates a food stall and works hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses.  In the Philippines, the working community and most of the families, eat home-cooked meals in the evening, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is both a family tradition and a matter of convenience and frugal living as it is considered a waste of money and time to cook food only for one or two persons since buying cooked rice and prepared food costs less than raw food. Juditha's regular customers are her neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in daily sales. \r\n\r\nJuditha is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan to buy more quantities of ingredients such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products.

Le gusta su actividad, porque puede contar con un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para apoyar con los gastos del hogar, adem\u00e1s de estar en casa para atender a su peque\u00f1o hijo. Por lo contrario, no le gusta cuando llueve muy seguido, pues le dificulta la venta, aunque eso no la desanima. \n\nEste es su tercer pr\u00e9stamo con la instituci\u00f3n MFP y est\u00e1 agradecida con el apoyo financiero para avanzar con su negocio, por lo que se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores. Y se siente a gusto con su grupo, pues los considera personas responsables y solidarias.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 1500 nuevos soles, invertir\u00e1 en la compra de los v\u00edveres e ingredientes necesarios para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas, buscar\u00e1 variar su carta incluyendo los nuevos platillos que le est\u00e1n pidiendo sus clientes.","en":"Jenny is 41 years old and is a hard-working and earnest woman.  She is resolute and cheerful as well.  She is separated from the father of her son Joseph, age 7. She lives in her mother's house, along with her mother, her three sisters, one brother-in-law, and her son.  \r\n\r\nShe sells typical foods from the region such as \"juanes\" (rice wrapped in leaves), and \"patarashca\" (fish wrapped in leaves).  These are very popular dishes for consumption since they are traditional foods from the area, but she also prepares various foods. For this reason, every afternoon she sets up a table at the front of her house where she kindly serves her customers, most of whom are neighbors. She has been doing this work for 2 years, managing to grow her clientele, and up until now doing it alone.  She likes her work because it provides income to assist with household expenses, in addition to allowing her to be at home to care for her young son. On the other hand, she does not like it when it rains very often, because it makes sales very slow, but that doesn't discourage her.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the MFP institution and she is grateful for the financial support that helps her to advance her business.  Thus, she agrees to comply with the payment of their fees, as with the previous loans. She also feels comfortable with her group, since she considers the other members responsible and caring people.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested, of 1500 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency), she will invest in the purchase of supplies and ingredients needed to prepare her meals.  She will seek to vary her menu, including adding new dishes that her customers are requesting.

","en":"Ruben, 52, is an honest man who is very hardworking and is full of dreams.  His partner of 20 years is Emma, and together they have 4 children aged 17, 13, 5 and 4.  They live in the house that he built, thanks to all of the effort that he put into his work, with the sole aim of providing their children with better living conditions.  \r\n\r\nRuben has a business providing passenger transportation services.  He has a moto-car (light, 3-wheeled passenger vehicle) that he bought 4 years ago.  Ever since he has been working, trying to give the best of himself to please his customers and earn their trust from the moment they start their trip until they arrive at their destination.  In addition to this, he also works as a security guard at night in one of the main markets in the city.  He has been doing this work for 7 years, and although he acknowledges that at first he had trouble adapting to a daily routine, he learned to manage his time with hours of rest and a fixed work schedule.  Ever since the time he started doing these activities he has worked alone, and he is always on the lookout for new opportunities.  For this reason, he now wants to set up another business in his house selling beer and soft drinks, because in his neighborhood no one has chosen this type of business.  He hopes to do this very soon, and to continue to exert himself in everything he does for the good of his family.\r\n\r\nThis is his 12th loan with the MFP institution.  In his communal bank, he has always been known for being a very responsible person who is punctual with his payments, and he is sure that this time will be no exception.  He is very content and pleased with the support that he is being provided with to multiply his investment, and he is very committed to his communal bank and hopes to continue to work with them. \r\n\r\nWith the sum of 1,000 Peruvian soles that he requests he will purchase a new awning for his moto-car, and with the sum that remains he will purchase beer and soft drinks to start his new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1149090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to change the awning on his moto-car, and also to buy soft drinks and beer to start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":153.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":159},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":158.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":177.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":181.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.92,"local_amount":312.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":328.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456447},{"amount":63.36,"local_amount":158.4,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":166.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452108},{"amount":68.33,"local_amount":170.84,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":179.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447281},{"amount":70.89,"local_amount":177.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":186.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053182},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":181.26,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":190.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188116}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T00:13:07Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":453619,"name":"Alexandra Lucrecia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alexandra vive en el sector sur conocido como Isla Trinitaria, ella vive en una casa de su propiedad con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos.

On this occasion you will learn more about the \u201cUnidas por Siempre\u201d (Together Forever) communal bank that has nine women who work in retail.  Because of a variety of circumstances, they had to find ways of earning their own income by means of their businesses so that their homes would not lack income.\n \nSuch is the case of Jane, 31.  She's married and has one minor child.  She started out working in a factory selling furniture which made it possible for her to save money in order to start a business of her own where every day she sells bread rolls, gelatin treats, snacks, etc. outside a school.  This business has allowed her to support her son\u2019s schooling and also to make improvements to her dwelling.\n \nWith this current loan she will buy supplies for her business like bread rolls, gelatin treats, potatoes, etc. in order to prepare her dishes.  Later on, she plans to open a grocery store to generate higher income.  \n \nThe \u201cUnidas por Siempre\u201d group thanks those who made this loan possible.  Jane appears in the rear.  She\u2019s first on the left and is wearing a black sweater."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1150698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread, gelatin, and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jane Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanina Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthya Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margot Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isela Dorita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yovanna Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanina Katty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1716.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1716.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1716.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1716.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1716.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1716.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1308.34,"local_amount":3433.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3438.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301372451},{"amount":654.16,"local_amount":1716.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131449},{"amount":654.17,"local_amount":1716.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367349},{"amount":654.17,"local_amount":1716.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976531},{"amount":654.16,"local_amount":1716.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331113689}],"funded_date":"2012-08-25T20:13:27Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:54:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":454548,"name":"Jihad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jihad is a father of six children and lives in Wehdat, which is in the east part of Amman.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Nardalisa earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Nardalisa is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNardalisa dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Editha earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Editha is requesting a loan of  PHP 15,000. She will utilize the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She began her business with very little merchandise and later, with what she had gained by working, she bought more.  That is how her business grew, bit by bit.\r\n\r\nShe is the mother of three children who are studying, so she is the sole worker in her business.  Recently, she has been able to locate herself in the front part of her house, where she has a bulletin board and places the fruit in boxes where she sells them and thus she is able to maintain them without ruining any.\r\n\r\nShe decided upon this type of business because of the rapid sales, since fruits and vegetables have a short time in which they are good and they go bad very quickly.  Also this business doesn't give the option of credit.  At her place of business, she sells onions, peppers, potatoes, sweet corm, all different fruits in season, and she works from 7 in the morning until 8 at night, though her day begins at 5am because she has to go out and buy her products first.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan in order to invest in her business and to buy the fruits and vegetables that are being offered.  In the future, she hopes to supply a better location that would allow her more time off and where she would be able to offer better

Her life partner, Eleuterio, works in civil construction, and he is the father of their 13 year old son.  They live together in the house they built on land that they bought through a lot of effort over the years.\r\n\r\nShe sells piped water to her neighbors.  She has a well that is 80 meters deep from which she gets clean and pure water.  Initially she drilled the well for her own use.  However, seeing the need and the requests from her neighbors, she decided to install pipes to get the water to their homes.\r\n\r\nThen, more people were approaching her and requesting this service.   Her business is growing, and she needs greater capacity in her tank and the submersible pump in order to extract the water.  She started over 15 years ago with her own capital.  So far her husband supports her by taking care of the maintenance of the network of pipes and by cleaning the water tank.   She is now more at ease financially.  She has plans to improve her well\u2019s infrastructure and pipes in order to service more people.\r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She hopes to continue on with her objectives.

Working as a paid laborer in the neighbor country will offer him a higher payment than what he does in his own country. With regard to this, Khoem decided to ask for a loan from lenders in order to help her husband. She wants to obtain a loan in the amount of KHR 1,500,000 to supplement her savings to pay for document charges and his passport.

They live in the house that they have been caring for for 3 years, having it in their custody for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nHe works as a motorcycle taxi driver. His work consists of transporting passengers to their destination as rapidly and safely as possible. Everyone that uses his service ends up very happy and grateful for the friendly treatment he offers and because he charges a fair price for his work, without adding inflated charges. He has been doing this work for 5 years and he likes it a lot, although he says that at first it was hard work because he had to face the negative comments of some people and because he did not know the city completely. Now he does his work in the best way and his earnings have increased. He hopes some day to buy a car in order to be able to continue achieving his goals.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan through MFP and he is very happy knowing that he will have financial help in order to expand his working capital. At the same time, he promises, once again, to complete his payments punctually as he has done with previous loans. And he feels satisfied belonging to his communal bank, as everyone is very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, 1000 soles, he will refurbish his motocycle changing the awning and upholstery, and also buying some spare parts to improve performance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1151561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to change the awning and upholstery of his three-wheeler and also to buy spare parts for repair jobs\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":176.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.02,"local_amount":307.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":324.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456473},{"amount":65.33,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452136},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":169.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447309},{"amount":70.47,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053209},{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":183.11,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":193.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188142}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T21:59:04Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":454663,"name":"Yosra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yosra is a very committed woman with lots of ambitions.

","en":"Fredy is 39 years old and is a man eager to get ahead. He enjoys working for the good of his six children, whom he has had during his 16 year common law marriage with his partner, Elvira. He lives on family land, where his siblings and their families also live, each in his\/her own house.\r\n\r\nFredy is very skilled at work and performs many jobs, but he mainly dedicates himself to the sale of juices he makes with tropical fruit. Everyday he goes to the city\u2019s main market to obtain the freshest fruits to make the juices that he then sells at a stall he has near his house. He has had this business for around 15 years and works at it every morning. He feels that his business is profitable because he generates a good income, thanks to the customers he has succeeded in attracting over the years. In addition, he sells fruits on the sidewalk in front of his house during the afternoons and there his partner helps him wait on customers. He has also had this business for 15 years, without any problem. As if that were not enough, he also works as a \u201cmototaxista\u201d (a driver of a three-wheeler van taxi) throughout the streets of the city. He has his own vehicle, which he uses not also as a means of transportation, but also as a source of work. He has been a taxi driver for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHis wish for the future is to establish a more comfortable and larger juice bar.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan from MFP and he is grateful to all those who have made it possible. He assures that he will continue being punctual in his payments, as he was with previous loans. With the sum requested, S\/. 1,000, he will buy sacks of fruit, mainly oranges and passion fruit and other ingredients such as \u201calgarrobina\u201d (black carob tree syrup), honey and bags of \u201ccancha dulce\u201d (sweet roasted corn kernels) in order to continue selling his delicious juices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1151553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fruits and other ingredients that he uses to make his juices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":176.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.02,"local_amount":307.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":324.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456471},{"amount":65.33,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452134},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":169.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447307},{"amount":70.47,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053207},{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":183.11,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":193.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188140}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T15:24:02Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":454958,"name":"Sincerlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Sincerlita, 51, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

In the future he hopes to be able to expand his house and make his stockroom larger.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1151591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy gas cylinders ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Washington","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.25,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":85.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":88.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":92.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":97.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.58},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.67,"local_amount":72.18,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":73.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340469},{"amount":80.89,"local_amount":79.25,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":80.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096851},{"amount":168.05,"local_amount":164.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331207},{"amount":87.12,"local_amount":85.36,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":87.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072270},{"amount":179.14,"local_amount":175.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":179.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318625},{"amount":93.72,"local_amount":91.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":93.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013370},{"amount":0.22,"local_amount":0.22,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":0.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453732},{"amount":94.92,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":94.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459577},{"amount":297.27,"local_amount":291.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":297.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087902}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T17:30:50Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":454959,"name":"Rous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rous is 39 years old and married to Phal, aged 41.

She is married to Emelito, her business partner, and father to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEdna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Edna earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Edna is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEdna dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Por lo contrario, lo que no le agrada es cuando llueve demasiado y dificulta el tr\u00e1nsito, pero no se desanima, por tanto tiene planes continuar y concluir con el acabado de las paredes y el piso de su local para dar una mejor comodidad de sus comensales.\n\nEste es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 8 que tiene con la instituci\u00f3n MFP.

","en":"Emerita is 59 years old. She is a hardworking and tenacious. She is separated from the father of her 11 children, most of whom are independent. Now she lives alone with her three daughters and two of her grandchildren, in the house she bought with hard effort.\r\n\r\nHer activity is the sale of meals (breakfasts and lunches). To do this she has outfitted a space in her housing, where she sets up, every day, tables and chairs on behalf of her customers, and in addition she gives pension (contracting of meals) to the workers from the neighborhood businesses. She has been in this business for more than 8 years and with the help of her daughters she attends to her clients. She likes what she does, and has become known in her area for the good service and her dedication to work. On the other hand, what she doesn\u2019t like is when it rains too much and makes the going difficult, but it doesn\u2019t discourage her, therefore she has plans to continue and to finalize finishing the walls and the floor of her facility in order to provide more comfort to her dining guests.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan that she has through the MFP institution. She comments that she feels good about the communal bank, because she likes the work that they do helping people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 3,000 soles, she will invest in the purchase of the necessary ingredients in order to prepare her meals, such as rice, sugar, oils and more.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1149123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy the ingredients to prepare her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":327.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":322.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":359.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":373.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":371.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":401.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.56,"local_amount":327.56,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":329.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456450},{"amount":123.63,"local_amount":322.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":324.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452111},{"amount":137.96,"local_amount":359.91,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":362.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447284},{"amount":143.11,"local_amount":373.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":375.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053185},{"amount":142.56,"local_amount":371.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188119},{"amount":153.77,"local_amount":401.13,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":403.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572029},{"amount":159.5,"local_amount":416.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":418.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121838},{"amount":163.91,"local_amount":427.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867743}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T19:57:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":454675,"name":"Yosra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yosra is a very smart and active business owner who lives in Wihdat with her sons.

She has four children with her partner of 24 years, Carlos, and her youngest child is only 5.  The child needs all the  protection, attention and care that can only be offered by the parents.  They all live in the house that her partner built, thanks to his effort and with the earnings from their respective jobs.\r\n\r\nFelicita wakes up very early every day to be at her small grocery store.  Her customers are principally her neighbors and they come to her store to buy all the necessary items to make their daily meals, such as bread, sugar, rice, bananas, vegetables, etc.  Her business is in her own house and it\u2019s the only grocery store in the neighborhood.  That is why her sales are so good and her earnings are always profitable and satisfactory.  She started 2 years ago and her husband helps her.  Before, she sold bottled water but that didn\u2019t work well and so she decided to set up the store that she has.  Besides that it\u2019s going well, she feels that it isn\u2019t enough so to her business  she added selling prepared food every night from outside her house.  Luckily this is also going well but the intense rains have resulted in the situation where sometimes she can\u2019t sell enough.  That is why she wants to build a small stand so she can set up a restaurant in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is loan number 14 with MFP.  She has always been characterized in her group as a responsible person and she is happy because of the opportunity offered her to make a good investment.

Viven en su casa propia donde hasta ahora \u00e9l sigue esforz\u00e1ndose, pues desea brindarle una mejor calidad de vida a su familia.\n\nA diario se dirige a los aserraderos ubicados en los alrededores de la ciudad para conseguir madera de buena calidad y de los precios m\u00e1s bajos para ponerlos a la venta en el mismo lugar donde los compra. Tiene clientes que siempre solicitan su mercader\u00eda y cuando no tiene no duda en acudir a otro lugar para conseguir lo que le pide su cliente. Lleva en este negocio desde hace 2 a\u00f1os y todo le est\u00e1 marchando de maravilla. Cumple con esta funci\u00f3n todos los d\u00edas, por lo general en las ma\u00f1anas, de lunes a viernes, mientras que los fines de semana ayuda a su c\u00f3nyuge en la compra y venta de granos y productos alimenticios; para eso se va al puerto de la ciudad a partir de las 4 de la madrugada donde compra directamente a los agricultores que llegan de las chacras. Sus productos preferidos son el arroz, la yuca, el ma\u00edz porque le generan mejores ganancias. Espera seguir trabajando de esta manera y m\u00e1s adelante establecer un peque\u00f1o reaserradero propio.\n\nEste es su pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 10 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP, por lo que est\u00e1 muy entusiasmado de contar nuevamente con un apoyo crediticio para seguir laborando y poner aumentar su capital de trabajo. Es consciente que para seguir creciendo necesita seguir siendo responsable como lo fue hasta ahora y est\u00e1 muy convencido de pagar sus cuotas a tiempo.\nCon el monto solicitado, 3800 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de madera, especialmente de la que se usa en las construcci\u00f3n de viviendas. Tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1 granos y productos alimenticios (yuca, arroz y ma\u00edz) para contribuir en el negocio que tiene junto a su pareja.","en":"Julio, 45, and his partner, Ruth, have 3 children: Carol, 15, Shesira, 3 and Abel, 5. They own their house. Julio continues to work hard in order to offer his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEvery day, he goes to the sawmills located outside the city to buy good quality wood at low prices and then sells it in the location he happens to be in at the time. He has clients who solicit his merchandise and if he doesn\u2019t have it, he has no problem going elsewhere to find what his clients need. He\u2019s been in this line of business for 2 years and it\u2019s working out wonderfully. He works every day, generally in the mornings, from Monday to Friday, while on the weekends he helps his partner buy and sell grains and food products; to do this, he gets to the city\u2019s port by 4am where he buys directly from farmers who come directly from their farms. His preferred products are rice, manioc and corn because they generate better income. He hopes to continue working this way and in the future establish a small sawmill of his own.\r\n\r\nThis is his 10th loan with the MFP; he\u2019s very keen to count on this financial support again, so he can continue working and increase his business capital. He\u2019s very aware that he has to continue being as responsible as he is now in order for his business to continue growing. He\u2019s very committed to making his payments on time. With the loan of 3800 new soles ($1450US) he\u2019ll buy more wood, especially the kind used in building houses. He\u2019ll also buy grain and food products (manioc, rice and corn) to contribute to the business he has with his partner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1151650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"buy and sell more wood and buy manioc, rice and corn for his other business.

She lives in a small village in the Akhalkalaki District with her family: her 33-year-old son, daughter-in-law, and mother, who is a pensioner. The family runs an agricultural business; they have a plot of land where they grow potatoes. They work hard on their plot during the spring and summer seasons to reap a good harvest. They sell their harvest on the local open market.\n\nFilomina requested a loan to expand her agricultural business. The loan will enable her to cultivate the family-owned land and sow more potato there. With the borrowed amount Filomina will purchase seeds of potatoes and fertilizers for land.

He has made a living in agriculture since he was 10 years old. His father was the one who taught him, and he always instilled in him that he should work. Later, when Julio got married, with more reason he had to fight on behalf of his family. \r\n\r\nApart from agriculture, his father also taught him bricklaying, how to repair shoes, and how to make horse saddles. Julio is grateful to his father for having taught him so much; due to the circumstances of his life, he has had to do everything. Owing to the fact that his dream is that his children graduate from the university, in order for them not to experience what he has lived, even though Julio expresses pride of all that his father taught him; but like all fathers, he wishes something better for his children.\r\n\r\nHe gets up at 4:30 a.m. in order to carry out some activities in his home, and then he goes to the place where he works and returns to his house at 5 p.m. In order to complete his work, he buys some of the needed materials in the town and sometimes he has to travel to the bigger city to bring materials to repair shoes and saddles. In order to get to the town, he has to walk ten minutes, and then he boards a bus that takes an hour, but if he goes to the bigger city, the bus ride is an hour and a half. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 17 sacks of fertilizer and a bag of seeds, and to pay for the labor. The crops need the final fertilizing and to sow corn there he hopes to obtain greater income.

Trash is not actively sorted in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage piles and trash bags searching for recyclable materials such as metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. These materials are sold to junk shops for a small profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories, and others similar places. Jerry's regular customers are his neighbors and local community members and he earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales daily. \r\n\r\nJerry is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan buy trash from collectors to help him continue to operate his business. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. Jerry fervently hopes that his children will be able to have a good future through all his hard work. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. Groups gather weekly to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1154197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for recycled materials for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-08-05T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-04T13:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6000.03,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6315.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356308},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2806.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114406},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350453}],"funded_date":"2012-08-05T16:34:04Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":455420,"name":"Kong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kong, a 32-year-old resident of Siem Reap province, has three children, all currently attending school and in need of daily allowances.

It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Amparo earns a profit by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them retail. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in daily sales. \r\n\r\nAmparo is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income with her loan. Amparo hopes to grow her business and dreams of improving her family's future with all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The Group Barrio Pincha-Chupaca, a group that now is initiating its fourth cycle, is characterized by its solidarity and hard workers. One of its members is Ms. Crecenciana, who is 54 years old, married with children who are older and a granddaughter. She began her business selling beer occasionally in the traditional festivals in her town. At the beginning she sold a little, but with the passing of time and seeing that her earnings were good, she pulled together a little capital to be able to sell more and grow her business.
