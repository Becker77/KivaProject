We present the Group \"Vallecito's Progress\" which is made up of 5 women entrepreneurs engaged in various commercial activities, the majority of which live in the surrounding area.  This group is going on its 4th loan cycle and has shown responsibility in its previous loans. \r\n\r\nOne of the members is Ana, 36, whose family consists of her partner and 4 children. Ana has made her living selling groceries for over five years which she sells from a market in her neighbourhood.  It was not easy for her to get her business ahead because she had financial problems, but with perseverance and hard work she was able to come through.  Later, she would like to have a small grocery store in her home so that she can be close to her children. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy merchandise such as rice, sugar, milk, etc. for her stall. Ana is pictured second from the left dressed in a red sweater and red pants.  The Group \"Vallecito's Progress\" is grateful for the assistance from the Kiva loans because it has made their progress possible. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1153031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, milk, and noodles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Melva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardina Gladiz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donatilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1218.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301372463},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":609.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131461},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":609.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367361}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T03:32:55Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Gonzalez","image":1094319}},{"id":454930,"name":"Duo Rosas De San Juan Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DUO ROSAS DE SAN JUAN\nEste D\u00fao Est\u00e1 integrado  por do\u00f1a Magdalena de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de una ni\u00f1a de 7 a\u00f1os de edad,  do\u00f1a Magdalena quien se dedica a la venta de art\u00edculos de  consumo diario desde  hace 8 a\u00f1os, como ma\u00edz, arroz, az\u00facar, cereales, aceite, gaseosas etc. Atendiendo a su clientela todos los d\u00edas desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche,  tambi\u00e9n  vende los fines de semana  refacciones como tostadas, atol, panes, manjares,  gelatinas, helados, y refrescos, nos cuenta que gracias a Dios sus ventas son buenas, ahora ella est\u00e1 solicitando este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda en productos comestibles de primera necesidad.\n","en":"DUO ROSAS DE SAN JUAN\r\n\r\nThis duo is comprised of 29 year-old Magdalena who is married and a mother of a 7 year-old girl.

Since they were small he taught them everything related to this crop. \r\n\r\nDuring harvesting is when there is more work to do. Jacinto contracts laborers to help him because his children are not enough. The coffee that he grows is organic so he does not use chemical products on his land. During the last harvest he was able to product four tons and has made a very high goal that within the next three years he wants to be able to produce ten tons. In order to reach this goal, hard work is not enough. He also needs to buy coffee plants, fertilizer and do a lot of preparation work for the land. For this reason he needs a loan.\r\n\r\nIn addition to growing coffee, he is also planting trees on his land which help him by giving shade to his plants. He also sells the wood to have an additional income. In total he has 300 trees planted.

When she got married to Jose Luis she continued this work because he is also a coffee producer. Maria Antonia doesn't find it hard to meet the demands of her work in the home and the field. She and her husband have two young children who help them to work in the field, since for them coffee is the family business. The coffee that Maria Antonia produces is conventional but she would like to change to organic coffee production. This process will take a minimum of three years because she has to make changes to some of her plants and wait for them to begin to produce. She also needs advice from the Union Regional de Huatusco so that the process will be done in the best way possible. In order to get started, she needs a loan so that she can restore part of her farm and plant seedlings, as well as preparing the land and weeding. In five years or so, she hopes to be producing a total of 10 tons which will improve her income considerably and give her family a better lifestyle. She and her husband would like to be able to send their kids to study in the university so that they can have better opportunities in the future.

caf\u00e9. Comenz\u00f3 con su padre que fue quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 todo lo relacionado con este cultivo y cuando se cas\u00f3 con Mar\u00eda se independiz\u00f3 pues su padre le regal\u00f3 un terreno para pudiera trabajarlo y sacar adelante a su nueva familia. Actualmente Alfonso produce un promedio de 6.5 toneladas anuales las cuales entrega a la \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d para que sea procesado y exportado. En los trabajos del campo lo ayuda el menor de sus 3 hijos que tiene 15 a\u00f1os y aun es soltero, adem\u00e1s contrata personal para que lo ayude cuando la carga de trabajo es mucha. Para la siguiente cosecha Alfonso necesita renovar algunas de sus plantas as\u00ed como abonar y para eso necesita de un cr\u00e9dito. Alfonso actualmente tiene un total de 3000 plantas de caf\u00e9 y espera que al final de esta cosecha pueda tener unas 4000 para as\u00ed aumentar su producci\u00f3n y sus ingresos. Adem\u00e1s de dedicarse al caf\u00e9 Alfonso va por temporadas a trabajar a la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico como alba\u00f1il ya que hay temporadas en las que no hay mucho trabajo que hacer en las fincas y aprovecha para realizar esta actividad. Una de las mayores satisfacciones que Alfonso tiene es haberle podido brindar a sus dos hijos mayores la oportunidad de estudiar una carrera universitaria y ya solo falta que el menor de sus hijos vaya tambi\u00e9n a la universidad.","en":"Alfonso, 60, has been growing coffee since he was an adolescent.  He began with his father who taught him everything related to this crop; and when he married Mar\u00eda he established himself independently since his father gave him land to work on to provide for his new family.  Currently, Alfonso produces an average of 6.5 tons a year, which he delivers to the \"Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\" for processing and export.  \r\n\r\nOn the plantation he is helped by the youngest of his three chidren, a 15-year-old son who is still single, and he also hires workers to help when there is a lot of work.  For the upcoming crop season Alfonso needs to renew some of the plants and buy fertilizer, and this is why he needs the loan.\r\n\r\nAlfonso currently has 3,000 coffee plants and hopes to reach 4,000 in order to increase production and income.  In addition to growing coffee, Alfonso does seasonal work in Mexico City as a bricklayer, since there are times when there is not much to do on the plantation and he takes advantage of this to do something else.  One of Alfonso's greatest satisfactions is having given his two older children the opportunity to get a university degree, and now it is only his youngest who has yet to go the university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1153914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"To buy coffee plants and fertilizer for his farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15304.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810646}],"funded_date":"2012-08-13T03:36:34Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":455348,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"To buy fertilizer for his plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":27000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1906.62,"local_amount":25739.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":25937.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936708},{"amount":93.38,"local_amount":1260.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810647}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T18:22:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":458087,"name":"Dom\u00e9to","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Couturi\u00e8re et revendeuse de produits de mercerie, Mme Dom\u00e9to est m\u00e8re  de 03 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s.

They work with their two children, sharing the different tasks that need to be carried out on their plantation. As well as working the land, Luz Mar\u00eda is also responsible for running their home. The family lives in an area which doesn\u2019t have certain basic services, so if anyone falls ill they have to travel to the next town where there is a clinic. \r\n\r\nIn spite of these difficulties, the family has managed to get ahead. During the most recent harvest their total production was 8 tons, which they passed on to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d for processing and exportation. For the next harvest they need to carry out various jobs on the plantation such as sowing new crops, fertilising, cleaning and preparing the ground. Luz Mar\u00eda needs a loan to be able to do this. \r\n\r\nThe family also bought a new plot of land recently, which they would like to use for growing more coffee. As well as coffee, they also grow sugar cane to increase their income. \r\n\r\nLuz Mar\u00eda has told us that they own their own house and would like to make some improvements to it. It has a tin roof, which they would like to replace with concrete to make the house more secure and comfortable. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1153926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy coffee plants and fertiliser for her plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T08:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T08:50:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":434.35,"local_amount":5791.37,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5908.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936709},{"amount":15.65,"local_amount":208.63,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":212.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810648}],"funded_date":"2012-08-06T16:15:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Toal","image":null}},{"id":458091,"name":"Hontongnon Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"HONTONGNON est un groupe de huit personnes, dont les membres r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

Sometimes Domingo also works for other people so that he can increase his family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nDuring the most recent harvest Domingo\u2019s plantation yielded 10 tons. To maintain this level of production he needs to buy coffee plants and fertiliser for the next harvest. He needs a loan to be able to do this. Domingo also intends to buy a new plot of land within the next year. If everything goes according to plan, he hopes to increase production to 13 tons within 3 years, which will increase his family\u2019s income.

This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and will enable Rasim to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1155941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To paint and purchase a new engine for his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T11:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T11:00:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Nethery","image":268367}},{"id":456221,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benita is 47 years old from Tinago, Dauis, Bohol.

Through doing this, Sath can earn a suitable income each harvesting season. \r\n\r\nSath's husband helps her in this type of business and also offers a transportation service to people in his neighborhood. Recently, his transportation business has been suffering because of his old motorcycle. It often breaks down while he is operating his service. \r\n\r\nWith regard to this, Sath decided to borrow some funds from Kiva lenders in the amount of KHR 3,200,000 to purchase a new motorcycle for her husband's transportation service. Sath believes that the loan will bring financial stability for her family. Sath wants to provide her children good opportunities for education as she strives to work

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Shno is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has two years' experience with the little sewing and tailoring business and she would like to improve both her work conditions and the services she can offer to her customers. She would like to renew her work area and buy an overlock machine. To be able to do the work and make the purchase, she took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

He lives in a house that he owns, one he was only able to build after much hard work.  His hope, he says, is to provide a better life for his partner and three children.\r\n\r\nCarlos operates a taxi business.  He managed to buy his taxi after many years of scrimping and saving.  He couldn't afford a new vehicle so he bought a used one and fixed it up.  He sometimes carries passengers who contract with him for several hours work at a time, work that supplements the normal taxi services that he provides most days.  He has operated the business for 12 years, the first six of which he could only afford a rented vehicle.

She and her partner, Marcos, a carpenter, have five children, 21-, 18-, 14-, 10- and 8-years old, respectively.

She works from morning to early afternoon.  She has operated the business for a little more than a year, a business she started because she needed the money.  Her oldest daughter has helped her with the business from the beginning, waiting on customers and taking care of the kitchen.  Constantina expanded the business several months ago, adding sales of basic grains--rice, maize, beans--to supplement her food stall income.  The extra business has also been a success and now she hopes to open a restaurant.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second MFP loan.

She separated from the father of her children after many years together and now lives with her children, 23-, 21- and 12-years old, respectively, in a house that she bought with her ex-partner.\r\n\r\nJacinta operates a meat sales business.  She has a food stand that she sets up in her front yard where she can meet her customers.  She buys live chickens from her brother's farm, chickens that her brother sells to her at a discounted rate.  The business is the only one of its kind in the neighborhood and has steadily grown as more and more of her neighbors have come to buy her chickens.  She has operated the business for 7 years and spends much of her day tending it.  She relies on her children who often help her with everything from buying and preparing the chickens to selling them.  For the future, she wants to build on the business by opening a grocery.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 4th MFP loan.  She says that she is grateful for your help and confidence because the loan will help her meet her goals.  She says, too, that she is committed to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time and that she is happy with her community bank because she considers its members to be responsible and supportive.\r\nJacinta will use part of this 2500 new soles loan to buy more chickens for her meat business and the rest to buy merchandise (rice, sugar, milk, eggs, cooking oil, bread, flour, soft drinks, snacks, fruits, vegetables) to start a grocery business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1154121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

What he likes about this is that he\u2019s learned through experience how the plants behave according to weather conditions and this gives him much satisfaction.  He also likes to be able to generate profits for his home through his grocery sales.  Prior to starting these businesses he worked for others and his profits were small; this was one of the motivating factors that pushed him to become independent and now he does much better and feels he\u2019s on the right path towards progress.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #17 and he\u2019s very grateful to know that he\u2019ll have financial support and commits once again to make his installment payments punctually like he\u2019s done in previous loans.

She\u2019s single but has a little boy who is the result of her relationship with her ex-spouse.  She lives in her own house with her parents, siblings and her son.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling traditional regional food and other daily consumption dishes.  Her work day starts very early with the purchase of ingredients needed for food preparation.  She sells all day from breakfast to lunch and some evening dishes.  Her food stand is located on the path alongside her house and she\u2019s always in constant activity.  She\u2019s been in business 7 years and her mother and sister help her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it produces income she can use to help her family cover household expenses and above all because it allows her to provide her son with everything he needs.  She\u2019s had many economic needs for a long time because of the lack of employment or because of businesses that produced neither much satisfaction nor peace of mind.  But now she feels more at ease because she has an occupation she\u2019s passionate about and that has helped her quite a bit.  She now plans to rent a locale and enlarge her business so that she can tend to customer with more comfort.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan.  She thanks all the people who make her loan possible in order to continue working towards making her plans a reality.  She commits to being a punctual member and to make her installment payments responsibly.  She affirms that she feels at ease with and grateful to her loan officer for all the training and advice she\u2019s gotten to start on this new path.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 700 new soles to buy ingredients and supplies like rice, oil, condiments, sugar, spices, vegetables and tubers to prepare her dishes; she spends about 150 soles per day.  She will also buy some utensils in order to provide better customer service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1154261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":120.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":122.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":128.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.01,"local_amount":106.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":110.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456509},{"amount":41.74,"local_amount":106.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":109.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452170},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":115.83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":119.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447346},{"amount":47.21,"local_amount":120.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053246},{"amount":48.02,"local_amount":122.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":126.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188179},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":128.59,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":133.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572070}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T03:36:25Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":456977,"name":"Dick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dick is 49 years old and lives in the Philippines.

On her part, Betty has a small grocery store at home where she sells basic staple items like groceries and foodstuffs.\n\nWhen work in the fields requires less attention, Mois\u00e9s provides transportation services between his area and the city and vice versa and to do so he bought a used car.  His future plans are clear: they want to acquire a house in Lima in order to live with together with their children.\n\nHe belongs to the \u201cNueva Esperanza-Huaricolca\u201d (New Hope-Huaricolca) communal bank and this is his MFP loan #7.  He is very happy because thanks to the educational chats he learns new things and can foresee better living conditions.\n\nMois\u00e9s will use the money from this loan to buy 15 sacks of fertilizer (120 soles each) for his potato crop that\u2019s been planted since June.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1148057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for his potato crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3534.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576718}],"funded_date":"2012-09-02T18:27:17Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":450057,"name":"Deysi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Deysi es soltera y tiene dos hijos que estudian en la universidad, viven en una casa en anticr\u00e9tico, la misma ubicada en la zona Challapampa de la ciudad de La Paz.\nActualmente trabaja como profesora  de ciencias naturales en el magisterio por m\u00e1s de ocho horas al d\u00eda ya que ayuda en los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n y pago de servicios b\u00e1sicos de su familia, es por eso que solicita el cr\u00e9dito para ayudar a su hija a pagar su tesis en la carrera de geolog\u00eda ya que su hija a\u00fan no trabaja.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Deysi, es que sus hijos sean profesionales y obtengan buenos ingresos para mejorar su calidad de vida.\nEs la primera vez que solicita el cr\u00e9dito junto a IMPRO y KIVA.\n","en":"Deysi is single and has two children who are studying.

Para cumplir con su trabajo instala todos los d\u00edas un \u201ccarrito sanguchero\u201d en la puerta de su casa donde fr\u00ede las papas, el pollo y otros insumos que caracterizan este platillo. Adem\u00e1s acondiciona una par de mesas y sillas donde atiende a sus ocasionales clientes. Su trabajo se inicia desde muy temprano con la compra de los ingredientes necesarios, por las tardes va preparando todo en su casa y pone en marcha su trabajo de venta a partir de las 5 de la tarde. Por fortuna su vivienda est\u00e1 ubicada en una esquina muy concurrida, en la calle principal del centro poblado en el que vive. Lleva en este negocio cerca de 2 a\u00f1os y recibe la ayuda de sus hijos mayores. El \u00fanico problema que encuentra es que tiene que instalar y desinstalar, todos los d\u00edas, su puesto de ventas, es por eso que viendo las ganancias que le genera su trabajo y contando con el apoyo de su pareja, tiene planes de alquilar un local donde tendr\u00eda todo fijo y listo para brindar la mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes.\n\nEste es su cuarto pr\u00e9stamo con la instituci\u00f3n MFP y agradece a las personas que hacen posible su acceso al cr\u00e9dito. Se compromete a pagar de manera puntual todas sus cuotas, como lo hizo en los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores.

Su inversi\u00f3n diaria puede variar de 100 a 150 soles.","en":"\r\nLidia, 36, is a hardworking, determined woman who very much wants to get ahead.  She has lived with Francisco who works as a day laborer for many years and they have five children who are 19, 18, 9, 7 and 4 years of age.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling fast-food like \u201csalchipapa\u201d (fried sausage with fried potatoes), hamburgers and others.  To do her work she sets up her food cart every day at her doorstep where she fries potatoes, chicken and other ingredients characteristic of this dish.  She also sets up a pair of tables and chairs where she tends to her walk-in customers.\r\n\r\nHer work starts very early shopping for necessary ingredients and in the afternoon she prepares everything at home and the selling starts at 5pm.  \r\nFortunately, her house is located on a very busy corner on her town\u2019s main street.  She\u2019s been in business two years and her older children help her.  \r\nThe only problem is having to set up and take down the stand every day which is why noting that her work is generating profits and with support from her spouse she\u2019s planning on renting a locale where she can have everything set up permanently and ready to provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth MFP loan and she thanks the people who make it possible for her to access credit.  She commits to making all her installment payments punctually like she did with previous loans.

She has lived together for many years with the man who has been her companion since her adolescence and with whom she has two daughters named Mirella and Keysi.  They all live together in a humble house she built with her spouse as a result of their efforts at work.\r\n\r\nShe sells beer and soft-drinks.  She places her order every Monday with suppliers she works with and places the bottles in a refrigerator she has at home.  She\u2019s been in this business for about five years and does very well since she earns good profits from her sales.  She works with help from her spouse and a brother.  She recalls that when she started this business she was very fearful because she did not know how to control her customers who drank more than what\u2019s permitted but with time she learned how to face this situation and started to encourage responsible drinking and this has been very useful for her.  She gradually learned how to consolidate her work and now she\u2019s a great seller and has many customers.  She plans later on to become a wholesale beverage supplier.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan.

He sells from place to place along the city streets going house to house or to see regular customers he\u2019s managed to win over though the years.  He\u2019s been in this business more than 20 years and sometimes his spouse helps him.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his work is being able to alternate one type of product for another and not fall into a routine.  He\u2019s aware that certain merchandise is better received than others so he doesn\u2019t concentrate on selling just one type of thing and is constantly varying his merchandise.  Profits from this work have allowed him to cover basic household expenses and he feels very useful and happy.\r\n\r\nThis is his first MFP loan so he\u2019s very grateful to people who make this loan possible.  He also feels very good working in his communal bank because he knows most of the members and he considers them to be good people.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 800 new soles to buy cleaning supplies like detergent, lye, bath accessories, sponges and others to sell this season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1154269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cleaning supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nivardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":132.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":137.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":139.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":146.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.67,"local_amount":122.27,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":130.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456512},{"amount":49.35,"local_amount":121.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":130.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452173},{"amount":53.81,"local_amount":132.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":141.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447349},{"amount":55.81,"local_amount":137.39,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":147.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053249},{"amount":56.79,"local_amount":139.79,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188182},{"amount":59.57,"local_amount":146.63,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":156.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572073}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T16:29:10Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":456299,"name":"Abdalla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdalla commonly known as 'J' in the neiborhood is 28 years old and lives with his wife and their baby.

Victoria takes care of the domestic work and, in addition, helps her husband to work on the farms, principally during the harvest, which is when there is more work. They have a son who is already married and a daughter that still lives with them and also helps them with the work in the field. The coffee that they produce is conventional, but they are already undertaking the tasks necessary to convert little by little to the production of organic coffee, and they hope that by the next harvest part of their production will be organic. They are undertaking this process thanks to the support of the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d, an organization in which Victoria has been a member for several years already. For the next harvest, she will need to sow new coffee plants and fertilizer her fields. This is why she is requesting a loan. In a few months, they will start bearing fruit.  Some parts of Victoria\u2019s farm have deteriorated due to the passage of time, and they have planned to re-sow them in order to maximally take advantage of their land. Victoria and her husband\u2019s personal plans are to repair their house and to send their daughter to university to study so that she will have better employment opportunities in the future.

Actualmente vive solo en una humilde casa que ha podido edificar con el resultado de su esfuerzo.\nSu negocio es la venta de frutas. Su labor empieza con la compra, al por mayor, de frutas regionales, principalmente naranjas y sand\u00eda; luego las pela y las coloca en envases, al natural o en jugos. Lo hace ambulatoriamente y tambi\u00e9n se coloca en un establecimiento fijo. Viene realizando este negocio desde hace 15 a\u00f1os y siempre le ha ido muy bien.

He has six adult children and currently lives alone in a humble home that he was able to build though his efforts.\r\n\r\nHis business is selling fruit.  His work begins with him buying regional fruits in quantity, mainly oranges and watermelons.  He then peals the fruit and packages it up as fruit or juice.  He does this on foot and also sets up in a shop.  He has been doing this for 15 years and things have always gone well for him.  He has been able to consolidate his wide customer base and this shows because he sells out every day.  What he likes most about his work is that he is able to do other things in his home and use his spare time to do other jobs such as carpentry or masonry.  What he doesn\u2019t like is that at times he must go to the market early in the morning to be able to buy his products.  He expects to continue working so that he can continue saving up so that he can have a peaceful old age in a business where he can work from home.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 18th loan through MFP and he appreciates those who make possible for him to continue with his objectives.

He spends his days driving his taxi and it doesn't matter whether it's daytime or nighttime- he works with energy and always carries a smile to give to his occasional passengers. Due to having these qualities he is always requested to fulfill this function. He's been doing this work for four years and owns his own car. He was able to buy it from a friend who was going to throw it away. He knows the city's streets very well and always provides fast service. At the beginning things were complicated for him since it was difficult to have to drive for so many hours and he was not getting used to the routine. But, when he began to see this job as profitable, he had to adapt to the working rhythm and fortunately managed to do so. In the future he would like to buy another taxi and rent it out in order to improve his earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP. Therefore he is grateful for the opportunity and trust that they are putting in him to receive this loan. On the other hand, he has committed to fulfilling his payments responsibly and punctually. Moreover, it pleases him to be part of the communal bank to which he belongs as he has seen that its members are supportive and very punctual people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested sum (S\/. 1000) he will hire the service of a good mechanic to refurbish his car and leave it in optimal condition."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to hire the service of a mechanic to refurbish his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456520},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452181},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":173.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447357},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053257},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":186.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188190},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572081}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T21:56:28Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":455890,"name":"Silverio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silverio tiene 53 a\u00f1os, es un hombre amable y muy trabajador.

He and his spouse have four children and now two grandchildren live with them; they are his main reason to work and strive daily.\r\n\r\nHe grows oil producing palm trees and other regional products.  He owns a field where he\u2019s been working for 20 years that has provided the necessary stability to be able to educate his children and to give them the opportunity of having better living conditions.  \r\n\r\nAll of his products are in high demand.  He sells the fruit from the palm trees to an industrial firm located near his field while the regional products are sold in the city\u2019s wholesale market.  \r\n\r\nWhen he started this work his difficulty was incomplete knowledge of agricultural techniques but with time he gained experience and improved production.  He\u2019s doing very well since he sells his entire harvest thus generating good household income.  He\u2019s now getting ready to start a new project: he intends to open a grocery store at home that his spouse will run.\r\n\r\nThis is his first MFP loan so he\u2019s grateful to all those who make his loan possible so that he can continue towards his objectives.  On the other hand, he\u2019s quite committed to make his installment payments very responsibly and he\u2019s happy to be part of his communal bank because all the members are good, kind and mutually supportive.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1000 soles to buy lumber, nails and metal needed to build his store\u2019s locale.  The other part of the money will be used to buy basic staple items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to build his store's location and to buy stock merchandise for it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silverio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456521},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452182},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":173.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447358},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053258},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":186.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188191},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572082}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T12:58:08Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":457049,"name":"Sokly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokly, age 45, is a garment worker.

During the day he clears, cares for and fumigates so that noxious weeds won\u2019t interfere with proper growth.  He\u2019s been working in this business for 15 years and does very well thanks to the quality of the product he offers for sale.  In general he works alone.  However, during planting and harvesting he has to contract help from workers to help him complete the amount required from buyers. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his work is that he always has time available to not neglect his activities at home.  He does well and sells his products to a processing plant that produces the palm oil.  Like all entrepreneurs, Toribio wants to have another business which is a fish farm that will help him increase his income.

He leaves for his fields very early, where he inspects his plants\u2019 growth and tries to keep his cultivated area well weeded. He has been engaged in this work for the past 20 years and it has allowed him to be economically viable as well as providing him the opportunity to support his children for many of their expenses.  He works alone, however occasionally his sons help him which enables him to save money that he could eventually use to contract a labor force. He owns a van that he uses to transport his entire crop to the place where he sells it. \r\n\r\nJuvencio complements this business by working as a laborer constructing residential buildings. In addition, he also works as a wood operator when the opportunity presents itself. What he likes about his main line of work is that it provides him the necessary time to engage in other activities. His farming is going well because, similar to other agriculturalists in the sector who work with the oil palm, he sells his products at a good price to a palm oil business that is located a few kilometers from his farm. He hopes to be able to maintain the same work rhythm that he has had up to now and to continue moving forward.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he is grateful for the opportunity and confidence shown in him. He is committed to making his payments on time and as well he likes being part of the communal bank he belongs to because he has seen that its members are responsible and supportive people. With the sum requested (S\/. 1,000), he will purchase spare parts and the necessary replacements to refurbish his van, because he urgently needs to make repairs so that it will run properly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase the spare parts and necessary replacements to repair his van.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-07T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-06T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456515},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452176},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":173.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447352},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053252},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":186.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188185},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572076}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T11:15:13Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":457067,"name":"Tabitha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabitha is 32 years old and married, with three children.

Her children help her to develop her commercial activities so that she can generate the income she needs to improve their living conditions.  Maria decided to separate from her life partner in 2004 due to his alcoholism, as it was a bad example for her children and because he wouldn't allow her to work in sales.  She argued that from the time that she was very small she has been carrying out work in retail trade; when she was living with her parents she used to sell seasonal fruits from their house.  She was always very satisfied when she could sell all the products she had brought to sell. \r\n\r\nNow Maria has a small store that she started up at the end of November in 2007.  She has a cart, or trailer, that she has set up to sell hot-dogs and hamburgers, and she does this work every day from 5:30pm until 9pm in front of her house.  She also has a bicycle set up to sell tacos, and she uses this to sell at a school that is located a kilometer from her house from Mondays through Fridays from 9 to 10am.  She buys all of the products that she sells in her store, including those that she uses to make fast food, from shopping centers in the city located 5 kilometers from her house.  She transports these products using public transportation.  \r\n\r\nMaria is requesting a loan to build a shed and to put cement on the floor so that she can start a business selling tortillas and pay off a loan that she has from another institution.  With this investment, she will set up her sales post to start a new business (selling tortillas) and will make an improvement to the roof in the place where she sells to her hot-dog and hamburger customers.  In addition, she will pay off another loan, which will allow her to improve her financial situation.   Among her goals are: expanding her business, teaching her children how to run the business, and creating sufficient capital to invest in the purchase of a big house for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1154911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He lives in Ivirgarzama and currently works at a road maintenance company, AMVI in Valle Sacta. He has helped his parents farm since he was a child. He lives alone and has no children. He studied business administration at Mayor de San Sim\u00f3n University. \r\n\r\nHe always stayed apart from farming, because he intended to return to work on his mother's parcel of land. Two years ago, he suffered a traffic accident and fractured part of his lumbar bone. Now he is recovering, but feels well enough enough to work in the fields.
