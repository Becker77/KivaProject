This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I have always loved handicrafts. When I was 17, I started my own ceramic workshop, but I changed direction and began to work in wrought iron and blown glass. I experimented with sheets of iron to give my works more movement. We cut the metal sheets, hammer them into shape and weld them before treating to retard rust. Every piece created at my workshop goes hand in hand with originality, design and quality. We are always developing new designs and products.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you you for your interest in assisting us artisans, for our only desire is to work and provide for our families in a dignified manner.

She is married and has 3 children with 2 of them currently in school. For the past 4 years, Jauahara has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities like dry beans, sugar, and maize flour. \n\nTo help expand her business, Jauahara has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like maize flour, dry beans, and sugar for resale, and will help Jauahara to generate greater profits and save her profits and add some to the business capital. Jauahara hopes that in the future she will be able to own a boutique. \n\nJauahara is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Gorret is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Gorret has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food like \"matooke\" (green bananas). \n\nTo help expand her business, Gorret has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food for resale, and will help Gorret to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Gorret hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \n\nGorret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is single and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Hajarah has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells charcoal. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hajarah has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal for resale, and will help Hajarah to generate greater profits and pay for the rent where she has the business. Hajarah hopes that in the future she will be able to own a clothing business. \n\nHajarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Hajarah's future prospects by helping her own a big retail shop in town.

For the past three years, Sylvia has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells honey from bees. \n\nTo help expand her business, Sylvia has requested a loan of 600000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more honey for resale, and will help Sylvia to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Sylvia hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \n\nSylvia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past two years, Cissy has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food, charcoal, and tomatoes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Cissy has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh foods and tomatoes for resale and will help Cissy to generate greater profits and pay rent for the business. Cissy hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \n\nCissy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

For the past two years, Justine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities like dry beans, sugar, and maize flour. \n\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like maize flour, dry beans and sugar for resale. This will help Justine to generate greater profits and pay rent were she has the business. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to start a chicken business. \n\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Hasifa is 18 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past year, Hasifa has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells chicken. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hasifa has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicken feed and more chicken birds for resale. It will also help Hasifa to generate greater profits and save her money so as to buy domestic animals in the future for resale. Hasifa hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \n\nHasifa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

For the past 2 years, Moreen has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells flour, sodas, beans, and bread, etc. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Moreen has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stock like beans and rice to sell, and will help Moreen to generate greater profits and improve her standards of living. Moreen hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another shop. \r\n\r\nMoreen is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Together with her partner she has three children ages 18, 15, and the last is two months old. They live together in the home they built through years of hard work, effort, and savings.\r\n\r\nShe works selling groceries and basic necessities. Every day, starting very early, she opens the doors of her store to attend to her customers who come all the way to her store with the confidence that there they will find what they need. Her shop is the most well stocked in her neighborhood, and her clients never hesitate to buy from her, not only for that reason but also because of the quality of the brands that she offers and her cordial and friendly service. She remembers that when she started out in this business she did not have a lot of products to offer and so could not make good sales during the day; however, she sought a solution, saved up a little capital, and gradually was able to put together her small store. Now sales are going very well for her. She has been in this business for two years and always has the help of her spouse. What she enjoys most about her work is conversing with her customers and watching them start the day with a smile. The most difficult thing about her work is getting up early to open the shop and balancing this with the care of her young baby, though when she feels tired she knows that this is her work and that it has to get done.

She is a mother of six children. She manages her own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRemedios runs a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Remedios earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Remedios is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRemedios hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

She works with the support of her children, who help her in all of the agricultural activities. She likes this business, because she has seen that it is quite profitable, since the product she sells has a good price on the market. Seeing the good results that she has now, she is planning to supplement her business by constructing a fish farm (to raise fish) or a pig farm and in this way continue to generate more income. \r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, therefore she is grateful to those that make this loan possible and provide the necessary support that can make her plans come true.

2002 raising animals with savings amounting to 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tenacity and perseverance, today her farm consists of two dairy cows, seven sheep, four heifers, and 13 goats. Her monthly income is about 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of dairy and milk products. Gulmairam also works eight acres of irrigated land and 16 acres of non-irrigated clover and wheat. For the processing of grain, her husband built a small mill that brings in about 7,000 som (KGS) in the seasonal months. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Gulmairam approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 102,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional heads of cattle -- calves. In the future, Gulmairam wants to increase her farm and expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1158408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Korgon village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-08-07T20:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-06T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulmairam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":102000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":34000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":34000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":34000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":34168.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862904},{"amount":725,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":34168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426660},{"amount":723.35,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34168.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.65,"payment_id":517462636}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T06:14:25Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:23:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":457363,"name":"Marites","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marites is 39 years old, married and has two children.

She previously took out a 20,000 PHP loan from CCT that she used to buy a variety of grocery items and products needed to stock her shop. Her profits were a big help in paying for her child\u2019s school fees and personal, household and business expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nOlivia would like to apply for another 25,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. Her philosophy: the more items displayed in the store, the better, which leads to better profits.

It has 6 members and it is directed by a board presided by Fermina. The businesses that the members of the communal association carry out are varied: sale of pork rinds, knitting alpaca and vicuna wool blankets, sewing skirts, sale of fried potato chips, sale and delivery of jewels. The loan they will get will help small micro-entrepreneurs, including Fermina. Fermina tells that this is the first time she is a member of Pro Mujer, and she entered thanks to the invitation from a promoter of the institution that went over to her house to invite her. Currently she knits alpaca and vicuna wool blankets. She learned about this business from her mother a long time ago, since she helped her with the knitting. With time, she decided to start her own business. The loan she will take now is to buy supplies (buy wool at wholesale) from factories and will later on produce it and sell it at wholesale. This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is single and has 3 children. When she is asked about what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health area and the savings. In the picture Alejandra is not present because she had a doctor's appointment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1156407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She began her business because she wanted to raise income to support her children. She works at the business every day from 7:00 am to 7:30 p.m. She says that the main challenge to her business is that some of the goods spoil along the way before taken to the market.\r\n\r\nMabel requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, coconut oil and peppers.

He has been a rice farmer for eight years. He has requested a Kiva loan to use to meet labor costs. He plans to use the profits to pay his children's school fees and to pay for medical insurance.\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37 per cent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 per cent of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90 per cent of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This work is the sole source of income for his family.  Uysyf previously worked in the Russian Federation.  Because his wife ran the household by herself and was involved in raising their five children, he decided to return to his homeland and bought a car with the money he earned in Russia in order to help his wife run the household and raise the children.  This is Uysyf's third loan.  He obtained his previous two loan to make small repairs to his car.  Uysyf wants to use this loan to install gas equipment because gasoline cost rose a lot, and this upgrade would decrease his expenses.  Uysyf expresses his gratitude to our organization for the financial

old, married and has five children.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1983 with an initial sum of 8,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and ten sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS).  Meiyskul also works on 2.8 hectares of land, where she grows Bulgarian peppers and beans.

lives in the Mariakani area of Coast Province, Kenya. He is married, has two children and has earned a living for the last three years by running a retail shop where he sells spare parts for motorbikes. He started the business using his personal savings. Tsuma learned about Milango through friends who invited him to the group so he could access credit to improve his business operations. His main challenges are price fluctuations, inflation and the  high cost of fuel and transport. He is applying for a loan for 62,650 Kenyan shillings to buy spare parts that are not now available in his shop. His will use the extra income made possible by the loan to increase his savings. His plan for the future is to open more spare-parts shops in other areas.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1158660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare
