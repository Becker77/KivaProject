is one of our associates from El Seybo, a rural town whose economy depends on agriculture. She has been running a small cafeteria and a beauty salon for about five years after starting the business with her savings. This is her second loan. Her business has been improving and expanding with more clients and products. She will invest this loan in her beauty salon by purchasing cosmetics, hair and beauty products. She sells the products to her clients and neighbors, especially women.\r\n\r\nBelkis lives with her two children and her husband in their simple home in one of the neighborhoods outside of El Seybo.

","en":"Lucinda is 25 years old, and she lives in the house that she inherited four years ago along with her husband Edgar and their son Jhon.  Five years ago she began working in the field of agriculture.  Together with her husband they share the household responsibilities since that is not the only thing that they are dedicated to.  For her part, Lucinda takes care of their animals, raising pigs, sheep, cows and bulls, which she fattens and then sells.  Her husband, meanwhile, is in charge of organizing the planting of potatoes, beans, corn and peas.  \"We both have to work, since in the periods of planting and harvesting, there is a lot of work,\" she affirms.  Because they plant in quantity, their lands are not sufficient, so they have to rent some fields, and for this reason she greatly desires to improve their income, so that they can save and buy more land and not spend so much on rent.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Puntaman puririsum Sachamarca,\" which in Spanish means \"Adelante caminemos Sachamarca\" and in English \"Walking Forward Together (in the town of) Sachamarca.\"  This is her third credit with MFP and she very much likes the work that she accomplishes with her group.  In each meeting she learns new ideas for planting crops, since everyone helps and cooperates, and for that reason she promises to be punctual in the payment of her fees.  \r\n\r\nLucinda will invest now in the purchase of 30 sacks of natural fertilizers and if there is sufficient money she will also buy a pair of sheep.

Now she cannot work as she did before, because she has problems with her right foot, but she does not become discouraged, since she is a woman who likes challenges. A year ago she opened a little grocery store in her home, where she sells basic products.

He was widowed 4 years ago, so since then he no longer receives the help of his wife, who always accompanied him during the long workdays of harvesting and planting. He feels a little sad when he talks about her. He affirms that his love for his children and their happiness motivate him to move forward. Thanks to his work he managed to acquire 10 hectares of his own agricultural land. He plants only 4 hectares with potatoes, beans, and corn, and the others he gave to his children. Now he works with the help of laborers, whom he hires when he needs help.

She has been in these businesses for 25 years and is able to earn about 20,000 KHR per day. For her, low crop yields remain the main challenge to affect her income. To overcome her challenge, especially to recover the loss, she has formed a group of three female members to ask for new loan. This is the third loan cycle for Lai with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. She has successfully repaid the entire loan which has helped her to grow her rice on time and maintain her standard of living. Now she leads a group of three female members to seek for a new loan. Neang is going to use her loan portion to buy rice seed and fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes to gradually improve her family's living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1155989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her income so as to improve her standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1158142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-09T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-08T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sideth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56000},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":952000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301522252},{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288603},{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315519121},{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118677},{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265747},{"amount":14,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":57022.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640999},{"amount":41,"local_amount":164000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":166993.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197076},{"amount":225,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":916426.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841247}],"funded_date":"2012-08-09T12:18:33Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:26:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":457705,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is married with four children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.            \r\n                 \r\nLuzviminda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

In this way, she is helping her son who is a migrant worker in Russia. \r\n\r\nIn 1990, in the search of a source of income for her family, Shaken started her business of livestock breeding with a starting sum of 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to persistence and perseverance, her farm today counts five heads of cattle and 15 sheep, and the monthly income is around 5,000 som (KGS) from sale of dairy and meat products. Further, Shaken processes 1.72 hectares of land, where she grows beans. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Shaken turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of dairy cows. In the future, Shaken wants to enlarge the farm and expand her business through the sale of dairy products to the neighboring Kazaksthan"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1160368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"May village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-08-09T06:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-08T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shaken","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T09:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25080.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329960},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25080.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459635},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-28T08:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25080.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458774},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25080.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495330}],"funded_date":"2012-08-09T22:27:54Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":457707,"name":"Bernie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernie is married with eight children.

Among the lines of work are selling vegetables, selling medicine, making clothes, a mini-market, knitted goods, selling decorations, a store, selling clothes, and providing services, among others.  All of the members are from the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nTeresa is the treasurer of the communal bank.  In the photo she is standing in the last row, second from the right.  She has on a black jacket, and her hair is dark brown.  She is wearing it down, and she has on large silver colored earrings. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling beauty products and bedding like sheets for three years.  She works from Monday through Sunday.  She sees to her business at home, and she arranges her schedule according to her availability.  She buys her merchandise, bales of clothing, at warehouses.  She buys the beauty products by catalogs.  She gets them at low prices, which is cost-effective.  She will use the loan to buy bales of clothes and beauty products.\r\n\r\nOne of Teresa\u2019s goals for her business is to have a stable business where she is able to sell all types of clothes and add the sale of perfumes.  She wants to do this in order to generate greater income.  This way she can choose to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nTeresa lives with her husband and four children, ages 12, 9, 5, and 3.  Her dreams on a personal level are to continue with the business and to have more resources at home.  This is because the children are growing, and while they are growing the need to give them a good life also grows.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity provided by Fondo Esperanza.  It will allow her to invest in her business.  She says that the trainings have been essential for her business and for her personal development.  She has learned to organize and distribute her income and investments in a better way.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is 670 kilometers south of Santiago (capital of Chile).  On the outskirts there are a series of lakeside resorts (Pucon, Villarica) and striking native flora and fauna concentrated in the nearby natural parks. Half of the Mapuche people, an indigenous group in Chile, live in this region.\r\n

There are twenty members, all with businesses such as clothes sales, stallholders, crafts, firewood sales, baker, weaving, services etc. They all live in the town of Temuco.\r\n\r\nRony is the President. He can be seen in the photo standing in the back row second from the right and wearing a dark brown jacket and a blue wool hat. He has earned his living for the last two years selling lemons and carrots in the various local markets. He works from 7:30am to 6:30pm. Rony buys the produce in small stores or sometimes in supermarkets at low prices, whichever is more financially beneficial. With the loan he plans to buy bags of lemons.\r\n\r\nOne of Rony's business goals is to have a permanent stall in the market so that he can have a calmer place in which to work, earn more money, and thus have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRony lives with his wife and two children aged 5 and 3. On a personal level his dream is to one day own a furniture workshop in his home as he does well in this line of work. However, he lacks the necessary tools to start this business. As well, he needs to spend more money in the home because his children are growing so he has to provide them with a good start to life.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy and grateful to have this opportunity with Fondo Esperanza which will allow him to invest in his business. Commenting on his Community Bank, he says that the members communicate well with each other. As well, the training provided has given him the opportunity to learn new sales and accounting techniques.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the region of Araucan\u00eda. The town is located 670 km south of Santiago, the capital of Chile.

She then opens her store and doesn\u2019t close until 10 at night.  She has no needs since her husband helps her tend to customers.  What she sells the most is vegetables, fruit, rice, sugar, oil, chickens, grains, soft-drinks, milk, cured meats, etc. which are the products she\u2019ll buy with the loan to stock up.

years old, married and taking care and raising five children, the youngest of whom is one years old.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 2007 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, today her business contains two, four calves, ten sheep and one horse, and the monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).  Gulzar also works on 5.5 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and barley.  In order to further develop her business, Gulzar requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls and sheep for fattening up.  In the future, she wants to increase her farm and expand her business by buying purebred livestock in order to save money and pay for her 16 year-old son's university education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1160406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Thanks to persistence and hard work, today her business contains two cows, sixteen sheep and twenty-three goats, and the monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Anara requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows.

He has been doing his job for many years. He lives with his wife. All of their children moved out of their parents' house. \r\n\r\nMr. Jijigee's house has some problems such as heat loss and damages to the roof and inside the walls. He is planning to make repairs and insulate the walls with rock, wool, cement and foam. He believes his home will be warmer after the insulation and after he adds a new furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long, cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 Fahrenheit, even in the cities.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Additionally, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers green loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy natural gas for cars. The loan Mr. Jijigee is taking will be used to buy building materials for home repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1159053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He lives with his wife and two daughters in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic yurt in the ger district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nThe ger in winter is cold. His two daughters always get sick from the cold in their home. To improve the situation, Mr. Bayanmunkh has started building a house for his family. He is planning to install an electric heating panel in his new home. As he says, \u201cit is very useful and healthy to the environment and health of the people.\" Moreover, it is very economical. He can cut the cost of his coal fuel by having electric heating. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold with snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night by families just trying to stay warm.  Also, the toxic smoke from the cars is one of main causes of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this situation, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems, and to buy cars that run on natural gas. The loan Mr. Bayanmunkh is taking will cover the cost of a new electric heating panel for his new family house.

San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez.  She is the mother of three children who are currently in elementary school in their hometown.  Felisa is a business woman and she works with great spirit.  She travels on Thursdays and Saturdays to the city of Joyabaj in the state of Quiche in order to sell chickens at a better price than what she buys them for in her hometown market.  She is able to sell them in pairs, which provides an average of 1200 chicks per month.  She is able to earn a 25% return.  She also works raising pigs in her home.  Felisa feels very happy since with her income she is able to provide for her children, along with her husband, what is necessary in order for the kids to study.  Now her greatest hope is to gain more customers and to travel to other markets in order to sell her chickens, since she has begun along with her husband the construction of a home, seeing the need as their children grow up.  She trusts in God to give them strength and the means to reach their goal in the least time possible.

They have been in this business for ten years. The current business earns them about KHR 10,000 per day to spend for the family\u2019s needs. This is Choun\u2019s group loan with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund, and her group has two members.

He grows corn and sorghum. He has worked in agriculture for years, and this has given him a lot of experience that always allows him to obtain the best harvests. The land he farms is in an area with a lot of agricultural activity and is close to his residence. He sells in all the areas near his town, and he has a lot of customers, since people know that everything he sells is of the highest quality and at low prices. Additionally, the service is unequalled, and he is always at his customers' disposal. Vicente is a very responsible, honest, and humble man. He is always awaiting new opportunities since he knows that that is the only way he will succeed. Vicente is a motivated and very hard-working man. He likes to work hard because he knows it is the secret of success. In the last planting he had a lot of losses due to the weather, so this harvest season he wants to increase his production. However, he needs capital to back the purchase of supplies, so he is asking INTEGRAL for a loan that allows him to buy corn seed, sorghum, herbicide, manure, etc. Vicente has good payment references and he promises that he will be able to pay back the debt and at the same time offer his family financial security."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1155857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy corn seed, sorghum, herbicide, and manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-09T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-08T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":305,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":305}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.75,"local_amount":49.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330217},{"amount":152.95,"local_amount":143.54,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846939},{"amount":119.3,"local_amount":111.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":119.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448400}],"funded_date":"2012-08-12T19:51:35Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":457860,"name":"Rosefel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosefel is from Sepac, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

He lives with his life partner and their two children. He grows cereals such as corn, beans and sorghum. He has been working in agriculture for many years and has accumulated very valuable experience, which allows him to obtain very good crops. The plot of land where he sows is located in a highly agricultural area. He makes his sales in all the neighboring areas and he has a lot of customers. People prefer to buy from him because they're certain that everything he sells is high quality at low prices, and also the service is one of a kind, always at his customers' disposal. Roberto is a man who's dedicated to his work, enthusiastic and very responsible. He wants to succeed and knows that he'll achieve that if he puts all of his efforts and love into his work. The last crop didn't meet all of his expectations, and that's why on this sowing season he wants to increase production and needs to buy supplies.

He operates a farming business, growing beans and maize.  He has been a farmer for many years and says that he has learned what it takes to bring in good harvests.  The land that he rents is well situated for crops.  He sells in local markets and has many customers.  They seek him out because they know that he can deliver a good product at a reasonable price.  Armando is an honest, hard-working man with a strong drive to get ahead.  He's always looking for new opportunities that can lead to new successes.

In this occasion Marleni will invest the loan she has requested in the purchase of products such as beer and pork meat for her activities.\r\nMarleni works very hard and she makes sacrifices because she wants to see her children attend university, and it is for them she is making all these sacrifices.\r\nShe is deeply grateful to KIVA for allowing her to offer a better standard of living to her family and a better education to her children, and for helping her in strengthening her activities and in making them grow.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1157017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy beer and pork meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Saylla - Cusco - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2012-08-10T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-09T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":453.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":471.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":489.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":509.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":529.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":547.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":173.72,"local_amount":453.19,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":455.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301336126},{"amount":180.61,"local_amount":471.16,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":473.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308092181},{"amount":187.78,"local_amount":489.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":492.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315326177},{"amount":195.23,"local_amount":509.29,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:04:33Z","rounded_local_amount":512.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322934680},{"amount":202.97,"local_amount":529.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":532.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331067291},{"amount":209.69,"local_amount":547.02,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":550.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339455793}],"funded_date":"2012-08-27T15:56:51Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T13:55:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":456782,"name":"Mar\u00eda Alejandra De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Alejandra de cuarenta y nueve a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus hijos, ella se dedica a la agricultura especialmente al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, tiene varios a\u00f1os de trabajar en el rubro y se ha hecho de experiencia valiosa que le permite mejorar en su labor para obtener siempre las mejores cosechas, el terreno de cultivo es apto para la siembra y ubicado en una zona cercana a su vivienda, comercia en todos los lugares aleda\u00f1os a la comunidad y tiene mucha clientela que la prefieren porque siempre tiene lo que  necesitan a precios bajos, adem\u00e1s se caracteriza por su gran amabilidad y buen servicio;

He works in agriculture, specifically the cultivation of corn, and he has been doing this for 31 years. He is very proud because his many years of work have given him very valuable experience that he uses daily in his work, which allows him to obtain the best harvests. The land that he cultivates is located in a very strong agricultural region, a perfect place for planting with fertile soil. He sells in the areas surrounding his community and he has many clients who prefer his goods as he sells quality products at a low price.

He is 45 years old, married and has four children.  Many people in the district know him because he cooks delicious national dishes.  This is why, in search of a source of income, he opened a cafe across from a market in 2005 and now has many regular customers.  His sons and wife help him with the business, and he used his earnings to build and repair a house and also bought a car.  Besides this business, he grows agricultural crops.  Abdusattor wants to expand his business and plans to purchase ice-cream-making equipment and several bags of rice and also butter.
