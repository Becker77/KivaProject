She married husband Miguel 19 years ago, and together they have two children, ages 18 and 15. This happy family lives in their own home in the center of Kivinaki, province of Chanchamayo, Peru. Kivinaki is a place for growing fruit, such as oranges and tangelos, produce to which Vilma dedicates a lot of her time. She also grows avocados and bananas on a smaller scale. With this job she was able to educate her children, who also help her in the field. Care for her crops is constant, so she has to rely on workers to tend to her land. Her husband is a construction worker, so they both add to the family finances. And since Vilma is a nonconformist, she also spends time working as a kindergarten teacher in the community of Yaroni. \"I like to feel busy,\" she says proudly. \"What I do makes me feels good. I can provide my family what it needs to live in a decent way.\" In the future she would like to set up rooms in her home because she sees a lucrative business in renting out rooms. This will be her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she welcomes the support in advance. She feels content to belong to the \"Las Semillitas de Kivinaki\" community bank because she knows working together will produce better results. With the loan, she plans to hire workers for her orange and banana crops.

Sabina sees this as a business opportunity as she can target these people as potential customers. She also makes her products attractive by allowing her customers to pay in small amounts at a time. She has learned that not all of her clients can afford to buy these items for the full price at the time of purchase, but that they can pay her in small amounts over a two week period. Thus Sabina and her husband have created a business that is convenient and accessible to the community.

Aleisa, where she lives,  is far from the town, so petrol is one of her daily expenses. She has an old van that she uses to transport her cabbages, cucumbers, spring onions and flowers to the market. Ana is old and not suitable for hard work like digging holes in the garden, and so she hires two boys from her neighborhood to dig the holes for her. She is on her seventh loan and has received $4,000. Ana is requesting this loan to fertilize her garden and improve her home.

Juan hopes to purchase another taxi to give himself some time to rest, to offer a better service to his customers, and to provide a stable family and economic situation for his youngest son. Juan's wishes for his sons is that they reach the goals that have set for themselves, and he feels very proud to know that his sons are able to overcome the obstacles they meet.  \r\n\r\nJuan sells various merchandise, and also owns a taxi. He started 15 year ago selling pants, shirts and underwear to friends and neighbors, and little by little increase the merchandise he offered and the number of customers. He saved part of the profits from the clothing sales to buy a taxi. Both businesses allowed him to support his sons, but the taxi has been the main source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nThe loan Juan is requesting  will be used a work capital. He needs to pay for repairs and maintenance for his vehicle and to invest in more clothing items to distribute among customers who have already placed orders. \r\n\r\nJuan is thankful to Kiva partners

and so is the sole income earner of the family. He has been farming for the last 22 years on his piece of land growing wheat, rice, tomato, cucumber and watermelon.\r\n\r\nRahmatullo would like to adopt new farming technology to boost his agricultural yield as he needs to be able to meet the financial responsibility of educating his children and maintaining his family. But he lacks the capital. He therefore requests a 4,000 Somoni loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for growing his crops. He is very responsible and promises to repay the loan on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives with this wife and children in the Faraba district of Bougouni City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having gone to school, he got interested at an early age in income-generating work.  For ten years, he used to work daily with merchants, especially in merchandise transport by cart at the marketplace and in the different district of Bougouni, though he was unsuccessful.  So he decided to learn from his uncle how to sell various shop goods.  For four years now, he has been working at this business and is in high demand. \r\n\r\nTo bolster his business, he decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  He is now on his first individual loan, which he intends to use to buy various goods for his shop.  He stocks up in Bamako (capital of Mali).  His customers are composed of local people. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to realize a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that he envisions using to expand his shop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is 32 years old. Elsie is married with 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsie owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not her only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elsie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation as well as her ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Elsie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and save for future use. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He\u2019s married to Donata, 54, and they have three children who are all now independent.  This couple lives in their own home and most of their life is dedicated to potato farming.  He learned farming skills when he was very young from his parents who taught him how to be a good tuber farmer.\r\n\r\nDuring harvest time his wife helps him.  Generally, she tends to their animals like: sheep, cows, bulls, pigs and asses, an activity she\u2019s been in since they got married.  Selling animals has sheltered them from the economic crisis.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys the most about farming is harvesting potatoes and sorting them by size.  What annoys him are customers that try to cheat him on the price, so much work for so little economic reward.  He will continue planting but in larger amounts.  In addition, he will grow a variety of tubers like the native one and the colored ones that are in highest demand in the market.\r\n\r\nThis is his 4th loan with MFP and because he\u2019s familiar with the work methodology of his communal group he feels proud to be part of a unified group that\u2019s willing to get ahead and save in an organized fashion.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested funds to buy several sacks of fertilizer to improve his tuber production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":552316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aniceto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1850.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326797}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T08:16:47Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":210947,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita V. is from the village of Tuburan in Cagayan de Oro City.

She lives in her own home, with her husband and their teenage son. Since over 7 years ago, she has sold household goods, vegetables and general groceries from the front room of her house. Her customers are the housewives from her neighbourhood, who appreciate the attentive service she offers them. Her store is the busiest in the area, so she stocks up with plenty of chicken, meat, vegetables and fresh fruit - perishable every day products. Lucia is happy with the business she has built: it is calm and enjoyable to work there, and at the same time she can take care of her home and her family's wellbeing.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, she hopes to grow and diversify her business - for instance she would like to have a bookshop, because no-one in her area is in that line of business. This is Lucia's 15th loan with [field partner] MFP, and she promises to make all her repayments on time as she has been doing up to now. She also looks forward to working with her companions in the communal bank. She will invest the loan she is seeking in buying products so that she can supply her customers' demands.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":584955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional stock for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":444.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":460.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":492.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":509.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":536.29},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":556.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.17,"local_amount":444.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":446.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887493},{"amount":165.18,"local_amount":460.96,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":462.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154494},{"amount":176.56,"local_amount":492.72,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":494.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449804},{"amount":182.48,"local_amount":509.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":511.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588501},{"amount":192.17,"local_amount":536.29,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":538.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725010},{"amount":199.44,"local_amount":556.58,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":559.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463097}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T18:15:59Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":227336,"name":"Katy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROSPERIDAD\u201d; este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

This is 34-year-old Rukia R. from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of 3 and 13 years old. Rukia has been running a tailoring business since 2005 making clothes for women. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week. She currently earns about $100 from her business.\r\n\r\nRukia is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase machines and to renovate her building. In the future, she plans to have her own house. Rukia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She lives with her family in their own home, and apart from her children she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nAlzira left Maputo for Boane in 1991 to join her husband, and they still live there today. She has had her own business for more than 18 years and does not have any other employees. She works around 10 hours every day. Her husband is also a business owner and helps to pay the household expenses. Alizira earns approximately 5500.00 Meticales each month, which go towards paying the household expenses. She also saves some money at home in order to cover any unforeseen needs. \r\n\r\nAlzira had previously taken out loans with the credit cooperative TCHUMA but later decided not to continue for various reasons. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] one day when she was passing by the Institution, as she entered and found out about the options available there. This is her 3rd loan, for the amount of 25,000.00 Meticales. She will use this money to buy capulanas [long pieces of fabric that have various uses] in order to increase and diversify the products she sells. Her earlier loans were for 13,000.00 Meticales e 18,000.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. Her main project is the construction of small houses to rent out. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to put towards her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

During the afternoons she sells clothing and cosmetics. \r\n\r\nShe makes her sales through orders and her customers are people who are responsible in their payments\u2014she sells merchandise to them on credit. Julia is very happy with her sales because they have been very good during the 8 years since she has had this business. At first she lost her capital in this business, because of the credit she extended to people. Since then, when she has new customers she first asks for references in order to sell to them with assurance, or she sells to them for cash up front. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to increase her capital and then buy a vitrine where she can show her merchandise. This is the twelfth loan that she has had with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she will continue being punctual in her payments because she would like to have more loans in the future. In her group she is a very responsible and respected member. She plans to invest the requested money in buying clothing merchandise, so she can continue making progress with her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":544146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"She will buy clothing merchandise to stock her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":169.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":178.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":184.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":149.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934569},{"amount":54.63,"local_amount":156.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":156.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673342},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":162.05,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":162.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887166},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":169.59,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":170.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154177},{"amount":62.32,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":179.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449487},{"amount":64.7,"local_amount":184.87,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":185.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588158}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T13:58:10Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":206867,"name":"Petrona Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

They have four children but only one of their daughters, who\u2019s a single mother and their grandson, Santiago, 4, who Leticia has cared for since birth because her daughter was still in school and is now working as an Accountant, lives with them.\r\n\r\nLeti is asking for her loan to invest in her fine jewelry (gold) business.  She stocks up in the city of Morole\u00f3n, Guanajuato, because she gets good prices there because she\u2019s been a customer there for 12 years.  She is then able to raise prices just a little and not be forced to sell her jewelry for prices that are too expensive.  She comments that she is really putting in much effort into her work because she wants her son, who is studying Law, to finish his career and be able to buy him the textbooks he requires.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals for right now is to acquire customers and sell to people who won\u2019t fall back on their payments, above all to people who have stable employment.  One of her dreams is to rent a locale that she can set up shop in because it\u2019s quite dangerous to be carrying fine jewelry in the street. Another one of her dreams is to be able to repair her house because in the rainy season there are leaks.\r\n\r\nElvia B. L\u00f3pez is also part of the \u201cLAS AUDACES\u201d group.  She is 43 years old and finished 8th graD..  She comments that she was unable to finish her education because her parents didn\u2019t have enough money to continue paying her school costs.  Elvia is married to Lemuel who sells animals like sheep and cows.  They have 6 children but only one of them, named Ricardo who works with his father and helps sell the animals, lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe sells catalogue beauty products like creams, cosmetics, etc.  She also sells women\u2019s lingerie by catalogue.  She has been in this business for about 6 years.  She decided to go into it to help her husband meet their children\u2019s expenses because there was a time when they were all in school and they had to pay tuition and rent in other cities where they were studying.  Elvia is asking for her loan to invest in lingerie and cosmetics to have stock on hand and not have to place orders because this is time consuming.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members are: Ma. Guadalupe Jim\u00e9nez Rojas, Irma M. Andr\u00e9s, Ma. Maribel V\u00e1zquez Araujo, Yolanda M. Vilchis, Avelina L. Morales, Amalia D. L. C. Colector, Jhovanna Elizabeth Guzm\u00e1n Flores, Ver\u00f3nica Vel\u00e1zquez Araujo and Viridiana M. Lorenzo.  They want the loan to invest in catalogue shoe sales, catalogue natural medicine sales, clothing sales, Internet caf\u00e9, nutritional club, etc.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":659290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy fine jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ZITACUARO, ESTADO DE MICHOAC\u00c1N","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-08T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have four young children and live in their own home in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  She is an enterprising woman who started growing \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lepidium_meyenii\" target=\"_blank\" >maca<\/a>\u201d five years ago since it is a prized crop.  The land on which she plants is in a remote part of her community that is beautiful and spacious.  At first Eulalia sold her crop to brokers who transported her product to the city of Jun\u00edn.  After she determined that the \u201cmaca\u201d she produced was of good quality, Eulalia received an offer to sell her harvest to a beverage processing company in Lima that uses this product.  Since then, she began investing in her crop in order to improve its quality.  Eulalia earns a yearly net income between 9000 to 10,000 PEN.  For this reason, she plans to open her own \u201cmaca\u201d processing company so that she can expand her business and generate more earnings in the short term.  \r\n<p>\r\nEulalia is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de San Pedro\u201d (Heart of San Pedero) and this will be her third loan with MFP.

She increased her \u201cmaca\u201d sales orders this year, but her crop has yet to be harvested.  This is why she is requesting assistance.  Eulalia will invest the money she requested in the hiring of workers to help harvest the \u201cmaca\u201d.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":844640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers to help with harvesting.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family. She and her husband have raised seven children.\r\n \r\nIn 2010, Fofoa joined SPBD* to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fofoa's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Thanks to that work, he generated his own capital fund. \r\n\r\nMr. Sangar\u00e9 has been selling cooking oil for six years now.  Enjoying tremendous popularity with the women who visit the Ch\u00e2teau marketplace in the city of S\u00e9gou, he sells exclusively at the retail level and uses a hand pump as a measuring device.  (Each turn of the crank costs 100 francs CFA, the local currency).\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the demand from his continuously growing customer base, he is requesting the assistance of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which he is on his first individual loan.  He intends to use this loan to buy 600 liters of cooking oil (being three drums worth) from wholesale merchants locally at the grand marketplace of the city of S\u00e9gou. \r\n\r\nAt the Ch\u00e2teau marketplace of S\u00e9gou, Mr. Sangar\u00e9 makes his sales out of a shed to customers generally composed  of housewives and restaurateurs, cash or credit accepted.  Because of the regular increase of customers, Mr. Sangar\u00e9 is thinking of becoming a reference in his domain in S\u00e9gou in the years to come.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Argemiro  seeks a credit of $2.000.000 COP and wants to invest in a large purchase of chains, belts, shackles and tracks for tractor-trailers because they are the articles that are most asked for and most expensive.\r\n\r\nHe began his business selling door to door in the streets of the neighborhood of El Bosque accompanied by his only son. At the beginning he sold products like padlocks, watches and glasses, but as a capitalizing man, he began to sell the merchandise that he currently sells. He has had four previous credits with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that have helped him to capitalize his business and this is how he was able to establish himself on a single corner in the same neighborhood that is close to various transportation and heavy cargo businesses. For his good treatment, kindness and responsibility he has won over the clientele in his area, the majority of whom are owners of tractor-trailers and this his how he positioned his business as it is today. The credits from Fundaci\u00f3n have given him greater earnings and more family income with which he has been able to improve his household and to generate income to maintain the work of he and his son and daughter and grandchildren. \r\n\r\nAs his stall is in a public space, he always keeps it clean and orderly and has the support of the businesses in the area, he is afraid that they would make him leave this site. Because of this, his goal is to find a place where he can afford the lease and that is located in a place that is spacious and close so that he can maintain more variety in products and to acquire other lines that have connection with the market that he works with.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007 IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Pasil, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. He earns his living operating a fishing business.  His wife Mary Grace, 32, works as a vendor and also helps in her husband\u2019s fishing activities. They have three children who are between three and eight years old. \r\n\r\nAllan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Allan has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped him earn a monthly profit of 11,500 PHP, raising his family's standard of living.  This time, for his tenth loan, he is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which he intends to use to purchase fishing gear and equipment so that he can continue to save up for the future education of his children. Allan G. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in getting their land sown.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Samuel M. has requested a loan of 170,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":237848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T17:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821555},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357821},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046871},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938489},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396155},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":42500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":45151.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904032},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126040}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T09:50:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83141,"name":"Mawuena","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1949 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9, Mme D.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p> \r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":337634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another sewing machine.

She lives in the house that she inherited from her parents.  She has a great desire to get ahead in life.  Every day she walks the streets of the city of Juliaca, together with her inseparable cosmetics bag, looking for customers who want to buy some of her products.  She is very happy, and she always waits on people with a smile on her lips.  What Maria likes most about her work is advising her customers about which product will give them the best results.  The most difficult is having to walk all day under the cruel sun while she goes door to door visiting her customers.  This makes her very tired.  Mar\u00eda has been doing this for five years.

At 61 years old, Ninda E. lives in Purok Paraiso, a neighborhood of Barangay Taloc in Bago City, located in Negros Occidental Province on the Western Visayas islands. She and her husband, Antonio, are still working hard to improve the quality of their family\u2019s life. \r\n<p>\r\nAntonio works as a rice farm laborer. This was his source of income when he and Ninda were married and started their family. Back then with four young children, they found themselves in dire straits living well below the poverty line, sometimes having no food to feed their children. It was then that Ninda became determined to raise her children's quality of life by earning her own income to help her husband support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, she decided to try her luck and applied to join NWTF Project Dungganon so that she could get good business advice and guidance if she were accepted as a member. She passed all the necessary requirements, and with her first loan she built a sari-sari (general store) adjacent to their house. Once she had saved up enough, she widened the variety of goods she sold in her store. With the help of her income from her general store, Ninda's children were able to go to school and finish their college education. Presently NInda earns a minimum monthly income of 3,750 PHP. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Ninda is requesting a loan of 19,500 PHP to purchase additional products to sell in her general store. Her previous loan, also 19,500 PHP, was fully utilized as additional working capital for her general store. She paid her installments every week and fully paid off the loan within its term. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a mother of three children, one of whom is a seamstress in a garment factory, while another is attending local public school, and the youngest one is only one year old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Green Transportation, LLC is a full-time food delivery service.  Erica S., owner of Nola Green Transportation, manages food delivery for restaurants that do not have the delivery volume to merit having their own drivers.  By using NGT, restaurants can offer delivery service to their clients without losing the time it takes to deliver.  \n\nOriginally a Texas native, Erica moved to New Orleans after high school to attend Tulane University.  Unable to obtain sufficient financial aid for her studies, she went back to working full-time at a restaurant \u2013 something she had been doing since she was 14.  She says she first had the idea of NGT when she began noticing the time that was lost when restaurant staff had to take off to deliver an order.\n\nErica has rolling two-month contracts with restaurants, meaning the contracts automatically renew unless the restaurant decides to opt out.  Some current clients include Mexican, Moroccan, Middle-Eastern, Spanish and Cajun restaurants.  Erica\u2019s drivers pick up the food from the restaurants and deliver it to the customers.  Right now, Erica has two drivers and will soon hire a third.\n\nErica is using this loan for operating capital, payment of accumulated debts, and for two months of office rent.  She always needs cash on hand because her drivers are sub-contractors (they buy the food from the restaurants and then collect payment from the customers).  At the end of the day, Erica reimburses her drivers for the money they pay the restaurants.  When Erica\u2019s customers pay with credit cards, Erica does not receive payment from the credit card companies for two days.  This loan gives Erica the needed cushion to pay her drivers until she receives payment from the credit card companies.\n\nRight now, Erica consistently works 13- and 14-hour days.  Though these are long hours, she likes owning her own business because of the freedom it provides her.  She recommends other business owners be realistic when setting goals \u2013 things take three times longer than you think they should.  With the added hassle of billing through credit card companies, she also recommends dealing in cash whenever possible.\n\nErica opened Nola Green Transportation, LLC in September, 2010.  She says NGT\u2019s biggest success so far is that it became profitable within the first four months of opening.  Her 5 year plan for the business is to expand to all of New Orleans, which will require opening an additional five offices, each with its own operational setup, throughout the city.  Erica is 22 years old.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":710746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For

in a simple farmer's family, and from an early age she started helping her parents on the farm. Jipargul got married at the age of 19, and gave birth to two daughters and a son in 1989, 1990 and 1993.  In 1994, in search of a source of income for her family, she began to resell rice at the market in Osh (southern Kyrgyzstan).  After two years, she had gathered enough money by reselling rice, and she moved with her family to the capital, Bishkek.  There, she worked as a shoe reseller at a local market. Launching her business with an initial amount of 35,000 som (KGS), she became a successful entrepreneur who had regular customers. In 2000, after giving birth to her youngest son, Jipargul took a loan to expand her business and started to import shoes from China, using wholesale buyers from neighboring Kazakhstan as business partners.  With the revenues generated from this business, Jipargul was able to buy a house for her family.  Unfortunately, her business collapsed on the day when her partners disappeared with a shipment of merchandise, leaving her with huge debts.  Jipargul had to sell her property in Bishkek and in 2010 she moved to the village of Voznesenovka.  Her husband, being her main support in life, always helped and supported his wife during the family's difficult times.  He started to work in animal husbandry, turning his activity into a family business and encouraged Jipargul to join him.  Thanks to the perseverance and tenacity of Jipargul's family, their farming business now comprises two dairy cows and a bull and brings about 10,000 som (KGS) per month through the sale of dairy and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, Jipargul has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of\r\n100,000 som (KGS) which will be used to buy additional livestock. Jipargul and her husband now have one dream: to use future revenues to build a good house and to further increase their number of farm animals.

She is married and has two children aged 10 and 6. Mary has a hair salon business. She started braiding her sisters' hair when she was young and believes that she was born with this talent.  \r\nIn 2005, Mary started her business by braiding her customers' hair in their own homes, while others would come over to her house for the service. With time, her customer base grew, and Mary needed to settle in one place from where she would provide the service to the customers. \r\nWhen she started out, she only had one small mirror and one chair, both of which she bought with proceeds from her hair-braiding work. These cost her Ksh. 650 (US$10). In December 2006, Mary joined a small co-operative that was giving small loans to the youth in her area. She was able to obtain a loan of Ksh. 6,500 (US$100) which she used to buy four plastic chairs, one large mirror, some towels, and an assortment of combs. She has managed to repay the loan. However, the co-operative is unable to give Mary more funds -the maximum amount she could access was Ksh. 10,000 (US$155). Mary still needs financial help, since, with the equipment that she has, she is not able to wash and straighten hair. She wishes to provide a complete service to her customers, also in order to help them save the time that they use by going to another salon that is far away. \r\nMary is asking for a loan Of US$550 which will be repayable within a period of 12 \u2013 18 months. With this loan Mary will be able to acquire some equipment for her salon, including a hair drier, a steamer, a blow drier, and hair chemicals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":47005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a hair drier, hair steamer, blow drier and hair chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-07-05T22:39:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-20T09:51:03Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-09-29T09:18:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":60092},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T10:18:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73535},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-29T10:20:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88389},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-29T10:17:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":104514},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-29T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123820},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144909},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":168510},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-04-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195268},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-05-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222463},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-06-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251690},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-07-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":280440},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-08-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":310086}],"funded_date":"2007-07-06T09:51:03Z","paid_date":"2008-08-29T09:01:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":17597,"name":"Sudaba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sudaba is 40 years old, and has been in this business for one year.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":237874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a solid business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 38 years old, married, and the father of 3 children who are 13, 10, and 6 years old.  All of them attend school.  He only finished 5th grade and did not continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone else.  \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Boane with his siblings in 1992 in order to search for a better life.  He has had his own business for more than 17 years and does not have any employees.  He works daily from 7am to 5pm and earns about 5,000 MZN per month, which he uses to pay for household expenses.  He even saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has had other loans through the TCHUMA credit cooperative, but he later decided not to continue with them for various reasons.  He found out about Hluvuku through friends who also have benefitted from the services of this institution.  This is his 3rd loan, which has a value of 25,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy goods (skirts, suits, and other types of clothes) in order to increase his supply.  The previous loans were for 11,000 MZN and 15,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.  \r\n\r\nHe promises to duly pay back this loan in order to have access to others.  In the future, he would like to request more loans to finish building his house in order to offer better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika
