Saidaly currently lives with his family in a three-bedroom apartment.  He bought a plot of land two years ago and started to build a house because he has dreamed of living in a custom-built house all his life.  He has been building his house for two years.  He built the main part, but paint work for the interior and exterior of the house, ceilings, walls and installation of doors and windows in the rooms, bathroom and sauna remain.

His work is very hard since some days he has to make several trips that last hours: \u201cI have to help him, especially on Fridays, market days, when the inhabitants go down to the city.\u201d she states. She also works taking care of an elderly women in the city, where she rented the house a short while ago because that is also where their children attend school. Now she wants to finalize the permits for their auto so she can work with her husband and she also wants to buy another car and thus increase their earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan from MFP and during this time she was able to make good use of the development opportunities offered her since she had the necessary capital, thanks to these loans. Consequently she promises to be punctual in making her payments. This time Celina will invest in paying for the formalities involved in driving their automobile, as the driver\u2019s license has expired, and the rest of the permits for transporting passengers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1157271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

He lives with his spouse and daughter and enjoys very good references and a united family.  He lives in a community dedicated to commerce, agriculture and animal husbandry.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a person who started being a great, responsible worker from a very young age whose only goal was to give his family the best.  Because of this, Santiago has been working in carpentry at home in Cayalti in north Per\u00fa.  He provides his community with a key service needed to repair objects or parts of houses that are often in poor condition as well as designing furniture for homes or businesses.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s because of this that Santiago is looking for a 1600 sol loan from Edpyme Alternativa with Kiva support to buy more merchandise (cedar lumber, glue, mahogany, etc.) to stock his business and sales thus meeting currently unmet customer demand.  He will expand his clientele leading to new, additional income for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1157279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy carpentry supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed -

Mauricio has owned Amazon Art for over seven years. He began his business in the Amazon region of Brazil in 2005.  In October of 2011, Mauricio established Amazon Art Import and Export in the US to improve the exportation of products made by Native Brazilians. Mauricio has done extensive research on the Brazilian Rainforest as well about the native culture of the region. Throughout his studies, Mauricio has marked the unique cultural changes taking place in the Amazon due in large part, to migration to the cities.  The migration to cities and increased movement of the Amazon peoples has resulted in numerous cultural and religious evolvements.  Mauricio began his business with the purpose of preserving the authenticity of the original Amazon culture.  He captures Amazon culture through art.

He hopes to have favorable results that will allow him to achieve his dream: to keep supporting his home and doing what he likes so much. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1156670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilzer, seeds, insecticides, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-11T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-10T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ferm\u00edn Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330230}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T22:13:37Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":456857,"name":"Elsa Mirian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nElsa Mirian tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad y habita junto a su grupo familiar el cual est\u00e1 conformado por su esposo y sus hijos.

Alongside her husband, she has worked tirelessly growing corn and beans for many years. Agriculture is their principal source of income. She is ambitious, hardworking, and above all responsible. She wakes up very early in the morning to take care of her household responsibilities and then heads out to help her husband in agricultural activities. Year by year they go through the same process of planting basic grains, harvesting crops, and then selling them. Her family is precious to her, and they are why she works hard.

He grows corn and squash and has been in agriculture for several years, so this has given him a lot of experience which allows him to do a better job.  He likes his harvests to get better and better because this means he will stay ahead of the competition.  His cropland is in a fertile area and very well-suited to this type of crops.

She is now borrowing a loan of P10,000 in order to buy medicine and hog feed. It will help maintain good growth of her hogs. Someday, though she has only a small piggery, she hopes to keep increasing her sales for all her children's education.

She makes a living by farming, particularly corn. She has been working on this field for many years and has gained precious experience that allows her to improve her technique and get the best harvests. Her land plot is located in a highly agricultural zone, very close to her home too. She sells her produce nearby her community and has a lot of regular customers.

Rosa is an admirable woman, full of energy and dreams she wishes to fulfill. She is always looking for opportunities that can pave her way to success.

He has run the family business for several years. He has a family of his own now so works even harder. Victor sells firewood and charcoal as the farm has a lot of trees planted by many generations of the family.\r\n\r\nHis wife helps him with the business as he is sometimes busy cutting the wood, a long and strenuous job because he doesn't own any machinery. Victor works every day; this doesn't bother him as he is accustomed to hard work. His biggest problem is the lack of transportation to deliver the wood and charcoal when his customers have given him orders.\r\n\r\nA few months ago he realized that the place where he makes the charcoal was small and he was rapidly running out of wood. With the loan he plans to renovate the place and also buy some more trees to make firewood.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to help his wife to save enough money so that she can start her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1157800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"With his firewood and charcoal business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Milagro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-11T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-10T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":742.45,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":74.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":76.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.48,"local_amount":66.8,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":67.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340474},{"amount":69.01,"local_amount":68.32,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":69.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096861},{"amount":71.05,"local_amount":70.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":71.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331217},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":71.49,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":72.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939858},{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":73.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072280},{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":74.79,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318635},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":76.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":77.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013379},{"amount":0.31,"local_amount":0.31,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":0.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453742},{"amount":158.12,"local_amount":156.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":158.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087911},{"amount":81.74,"local_amount":80.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":81.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632685},{"amount":3.04,"local_amount":3,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390496603}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T01:08:22Z","paid_date":"2013-08-20T09:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":458417,"name":"Flordelisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flordelisa is 48 years old and married with 6 children.

She is a woman who dreams of progressing in life. After being a farmer for some time and running a retail shop, she decided to start another business so as to increase her monthly income. In 2010, she decided to start a coconut-selling business, selling to the neighboring countryside since there was demand. She stocks the coconuts in her shop.\r\n\r\nRiziki is working hard to ensure that she provides for her children and also can help her husband, who is a businessman, with the household expenses. She says that her major challenge is transportation cost and that she dreams of expanding her business and opening new businesses in the future. Riziki has insufficient capital to increase her inventory, so she is asking for help from Yehu to add stock of coconuts for sale. This will enable her to increase her profits and provide a quality life for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":942445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She started this business 20 years ago when she and her husband had no income, and it has remained their only income in the years since. Her husband takes the milk to the local market almost every day to offer for sale. \r\n\r\nThey have two teenaged children who attend the public high school. The village where the family resides, in the southeastern part of Albania, does not have such a school, so the children go to a different one within the same commune. Eliverta\u2019s dream is for both of their children to attend university, because both of them do very well in school. \r\n\r\nEliverta has received and repaid four previous loans, and she is now requesting her fifth. The loan funds will be used to purchase a milk cow.

and two children whom he loves very much and who are his reason for continuing to fight and make the effort to carry them forward. He is a very friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic person. Unfortunately, because of needing to work and pay his own way, he could not study for a professional career, but he would have liked to be a professor. In his free time he enjoys spending time with his family. On some occasions, they take advantage of the opportunity to eat a delicious barbecued chicken.\r\n\r\nWith much effort and thanks to the support of his family, Germ\u00e1n works day to day in his little brick-selling business. Very early in the morning, he begins making bricks in a little handcrafted oven that he made himself. Germ\u00e1n dedicates approximately twelve hours a day to his business and feels happy in his work, since he feels that things are going well for him because of his good work and loving and respectful treatment of others. \r\n\r\nGerm\u00e1n is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have provided he will be able to buy straw, which is an important material in brick-making. In this way, Germ\u00e1n hopes to be able to expand his sales and increase his income so that in the not-very-distant future he can save up to buy a little motor car to transport his bricks.

flower-covered mountains in winter where there is plenty of the milk and curd made by its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn this municipality, there are many people who are known for being hard workers, such as Fany del Carmen.  She is 44 years old, married, the mother of a school-age daughter, and she has been an accountant for 20 twenty years.  This work has allowed her to provide her young daughter with many things, to giver her a good education, and to build a house with everything she needs.\r\n\r\nThanks to her job and her husband's income, they now have their own home, which they have been improving little by little with the help of loans.  She wants to continue to add to it to leave her daughter a good inheritance.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy medicine and to have some medical tests performed in order to improve her health so she will be more efficient and work and so she can spend more time with her family. \r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and Ceprodel for the help they have given her through these loans, which have helped her improve her family's living conditions, and she hopes that they will continue to help her in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1157914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

She has had this business for several years, but she has only recently started producing and selling banana pies. The preparation is not complicated, but it requires some physical strength. In order to make the pies, one cooks the banana in a large pot with water. Once the banana softens, it is mashed it with a rolling pin until it results in a compact, malleable mass. Then, it is stretched out on a flat surface and shaped into a circle of varying size. This is then filled with chicken, meat, or cheese, depending on preference. Before serving, it is fried in oil. Because the process is a bit long, Manuela's husband helps her with the gathering and the sales. They start at 5:00 am and work until 4:00 pm or when they run out of food.

In 2003 she became an independent female farmer and has been growing grapes and strawberries on her allocated plot of land. After Alie's husband passed away her children continued to help her with the farm. Alie has a 23 year old son who is a student at the National Academy of environmental preservation and tourism and a 22 year old daughter who is studying at the Tavric National university. However, to take care of everything on her 0.11 hectare\/0.3 acre plot of land is a big job and Alie also hires a farmhand to help her. To improve soil condition Alie decided to purchase a motorized tiller which will help her til the soil faster and reduce the number of weeds. \r\n\r\nAlie is very grateful for the help that AKM is offering. AKM returned to her the meaning of life after her husband passed away and gave her the dedication to succeed in her farming business. In the future Alie plans to purchase a motorized sprayer for her plants. She needs to take out this loan to purchase this piece of equipment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1160498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
