She is single and has 2 children with 1 of them currently in school. For the past 8 years, Dorothy has been working hard to manage her tailoring business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Dorothy has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase materials that will make clothes for resale, and will help Dorothy to generate greater profits and pay her medical bills. Dorothy hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business into a training center. \r\n\r\nDorothy is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Dorothy who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1161073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Edith has been a merchant in a district of the capital for four years, and she sells braised fish. Her business is flourishing thanks to her know-how in the field and her experience, which have allowed her to expand her activity over time and generate a loyal customer base. But the small amount of capital she has does not allow her to obtain supplies in bulk, which then leads to constant stock shortages and an increasing drop-off in her clientele. To avoid a permanent loss of customers, she is seeking this loan in order to obtain supplies of fish in bulk, which will allow her to avoid shortages as well as retain her customers and gain new ones. The profits this investment will generate will allow her to expand her business by increasing her points of sale and also to provide for her family's

is 33 years old and lives in a rented room with her spouse in a suburban area of Phnom Penh. She is married and has two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband earn income, Yous has been operating a mobile business. Every day she uses her motorcycle (with a trailer behind her as shown in the picture) to go back and forth around her commune to sell soft drinks such as coffee, lemon tea, coca cola, sting (a type of drink), and pure drinking water. \r\n\r\nWith her profits, she can pay for food, home bills, accommodation costs, and her children's expenses.

It was then that a friend taught her to make a great variety of food and she began to offer food service to her neighbors, family members and friends. Currently, her business keeps growing and, thanks to the possibility to have her own business in her house, she can offer her five children a better quality of life being their caregiver. Additionally, the income for the home has increased from the potential to contribute a greater quantity along with her husband to pay the bills. Thanks to her customers requesting that she sell fast food, Amparao is looking for a loan to buy a fast food cart with which she can prepare food and satisfy her customers' needs.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is that this business keeps growing so that her children and her husband can enjoy better income in the house and a better quality of life.

He would like to invest in raw materials so as to have plenty of stock ready when the high sales season arrives.\r\n\r\nAlberto has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am inspired by the customs and beliefs of Andean villages. I've been a ceramist since I was a child, as my parents taught me the craft. Later, I tried to develop my own pieces with a personal style. My main purpose is giving life to my creations, and I've achieved this through the expressions of their faces, aiming to reflect daily attitudes, Peruvian country scenes, even protests - and I'm satisfied and content. My wife works with me. Most of our pieces are hand-molded, as only the weight of the hand can give the right shape. We use clay and simple tools; pigments are carefully blended together. I hope that my art will be valued for its cultural background.\" \r\n\r\n\"I'd like to send you many blessings and my prayer that God keep you safe, always.

She does not have a rest period because she lives there and takes care of her children. \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest worries is accidents because her house is located in a busy area and she has had several bad experiences as, for example, when a drunk driver crashed into her house and destroyed her business and part of her home. Since she was pregnant at the time the incident left a strong impression on her. Thank God she was able to recover and continue working to make up the loss. That is why she is applying for a loan to purchase products such as rice, sugar, provisions, canned goods, etc. She also needs a display case and to build several cabinets. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to continue with her business for a long time because she would like to refurbish her house and store in order to provide a more promising future for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1158653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, provisions, canned goods, a display case and cabinets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quevedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-12T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-11T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita Jomaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.21,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":92.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":78.67,"local_amount":77.08,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":78.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340477},{"amount":80.48,"local_amount":78.84,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":80.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096866},{"amount":82.97,"local_amount":81.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":82.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331222},{"amount":170.86,"local_amount":167.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":170.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939863},{"amount":88.1,"local_amount":86.31,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318640},{"amount":90.1,"local_amount":88.28,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013384},{"amount":483.82,"local_amount":474.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":483.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453747}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T23:38:27Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:50:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":459035,"name":"Vanny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vanny (pictured above), age 21, is a garment worker.

He has 22 solid years in mixed farming, with his major produce including milk, cabbages, coffee and French peas. Julius also runs a butchery business in the local market.\r\n\r\nJulius has made a loan request of 60,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy a water tank. He says this will enable a supply of water on his farm and the ability to farm in both on and off seasons, and more specifically, banana farming. Julius will channel the major part of his farming income towards his children's education. His  focus is to buy more parcels of land for more expansive coffee farming. Julius says his main challenge remains the low market prices for agricultural products within the local markets.

He purchased a car for his son`s taxi business with his business profit.  \r\n\r\nNow Galsanjamts is requesting 6,000,000 MNT to purchase a good breed of cows.

She and the rest for her family are originally from Kror Kor district of Pursat Province. To strive for the entire family, she has been working on rice farming with her husband for about 10 years as the major source of income. She also supplements additional income via raising chickens for resale. Thary has joined VisionFund for one cycle already and completely paid back the entire loan.

His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages to provide business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the credit received, Besik will purchase piglets. He will place them in an old, empty farm building located in their yard.

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuliza has a small plot of land, where nut is grown. She sells nut in nearby villages. Along with her agricultural business, she is busy with trading. Guliza sells horseshoes in the village. Her average monthly income is 150 Laris. It is hardly enough for food. According to Credo estimations, she belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. \r\n\r\nGuliza requested loan from Credo to start-up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages to provide business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the credit received, Guliza will purchase a dairy cow. She will place it in an old empty farm-building located in her yard. Guliza will work hard in the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of Guliza. Thus, she will be able to improve her living

She started selling ice cream and juices from a window in her home, and little by little, she realized that she was running a business and decided to take a risk and apply for a loan. Two years have passed since then, and now Elsy has a small stand where she sells juices and milkshakes made from all kinds of fruit. Her most frequent clients are students, so she only works in the mornings. She works alone, and only has one blender with which to prepare made-to-order milkshakes from the fruits that her clients want. She sells milkshakes for $2.00, but the price may be higher because there are some fruits that are more expensive. This is Elsy's second loan, and she hopes to buy another blender, a toaster so she can sell toasted cheese and bologna sandwiches, a container, glasses, and the ingredients she uses most--fruits and milk. Elsy hopes that in the near future, she will be able to buy a glass case that will allow her to keep her ingredients fresh, and to move her business to a storefront.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1158659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a blender and toaster.

His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is monthly income from their agricultural business. They have a vineyard and a plot of land where nut trees are grown. They sell nuts and wine at the local open market. The average monthly income of the family is 350 laris. It is hardly enough for food for a five member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category.\r\n\r\nTengiz requested a loan from Credo to start up a new type of business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tengiz plans to open a bakery in his house. He will purchase necessary equipment (stove and dishes) and will start baking bread and candy products which will be sold in the village. This new business initiative, financed with a Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

He has a nursery in his house where he himself tends to his plants. He began his business a while ago with a small garden. He has always enjoyed plants, and when his relatives helped him, he started his business. He sells his plants at both wholesale and retail prices. What he enjoys most is caring for the plants. As a result, it does not feel like work for him as much as a hobby. His is a family business since every member of his family is involved. This is beneficial since everything is cared for better. One of his greatest fears is that his plants will succumb to blight and die, which would cause him to lose the capital he has invested. He will invest the loan he is requesting by purchasing seeds, flower pots, and palms, as well as by making the improvements he wants to make to his nursery to make it more productive.

In 2010, he renovated his mini truck and he plans to continue his business normally in the future. There are four people in his family: he lives with his wife and his two children, a boy and a girl. His wife works as a teacher in the kindergarten and her salary is low. \r\n\r\nSince last year, Batsaikhan has been rebuilding his house and there is still some work to be done to finish it completely. Due to a shortage of money, he has not been replaced the floor, window sills, or wall paper, etc. The main thing he wants to install to his house is electric heating panels to save on the cost of coal and reduce the harmful effects of coal usage. Before, his family used to use a coal-fired stove to warm their home in wintertime.\r\n \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian air pollution.

She is wearing dark brown pants and a brown jacket with orange collar; her purse strap crosses her jacket; and her brown hair is worn down. For 15 years, she has been selling many kinds of new clothing. She works from her house from Monday to Friday, and Saturday and Sunday she manages a vendor stall. Her schedule depends on her availability. She must buy her merchandise in Santiago from stores that offer prices low enough to make her business viable. She will use the loan to buy clothing and accessories such as necklaces, rings, and other items.\r\n\r\nOne of Elsa's goals is to open a boutique in the center of the city where she lives and generate more income to improve her circumstances. She lives with her parents and her 3-year-old son and hopes to open her boutique as soon as possible so that she can help her family financially. She is pleased and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza because it allows her to invest in her business. She has great confidence in and respect for her communal bank; through her training, she has learned accounting practices and new selling strategies.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in center of the country. It is the region's administrative, economic, and cultural center and the most important city in Chile's Central Valley. There is an interesting Chilean phrase, \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\" [Talca, Paris, London], which some say comes from  misstating an English phrase \"Talca looks like London,\" referring to fog

In order to contribute to household expenses along with her husband, she runs a sewing business.\r\nWhen she started the business she had only a basic sewing machine and very few orders. But now thanks to the effort and  hard work she put in, she has enough work for three employees and her financial situation has greatly improved.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Luz Mariela has started her own line of clothing and has received many orders for the clothes from her customers. Because of these orders and because she doesn't have any capital, she is seeking a loan to buy supplies such as fabric and thread so she can complete the orders.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to make a success of her workshop and to be able to provide her six children with a good quality education. As well she hopes that the economic hardships suffered by her family will be overcome by her business success.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1159274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

Displaced from her hometown, she was forced to move with her husband to the city in search of opportunities for their three children. Several years ago, her husband died, leaving her as a single mother of three children and with the sole responsibility of providing for their educational and basic needs. To generate income, Maria sought out someone who could teach her sewing and seamstress skills, so that she could make a living and support her family. After a time, that same teacher helped Maria to open her own sewing workshop, which is now her source of income and helps her to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work and effort, she has increased her customer base and demand for her sewing services, and she hopes that her family's financial situation will continue to improve. While she has high customer demand and a high quantity of orders, she does not have the capital necessary to purchase the raw materials to complete those orders. Therefore, Maria is requesting a loan, which she plans to put towards the purchase of input items, such as fabric, thread and tape for completing customer orders.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand and grow her business, and to eventually create jobs for other people in her workshop. She also wants to continue to work hard so that she can provide for her children and give them a better quality of life, a better education, and one day a stable home in their own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1159275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase input items, such as fabric, thread and tape for completing client orders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-08-13T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-12T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Orfanery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35651},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36646},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37669},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":38720},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":39801},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":40912},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":42054},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":43228},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44435},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45675},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":46950},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":48259}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.39,"local_amount":35651,"processed_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":38289.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433304},{"amount":22.29,"local_amount":37145,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":39893.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617725},{"amount":45.53,"local_amount":75890,"processed_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":81505.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029741},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":80713,"processed_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":86685.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548373},{"amount":0.31,"local_amount":519,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517531},{"amount":162.05,"local_amount":270082,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":290068.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468228051}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T00:21:00Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T10:06:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":458028,"name":"Maria Llaned","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es una madre soltera cabeza de familia de sus 3 hijos y para poder sostener los gastos de su hogar tiene una venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas en la cual trabaja todos los d\u00edas en busca de progresar junto con sus hijos.

This is how at the age of 18 she learned from her aunt how to sell personal use items like lotions, hand cream, hair treatments and other products  thus obtaining a source of income that when she finished high school she was able to use to start paying for her university studies.\r\n\r\nDespite having to make great sacrifices to be able to have her business yield good sales and also attend university and make good grades, Crisleidy has striven hard for the last four years in her business and she hopes thereby to get ahead in life.  She has a large number of customer orders but lacks sufficient capital to fill them so Crisleidy is looking for a loan that will make it possible for her to buy personal use items like lotions, hand cream, hair treatments and other products to be able to fill customer orders.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to continue having this business and that it will make it possible for her to graduate from university in order to get ahead.  In addition, to be able to continue contributing at home so that they can have a better quality of life and better economic opportunities for progress.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1159292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Ceja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-08-13T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-12T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crisleidy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35633},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36631},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":37657},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":38711},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":39795},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40909},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":42055},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":43232},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44443},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45687},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46966},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48281}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.38,"local_amount":35633,"processed_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":38269.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433309},{"amount":22.86,"local_amount":38107,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40926.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617731},{"amount":21.83,"local_amount":36385,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":39077.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640644},{"amount":23.11,"local_amount":38507,"processed_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":41356.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029747},{"amount":24.06,"local_amount":40108,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":43075.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165832},{"amount":24.36,"local_amount":40596,"processed_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":43600.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548378},{"amount":25.87,"local_amount":43112,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46302.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098283},{"amount":25.68,"local_amount":42808,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":45975.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517536},{"amount":26.83,"local_amount":44724,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":48033.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364551771},{"amount":27.37,"local_amount":45612,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":48987.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164186},{"amount":56.65,"local_amount":94408,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101394.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468228052}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T21:59:59Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T10:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":459457,"name":"Qamil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qamil is forty years old.

Because his sales have increased but he does not have sufficient capital to back them up, Luis Alberto is looking for a loan to buy supplies like disposables, sauces and others that he\u2019s been running out of in the business.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to continue growing with his business and someday be able to establish it in a fixed locale to provide better customer service and so that his sales will increase considerably.  He also hopes that his children will be able to have access to a university education and to be able to provide them with economic stability at home.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1159294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-08-13T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-12T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":213904},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":219875},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":226012},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":232321},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":238806},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":245472},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":252324},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":259368},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":266607},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":274050},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":281699},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":289562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":458038,"name":"Isabel Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel es una joven emprendedora que desde hace bastantes a\u00f1os cuando estaba en el colegio comenz\u00f3 vendiendo dulces y galletas para generar sus propios ingresos y poder contribuir en su hogar para que sus padres pudieran gozar de unas mejores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas.
