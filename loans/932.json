Se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijoles desde hace muchos a\u00f1os. Algunas veces tambi\u00e9n realiza trabajos de corta de caf\u00e9, ya que \u00e9l es un hombre trabajador y busca cualquier forma honrada para inyectar efectivo a su econom\u00eda. Su principal fuente de ingresos es la agricultura al igual que para todo campesino. Cada a\u00f1o cultiva la tierra y despu\u00e9s de sacar la cosecha pone  a la venta una parte de la misma. De esta forma es como logra sostener econ\u00f3micamente a su familia ya que \u00e9l  es \u00fanico que aporta a la econom\u00eda del hogar.  Vale la pena mencionar que la agricultura no es un negocio de todo el tiempo, las cosechas de ma\u00edz y frijoles es por temporada y solo se da una vez al a\u00f1o.

He\u2019s worked growing corn and beans for many years.  Sometimes he also works harvesting coffee since he\u2019s a hardworking man who looks for any honest way to earn income.  His main source of income is agriculture like all farmers.  He cultivates the land every year and after taking in his harvest sells part of it.  In this way he\u2019s able to support his family economically since he\u2019s the only one who contributes economically to the home.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that agriculture isn\u2019t a full-time job.  Corn and bean crops are seasonal and are only harvested once a year.

Lilian dropped out of school due to the lack of school fees and her mother's death further compounded the situation.

She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil based on what she needs. She\u2019s been doing this for three years and things are going well. \r\n\r\nPaula started with the money from the first loan she got through the institution.

These businesses provide them the income that they need for their expenses and sustainability.\r\n \r\nAgripina is asking for a loan worth 20,000 PHP since she needs to buy additional fertilizer for her rice field. Moreover, she wants to purchase more merchandise to sell in her store.

She is separated, 45 years old, and has two children who are in school. Due to her separation, she alone is responsible for household expenses. For this reason, she decided to start working with her cousin who had a tire repair business. Despite it being hard work, she performs it in the best way. With time, her cousin left her the business. Little by little, she was buying her own tools until she had a complete workshop where she offers tire service, patches, and second tires. Currently, she has an employee in her charge who helps her with the heavy labor.

He is a very hard-working man who has always been known as honest, responsible, and very happy. He is a man who does everything to make his and his wife\u2019s life better. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 works as a mason and spends most of his time building houses but he also owns a small plot of land. There, he cultivates necessities in the form of staple grains such as beans and rice. He does all this to have a bit of extra salary and to be able to always bring home the daily bread. Besides he also raises livestock which he sells in turn. \r\n\r\nThis way he has some means from where to continue improving his cultivating. But ultimately, he saw the necessity to ask for a loan from INTEGRAL because he has been having problems with the harvest. He needs to buy agricultural ingredients such as insecticides, pesticides and manure among others. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 trusts in God that his harvest will improve. He thanks beforehand for the help that he hopes to receive. Because this is how he will continue to provide the best for his wife. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1159818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural ingredients such as insecticides, pesticides, manure and others. \r\n \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-14T11:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-13T11:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322930431}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T13:16:43Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:46:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mareike Koolen","image":null}},{"id":459738,"name":"Emmalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmalyn is 23 years old, married and has 2 children.

Now he has a plan to work in the mines in the rural areas. He lives with his wife and his parents in a house which is located in the ger district, Mongolian traditional nomadic yurts in the city. \r\n\r\nHis house was built in the early 1990\u2019s and there has not been any big repair or renovation since it\u2019s been built. His house has some problems such as heat loss and damage to its roof, inside walls, etc. so that he is planning to make repairs and insulate by using rock wool, cement and foam. Mr. Batzaya thinks his home will be warmer after the wall and roof insulation and a new smart furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas. The loan Mr. Batzaya is taking will be used to buy some building materials for his home repair.

He lives with his wife and three sons in the ger district, an area with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Living in the ger is quite difficult and cold in the wintertime. Using coal to get warm in their ger is expensive and pollutes the air. Nowadays, air pollution is the one of the biggest issues in Mongolian cities. This summer he started to build a small family house on his land plot behind his ger. The building has not been completed and he is planning to add insulation to the walls of his new house. But due to a money shortage, he still has not bought the insulation materials. It requires foam, cement and additional materials. The loan he is requesting will be used to buy the insulation materials for his new house walls.

He has 14 years\u2019 experience having learned the occupation from his brother.  When he lived in Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, he honed his skills and when he opened his own business in his birthplace, Puerto Colombia, he put them to use.  Erivaldo also worked in his father\u2019s store and this was more commercial experience that helped him when it came time to open his bakery.  He supplies local stores with his production since his business style is to sell to middlemen; he plans, however, to move into a locale where he will be able to sell directly to the final consumer.\r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan is the first financing he\u2019s had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he\u2019ll use it to buy a new display case, a refrigerator, raw materials and supplies to start toward the goal of selling direct to the public that knows him.  His hope for later on is to turn his business into a self-serve and to increase the variety of basic staple items.  While this occurs, Erivaldo works persistently to attain wellbeing for his family which consists of his wife and 14-year-old son.  He has many dreams of prosperity for him framed by his schooling so that he will become a successful

in a rural area located in the Sangke district where crop farming is a common way to make a living, Phally, 51, is a married mother of three children who have their own employment. The source of her family\u2019s income is from farming on a five-hectare area of farmland, where she grows rice, soybean, and cassava. She and her husband have been in this business for several years. The main challenge for her family\u2019s business is the lack of working capital.\r\n\r\nThis is Phally's second loan with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. She successfully used the first loan to relieve her family\u2019s financial burden and increase her family\u2019s income. Now she can earn about 30,000 KHR per day and can save about 15,000 KHR each day for the future. With the need to support her business, she is requesting another loan of 1,000 USD with VisionFund. She will use this loan to buy seeds for her farmland, as well as use a portion of it for land plowing. With this loan, she hopes to increase her crop yields so as to earn more income to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1165412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seeds for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-14T20:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-13T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phally","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118699},{"amount":333,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941000},{"amount":334,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":334,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046428}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T08:34:09Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":459849,"name":"Petronila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petronila, age 52, sells clothes to earn a living.

Estela habita en una urbanizaci\u00f3n caracterizada por combinar perfectamente viviendas familiares, con espacios productivos formales e informales,  con el sector financiero e infraestructuras recreativas muy importantes para su comunidad,  porque son espacios    infantiles y juveniles donde concurren en su tiempo ocioso para practicar actividades l\u00fadicas y deportivas, a rededor de uno de los escenarios deportivos mas importantes del pa\u00eds como el  Estadio Metropolitano, cuna de art\u00edfices del balompi\u00e9 nacional.  Este es el ambiente en el cual Estela y su esposo sue\u00f1an con ver crecer a su hijo de 15 a\u00f1os, como un profesional exitoso y donde ella tiene un taller de confecciones  de ropa con el cual apoya el bienestar de esta familia. Estela fabrica vestidos femeninos, que vende en los almacenes que est\u00e1n ubicados a su alrededor, ropa de jeanes y tambi\u00e9n fabrica los uniformes de varias empresas; aunque la competencia en su entorno es alta, ella se sostiene con la calidad de su producto y con la capacidad de servir, que pone a disposici\u00f3n de sus clientes. Su meta es tener un mayor espacio para su taller, pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr tener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para aumentar su inversi\u00f3n, incrementar su clientela y ganar cada vez m\u00e1s dinero. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1  materias primas al por mayor y de contado, debido a que las ventas se incrementan en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o y ella necesita estar preparada para hacer una buena venta basada en productos a un buen precio y con el dise\u00f1o requerido por la clientela en esta temporada del a\u00f1o.  ","en":"Estela has a lot of experience and has worked as a seamstress since 1990.  She turned that experience into a business in 2000, turning her dreams into a basis for her independence today.  Estela lives in an urban area that combines family homes and both formal and informal work spaces perfectly.  The financial sector and recreational infrastructure are both important to the community because they are spaces where children and teenagers spend their leisure time on sports and play around one of the biggest sports stadiums in the country, the Estadio Metropolitano - the national cradle of soccer.  This is the environment where Estela and her husband dream of seeing their 15-year-old son grow up to be a successful professional and where she has her sewing workshop for making the clothing which supports the family's well-being.  Estela makes dresses that she sells in the local stores, jeans, and also uniforms for various businesses.  Although the competition in her area is steep, she maintains herself with the quality of her product and with her customer service which pleases her customers.  Her goal is to have a bigger space for her workshop but her biggest challenge is to manage to have enough working capital to increase her investment, increase her clientele, and earn more money.  This is why she turned to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, which she will use to buy basic materials at wholesale and cash prices.  Due to the sales increases in the second half of the year, she needs to be prepared to make good sales based on having products at a good price and with the designs her customers want during this season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1160594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Quinind\u00e9 is a small town located on the Ecuadorean coast. The weather in Qinind\u00e9 is tropical and rainy and there are two seasons: dry and rainy. Initially Quinind\u00e9 was only accessible through waterways and by rivers. Recently, at the end of the 1970\u2019s, a highway was built that connected Quito and Esmeraldas, which passes through Quinind\u00e9. The town of Quinind\u00e9 is sustained principally through farming and livestock raising.\r\n\r\nKleber lives in this small place.

She used this knowledge to generate her own, independent income while still being able to keep house. She has done this with her husband's support; he also knew this business from his own experiences. He decided to open the business in their home in another neighbourhood in the city. They had good results there, and gradually progressed. Later they moved to another location where things went much better for them. They were able to save up and buy their home and two lots where they built two apartments because they wanted to keep building capital in order to live a dignified old age and give their children a quality education. Elizabeth has taken out 13 loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo over 16 years. These loans have been a support to her in expanding her working capital. Her goal is to be able to build on their two lots and generate more income in order to keep strengthening their family's position.

","en":"Yonnis is 38 years old and owns a store located south west of the city, where he lives with his wife and their 3 children, ages 6 through 17. He has 4 years experience in running stores but it was just in 2010 that he began his own store, investing little by little and generating more income each day. Initially, he sold products brought from a neighboring country which he distributed among many businesses and families in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nAt present, Yonnis is beginning to sell groceries daily in quantities adjusted to what his clientele can pay, creating a good commercial opportunity. He purchases groceries and meats from the storehouses of ranches, and sells them in his store. These articles are the items most in demand in his store. He sells 80 % for cash and 20 % for credit, between the hours of 6:00 am and 10:00 pm, Monday through Sunday.  His principal customers are residents of the barrio, especially women, who daily carry home the purchases of the day, obtained from Yonnis' store, to prepare meals for their families.\r\n\r\nYonnis' goal is to increase sales, but his major challenge is to obtain sufficient working capital to achieve that. That is why he is presently applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase a larger volume of groceries, soft drinks, liquors, and meals, in order to obtain discounts and diminish transportation costs. The frequency with which, until recently, he has been forced to make purchases, made his expenses higher. With this Kiva loan, he will buy in larger volume and reduce the  frequency of purchases.

She started her business idea in 2002, because she saw a business opportunity in the need that her neighbors had to respond to their communication requests. She first started with a line of cell phones for every phone operator, and gradually her business grew. She currently has 14 computers and lines of various operators, and she sells cell phone recharges and accessories. She's currently applying for her first Kiva loan, which she'll use to purchase cell phones and accessories for selling, because they're products that sell very well and change rapidly. She'll also use her Kiva loan to purchase recharges for selling. Her goal is to exand and diversify her business by adding miscellaneous merchandise until she succeeds in having her own grocery store, where her customers can find everything they need. That way they'll save themselves the transportation money and the extra effort for not finding everything within their reach. Meanwhile, she maintains a sales profit of no less than 15%, and she plans to gradually increase it by buying in bulk and selling fast-changing products, so that she earns a bit more. That is the reason why she firmly believes that with her Kiva loan she'll successfully increase her capital and buy products that are very high-selling in her business
