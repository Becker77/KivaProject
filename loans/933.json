Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house, in the outer ger housing districts of the city. Odgerel\u2019s mother is retired and stays at home, while Odgerel's daughter attends secondary school. \r\n\r\nOdgerel supports her family by operating a clothing retail stall at the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. In 2006, when she first began her business, she sold only leather belts and traditional Mongolian fabric belts. In the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at the present market from another person who had a rental contract with the market. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At the time her stall had 1 million MNT in working capital.

She is a married woman who is 36 years of age. She has a small family comprising four members, including one daughter and one baby son. \n\nIn December 2008, Chitra, along with three other members named Jamuna,Rukmani and Sakuntala of her village, formed a joint liability group (JLG) named Jay Maa Santoshi and took the first loan from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing business. The same group also availed the 2nd term loan from Mahashakti Foundation. During third term loan Chitra was dropped from the group due to her personal problem and a new member named Baidehi joined with other existing three members. In the present term Chitra again rejoined the group and took the leadership. This is the third loan of Chitra from Mahashakti Foundation. Initially, her husband was running a mobile garment shop at the time she took the first loan, used to attend weekly markets of nearby villages to sell clothes. Out of their small income, they are maintaining their family at a low profile. To improve her living condition and to earn some extra income, she took out a second loan and constructed a cabin in her house and started selling ready-made garments. Now she is very much confident in running her business and has developed her clothing shop significantly.\n\nThe other four members of the group are Rukmani, Jamuna and Sakuntala with 4th term loan and  Baidehi with 2nd term loan. They are also running similar types of businesses. Rukmani and Jamuna have their mobile cloth vending unit, Baidehi has a cloth weaving unit, and Sakuntala has a tailoring and dress materials cloth shop. At present, Sakuntala employs three youths to help in her business. \n\nAll members of the group are successfully running their businesses and have been able to repay their previous  loans from Mahashakti Foundation completely and in due time. Due to the successful running of their businesses, the members have been able to increase their income levels, thereby increasing the volume of their business. This enhancement in income level has also helped the group members to possess different household assets for their families. Now they are sufficient enough to educate their children in the school of their locality. \n\nAs per the  estimation and appraisal, the  loan requirement of the group is 156,000 INR."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1153243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for  purchasing of  ready-made garments for sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T11:00:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakuntala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2800,"local_amount":156000,"processed_date":"2015-09-01T07:16:40Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":157029.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731325142}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T03:41:11Z","paid_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":453480,"name":"Dinabandhu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinabandhu is a 47-year-old differently abled person living with his wife and two sons aged 11 and 13 in Odisha, India.

She is going to sell aluminum pots and pans for cooking. \r\n\r\nShe has experience in the utensil business for the last three years as she was helping her brother who sells utensils on a push cart (a mobile utensils shop). Sabitri now wants to utilize those business skills she has acquired and do same business at her home and generate additional revenue for her family and ensure her mother is taken care of as her brother might not be able to support them in the future due to additional responsibilities of his family after his marriage. She needs a loan of 40,000 Indian Rupees (INR) to start her own aluminum utensils business at home. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1160636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to set up her own aluminum utensils business at home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T11:00:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T08:30:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":458761,"name":"Sharat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharat, a differently abled person, aged 30, is married and lives with his wife and three children.

In the city, which is located in the Peruvian jungle, you can see impressive flora and fauna. Its scenery is so beautiful that it makes one disconnect from the noise of the city and appreciate the beauty of nature.  It has a varied cuisine, and it is well known for the amiability of its people.\r\n\r\nIn her free time Rosa really likes to go for walks with her daughter.  Together with her daughter, she also likes to eat one of their favorite dishes, the delicious \u201cceviche [raw fish marinated in lime or lemon juice].\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of effort, and most of all, dedication, Rosa works at a school as an elementary school teacher.  The school is in an area a bit outside of the city.  She works around nine hours a day.  She also has a small business of renting rooms, which gives her another income to use for the household expenses.  She believes it is going well for her in her work and her business because she is very amiable with her students and her customers.  Above all, she works with a great desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nRosa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help they have given her she will be able to make improvements to the rooms that she rents.  She will put down cement floors because the rooms currently have dirt floors, and she will be able to fix up the walls.  This way she will be able to offer better service to the tourists she tends to, and she will be able to improve her income.  This will allow her to continue working and struggling each day to make her biggest dream come true, which is to give her daughter a profession and to be able to have a hotel as a business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1160789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to make improvements to the rooms in her house that she rents.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":131.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":138.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":142.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":149.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":154.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":161.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":169.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":174.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":96.18,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109224},{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":131.11,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":131.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478575},{"amount":53.03,"local_amount":138.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":139.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031264},{"amount":365.09,"local_amount":952.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":958.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482592},{"amount":69.75,"local_amount":181.96,"processed_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":183.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372888690}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T18:21:40Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":460047,"name":"Young Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet with members of the \"Young Women\" group from Makeni, a city in Northern Sierra Leone.

Presently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make plates for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves. A portion of the loan will be utilized by her to buy more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs. \r\n\r\nGouri also wants to buy a buffalo for milking and sell the milk to local hotels and tea stalls. This is the third loan for Gouri and she promises to repay on time. Gouri dreams of building a small concrete house for her family and giving a proper education to her children.

It is located in the district of Rayagada, one of the poorest districts in India.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Laxmi. The lady sitting second from left raising her hand in the photo is Laxmi. She is the Group Leader. She is 26 years old, living with her husband, her daughter aged 7 and her son aged 3. She has been involved in the leaf plate business for the last 15 years. She makes plates woven out of dry leaves at her house and local traders in the village come and collect them every week. She makes 1000-1500 plates in a week. These plates are biodegradable, disposable, hygienic, and an inexpensive alternative to modern paper or plastic utensils. These are widely used by local food stalls and hotels to serve food.\r\n\r\nLaxmi gets the supply of the leaves and bamboo twigs used for stitching from the local sellers in the market and sun-dries them for two days to make them ready to be stitched. Presently, the stock she buys from the local sellers is enough for her to make leaves for one day and sell the next day. She wants to have enough stock to support her business during the monsoon as well when she cannot get dry leaves. A portion of the loan will be utilized by her to buy more stock of leaves and bamboo twigs. \r\n\r\nLaxmi also wants to buy a buffalo for milking and sell the milk to local hotels and tea stalls. She believes her established contacts with hotels and food stalls through her existing business will make it easier for her to sell the milk. This additional income will supplement her income during bad weather times where it might be difficult to dry leaves. Laxmi dreams of building a small concrete house for her family and giving a proper education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of her group are Bhagya, Tulasa and Amika; they are also doing the same business as Laxmi. Since the formation of Ganga, all members of the group have been working hard and continue to work with unity, honesty and sincerity under the leadership of Laxmi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1163533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy more stock of leaves for her leaf plate business and buy a buffalo to start  her milk business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2015-09-01T07:16:40Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":41301.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731325147}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T18:39:16Z","paid_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":459288,"name":"Sri Jagannath Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the year 2010, four women from Bissam Cuttack village of Rayagada district in Odisha, India formed a group named Sri Jagannath (named after a very popular Hindu god in Odisha who they believe looks after them) to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business.

She sells general grocery items like rice, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks (sodas) and stationery such as books, pens, etc.\r\n\r\nRanjita was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her previous loan and increase her cash flow. She has been able to manage her household expenses better and invest in house repairs. She says she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory level with her previous loan. She wants to buy increased stock of items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store. A portion of the loan will be utilized by her to increase her working capital. This will help her to reduce her buying and transportation costs as she will not have to replenish her stock frequently. And her husband will not have to travel frequently to get the stock.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, Ranjita\u2019s shop was displaced due to road expansion. She had to relocate her business to the other side of the road. She says that her previous lady customers are reluctant to cross the road and come to the shop to buy. Ranjita hopes to save enough build permanent premises that will shield her shop from sudden dislocations. Also, she wants it to be in a location close to her house and accessible to her customers, enabling her to divide her time conveniently between household work and running the shop. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Sabita, Gouri, and Janaki and are  running a food stall, a betel nut shop, etc. Since the inception of Sri Jagannath group, Ranjita has been heading the group with dedication and sincerity. The other members of the group are also very happy under the leadership of Ranjita.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1163604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more stock of rice, spices, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":136000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":136000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2475,"local_amount":136000,"processed_date":"2015-09-01T07:16:40Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":136295.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731325148}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T20:56:19Z","paid_date":"2015-11-03T00:10:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":459289,"name":"Maa Majhi Gouri Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group\u2019s name is  \u2018Maa Majhi Gouri\u2019.

Their school was founded in 1994 to educate the children of their community. The school is currently staffed with 10 able teachers and has an enrollment of 371 pupils. This is the first loan that this school has applied for from Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nMartha is the group's leader and headmaster at the school. She is 53 years old and was born in Mabanta village, on the outskirts of Makeni city. She has been in the teaching profession for 36 years now. She is married and has three children who are in college. Martha has requested this loan to pay college fees for her children. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other school employees within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to do with their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay the loan out of their salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1165888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay college fees for her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Martha K.\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":12200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":1220000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-26T08:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1221360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301950067},{"amount":280,"local_amount":1220000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-20T08:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1221360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308848771},{"amount":280,"local_amount":1220000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1221360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315871416},{"amount":280,"local_amount":1220000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T10:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1221360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323744650},{"amount":280,"local_amount":1220000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1221360,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236763},{"amount":560,"local_amount":2440000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2442720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104464},{"amount":554.2,"local_amount":2414750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2417441.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089548},{"amount":285.8,"local_amount":1245250,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1246638.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364821291}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T21:18:47Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:20:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":460071,"name":"Irinea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irinea is a 34-year-old married woman from Bohol, Philippines.

He believes that he does well in his business because he\u2019s very kind to customers.\r\n\r\nJaime is very grateful to Kiva lenders because this is the second time they give him their support and now he\u2019ll be able to buy a shaved ice making machine that will let him provide better customer service and improve his income to continue working toward his greatest dream: to earn enough to sell fish and salt.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1161389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a shaved ice making machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":102.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":106.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":110.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":87.25,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":95.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351569},{"amount":39.24,"local_amount":94.16,"processed_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":102.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109229},{"amount":41.11,"local_amount":98.68,"processed_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":107.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345407},{"amount":42.6,"local_amount":102.22,"processed_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":111.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954617},{"amount":44.49,"local_amount":106.79,"processed_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":116.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089020},{"amount":46.21,"local_amount":110.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478580}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T19:14:20Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":458911,"name":"Jose Bitelio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para poderlo invertir en su negocio, compr\u00e1ndose cerdos peque\u00f1os, para poder mantenerlos en la granja y engordarlos para el comercio, esta compra le ayudar\u00e1 para ganar un margen de ingresos por la venta a futuro.\n\nEl efecto que tuvo con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue favorable, pues le permiti\u00f3 tener buenos ingresos, que hasta el momento le han servido para mantener una condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica m\u00e1s estable con su familia y al mismo tiempo cubrir las necesidades del hogar.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9\u2019s asking for a new loan to invest in his business.

This is the second microloan for Noeurn and the first loan for her co-member with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. \r\n\r\nAfter the first loan was completely paid, she managed to buy an additional plot of land from the revenue received from her crop selling. In the group of two, she is the group leader. Her requested amount is 1,000,000 KHR while her co-member is applying for 500,000 KHR. As for her, she will use her portion to buy fertilizers and to pay for harvesting. Moreover, she is going to buy piglets to raise to make an extra income.

She has long been dreaming of getting involved in some type of business, but had neither means nor support before.  She loved looking after livestock since her childhood.  Zurafo has experience because she helped her parents look after livestock in her father's home.

Its location makes it a link between the various Ecuadorian highways coming from important cities such as Quito, Cuenca, and Esmeraldas. Therefore, it is an important Ecuadorian commercial center; it is home to most of the country's livestock markets.  Here we find a substantial production of cocoa and other agricultural products.  This city has a humid and temperate climate; the temperature varies between 18 and 28 degrees Centigrade. Santo Domingo is home to the Tsachilas, an ethnic group that maintains traditions, such as in clothing and language, that date back prior to the colonial era.  \r\n\r\nJoffre is 42 years old and lives with his wife and their three minor children.  He started a business selling seafood 6 years ago.  He learned this business from some friends, and since he started he has been working several hours per day to make progress with the business.  In spite of his efforts, the income has not been sufficient to provide his family with a decent life.  Therefore, he is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can buy more seafood and reduce the unit costs of his products; this way he can generate better profits.  As a result, he will be able to provide a better future for his children so that they can get the high school education that he could not, and so he can buy the farm that he has been dreaming about."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1158830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more seafood at a lower unit cost to increase his profits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-08-15T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-14T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joffre Douglas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":528,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":48,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390518},{"amount":105.59,"local_amount":101.37,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382639},{"amount":112.83,"local_amount":108.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126132},{"amount":53.53,"local_amount":51.39,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":53.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068593},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":56.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":58.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494866},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":54.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":57.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524795},{"amount":112.56,"local_amount":108.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":112.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133108}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T17:30:32Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":458180,"name":"Johana Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Virgen Del Mar se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en el hermoso balneario de San Mateo en la ciudad de Manta, conocido por sus hermosas playas que son muy visitadas en toda \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o por turistas nacionales y extranjeros, en  este lugar la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes se dedica a la pesca y a las faenas del mar.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Johanna, tiene 31  a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen tres hijos de 10, 7 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad, los mayores estudian en  escuela.

His home is humble.  It\u2019s 35 square meters with metal sheeting walls and roof.  Currently only three of his children attend school.\r\n\r\nSince he was a teen-ager, Miguel has worked in agriculture growing corn in fields of up to 7,000 square meters.

The ones he has now are wood and are greatly deteriorated.  With this investment he will improve his house because by building the roof supports out of cement the house will be more resistant to adversity and have greater durability allowing him in the future to build brick or concrete block walls.\r\n\r\nMiguel aims to build his house little by little.  He states that he always lived in a humble abode with his parents but he wants his children to live in a safer, longer-lasting house.  He thinks that in time and with the financial help he\u2019ll get he will be able to build his dream.  With respect to his family, he states that he will strive so that his children will study through high school with the objective that they will be able to get jobs above day laborers in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1159403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

mother of two children. One of her children is still living with her and supporting the family's business of rice farming.\r\n\r\nSaron has been engaged in her business for 13 years on two and a half hectares of farmland. To add more income, she also raises two pigs at home. The current business earns her about 11,000 Cambodia Riels (KHR) per day. Saron's group consists of two female members; she is a second-time borrower and the other member is a first-time borrower.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches that are visited a lot during all times of the year by national and foreign tourists. In this place the majority of the people make a living fishing and in other sea related trades. \r\n\r\nHere Nacisa lives, whom is 49 years old. She is married and from this relationship she has three children who are already of older and independent. Her husband is a fisherman. \r\n\r\nSeveral years ago she learned the dress making trade in a local academy. She now has a small sewing shop in her house. She makes all types of clothing but what she likes to make the most is women and girls' clothing. During the back to school season she also makes uniforms. Everything that she makes is by orders that her customers make to her and sometimes certain shops in Manta request that she make garments, especially children's clothing, so that they can sell them in their shops. She has had her shop for ten years and she is almost never lacking work. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting another loan since the other was very useful for her because she urgently needed money to buy materials to make school uniforms. With this she also obtained good earnings that served her well since her husband had been sick and she could use these earnings for the doctor and medicine. Now he is better and if it had not been for her earnings she would not have covered these expenses. This new loan is to be used to buy fabrics, thread, buttons and other sewing materials. She has been with the communal bank since its beginning and she likes everything about the bank. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be in very good health.

She is an IDP (Internally Displaced Person) and lives with her husband and five children. She raises fruits and vegetables in her garden. She started this business 10 years ago. She chose this field because fresh fruits and vegetables are very popular in Azerbaijan and people like to eat them fresh and make fresh juices, which is very healthy. \r\n\r\nHer husband is on pension and helps Qanira to sell the crops in the central bazaar.  Her monthly income is 120 AZN. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy.  Many national dishes, like pilau and dolma, are made with vegetables. Fresh fruits serve every table in the Azerbaijan family and also make fresh punch.  Raising crops takes a lot of strength and working in the open air, which is very hard for a woman.
