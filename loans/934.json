At 55 years old she lives alone, as her children are older and she is divorced. She began the business because she wanted to have a means of earning money, but without leaving her house. So it was that the idea came to her and became reality with the help of her children. After some years, and thanks to another loan, she has been able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe works in her store every day from 6 in the morning until 9 at night. Because she lives right there, she doesn\u2019t have any problem with the schedule. In her store, she sells essentials such as rice, sugar, grains, canned goods, cleaning products, snacks, etc. The business also helps with the rent, since she has a space without having to lease. Her greatest fear is becoming ill, because she cannot work when this happens. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to obtain a loan in order to be able to purchase goods \u2013 most of all, sweets and dairy products. She would like to be able to increase her sales and for her business to grow, so that in the future, she can remodel her house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1161822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, sugar, grains, canned goods, cleaning products, and snacks.

The city, along with others nearby on the Pacific coast, was damaged by strong earthquakes in 2001 and 2007, but it has endured, as it has for much of its history.

She has faced enormous problems in her life including the death of her mother and sister, her husband not providing for the educational and health needs of their family, insufficient capital to conduct business and poverty within their family. For these reasons, Evodia Achick joined GHAPE and plans to use her loan to purchase wood for fuel, palm oil, rice, beans, sugar, flour, baking powder and other spices.  \n\nThru her business, Evodia Achick helps the community by providing fast food services for the busy, working urban dwellers. Because of the location of her business, her customers do not need to travel so far for food. She thinks this business will succeed because of its location, the high demand from the growing urban population and her experience in the business. With the business profit this loan will allow for, she will be able to provide for better clothing, health, education and a greater standard of living for her family. She will also be able to improve their housing conditions and reinvest in her business.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1164551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

below the age of 15 years. She and the entire family are living in a two-room apartment house. They are living at New Lay Out, Nkwen, Bamenda, Northwest region of Cameroon.\n\nLots of challenges have been encountered by this lady such as the lack of adequate finances to start up a business and low income within the family, making it difficult to even take care of some basic needs such as education and health bills. Again, she lost her sister who was lending her a helping hand. She also had a motorbike accident and the disappearance of her brother to date. But her situation changed when she joined GHAPE.\n\nShe intends to use this loan in preparing her poultry farm, buying feed for the fowls, buying crates of day-old chicks, feeding trays, fowl vaccines, and drinkers (waterers). \n\nHer loan activity will help the community because it will improve on their nutritional needs, as protein will be on their tables at low and affordable prices. The fowl droppings will be use by women as manure for their farms. \n\nThe venture will be successful because of the high demand for fowl products, that is, chicken and fowl droppings. The profits will be used to cater to her children\u2019s education fees and hospital bills. She also will use the profits to acquire a parcel of land and to plough back into her business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1164592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

He would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

In that regard, she just completed four cycles in this micro-loan program. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge of her business is low capital. This new loan must serve to supply her with 20 hair extensions.

Dilma solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de dos fardos de ropa usada que el ayudaran para poder surtir su negocio de prendas y estilos diferentes que est\u00e9n a la moda y as\u00ed poder llamar la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes. El \u00fanico problema que enfrenta es cuando no tiene dinero comprar fardos de ropa y poder surtir su negocio, se ve en muchas dificultades por lo tanto ella busca el apoyo de FAMA para hacer crecer su negocio. Dilma ha sido cliente de FAMA durante 15 ciclos y ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente.","en":"Dilma is 29 years old, and is a member of the solidarity group, \"Dios Proveer\u00e1\" (God will provide). She is married, has three children, and her husband is a mason. They are a very tight knit, hardworking family, and they live in the community of San Nicol\u00e1s, which is in the city of Juticalpa, Olancho. Dilma makes a living selling used clothing, and began running her small business 16 years ago. She learned the trade from her mother, and presently runs her business out of her home, beginning at 7:00 every morning and working until 6:00 every evening. The advantage of her business is that she has a large customer base and not much competition in her area.\r\n\r\nDilma is requesting this loan in order to purchase packages of used clothing to further stock her business. She hopes, with this investment, to offer a wider range of styles and options to her customers. The only problem she faces is that she does not have enough money to buy the packages of clothing on her own, and she has therefore sought support from FAMA to grow her business. Dilma has been a client of FAMA for 15 business cycles, and has a great history of prompt loan payments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1162009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase packages of used clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-08-16T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-15T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dilma Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dinia Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeny Lizeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":40500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10125},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10125},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10125},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377761},{"amount":525,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10237.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387901},{"amount":499.07,"local_amount":9625,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T09:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9731.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372417},{"amount":550.93,"local_amount":10625,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T10:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10743.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981347}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T18:27:25Z","paid_date":"2012-12-17T10:06:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":460459,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is 26 years old, married, and has two children who are in school.

It's not for a whim that its residents say \"intelligence is endemic.\" However, due to the daily commute of many of its residents, it is referred to as the \"bedroom of the Atlantic,\" as they travel to the city of Barranquilla seeking the better work and education opportunities that are available there.  \r\n\r\nJorge lives in Sabanalarga with his wife and their 2 children, aged 3 and 4.

Also, they are preparing their children for a promising and successful future.  At this time, Jorge is applying for a Kiva loan so that he can add new products to his business, including fast food, hot dogs, sandwiches and other products made from wheat flour.  To do this, he needs a hot dog cart.

de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, desde hace menos de dos a\u00f1os es la propietaria de un caf\u00e9 internet, donde ofrece acceso a las redes, servicio de fotocopiaje, escaneo y llamadas a celulares; su negocio ubicado en el municipio de Galapa, poblaci\u00f3n \u00e1rea metropolitana de la ciudad de  Barranquilla. Billy quiere mejorar la oferta de servicios a sus clientes, pero  aunque cuenta con m\u00f3dulos disponibles, no tiene  computadores para ubicarlos en ese espacio y su clientela muchas veces se va, porque no logra la soluci\u00f3n a sus necesidades de comunicaci\u00f3n en el ciberespacio. Para Billy el insuficiente capital de trabajo para hacer esta inversi\u00f3n es su mayor desaf\u00edo, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 un nuevo computador  y con ello empezar\u00e1 poco a poco  a responder a las necesidades de su clientela.

Billy sue\u00f1a con tener un local mucho m\u00e1s amplio y bien acondicionado, para ofrecer m\u00e1s confort a su clientela, que bien se lo merece y eso es justamente a lo que ella quiere llegar.

His business is located in the municipality of Galapa, a town in the Barranquilla metropolitan area.  \r\n\r\nBilly wants to improve the services he offers customers.  Even though he has available modules, he lacks the computers to put into them and customers often leave because they can\u2019t satisfy their need to connect to cyberspace.  \r\n\r\nFor Billy, insufficient working capital is his greatest challenge and the reason why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy a new computer and start to better respond to customer demand.\r\n\r\nBilly is very hardworking.  The business is open from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.  Purchases are cash and credit in a stationery shop in Barranquilla and sales are strictly cash and depend on how long the customer uses the equipment to access the Internet.  Billy dreams with having a more spacious, well-equipped locale to offer more comfort to customers; it\u2019s something that\u2019s more than deserved and precisely the goal to reach.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1163413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a new computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-16T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-15T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Billy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74501},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82229},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84147},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86111},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88120},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90176},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92280},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94433},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96637},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98892},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101199},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":74501,"processed_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":75665.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775396},{"amount":582.67,"local_amount":1025499,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1041522.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497490}],"funded_date":"2012-08-18T07:38:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":459202,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la Sra.

Now she is requesting a loan with VisionFund of US$1,000. With this loan, she is going to purchase a motorcycle for her children to use to commute to their workplace. She hopes this loan will enable her children to save some time in traveling back and forth to work so they can help with the family\u2019s business and housework.

He has been working as a coffee producer for more than 30 years. The community where he lives does not have basic services; water has to be brought up from a well and there is not potable water. Despite all difficulties Florentino has remained optimistic because he is an expert coffee grower and has obtained very good results from previous loans. Florentino's current project is to build a coffee tree nursery, which will provide him with the trees to plant on his farms as well as allow him to sell trees to other growers in his region. He is also beginning the transition from conventional growing methods to organic farming. Without a loan he would not be able to reach his proposed goals. Last year's harvest brought in 15 tons of coffee and within three years he plans to produce 20 tons.

It is made up of 18 entrepreneurs who make a living in the commerce sector. Specifically, clothing sales, glasswork, bazaars, stores, scarves, perfumes, spiral creams, herbal medicines, hand weaving, and other services.  All of the entrepreneurs are residents of the city of Valparaiso.  \r\n\r\nMargarita, head of the communal bank group, is seen sitting in the first row on the right in the picture above.  She is wearing black pants and has a brown coat while holding a black purse on her legs. She has been making a living in a bazaar stocking crafts, tobacco, garments, and esoteric items for the last three years.  She works Monday through Saturday and sometimes on Sundays when festivals cause more traffic.  Her work schedule is from 10am to 9pm.  \r\n\r\nShe usually purchases her merchandise in Santiago at a low price therefore being economically desirable.  With this loan she will purchase purses, incense, scarves, tobacco, and scarves for her bazaar. Her goals are to continue her business and have the possibility to own a stable spot in order to generate more revenue and this way have a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nMargarita lives with her two children.  One is 23 years old and is preparing to enter military service.  The other is 19 years old and is a student.  Her family goals are to have her own place to live in peace and give her sons the best.  \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity brought to her by Fondo Esperanza as it permits her to invest in her business.  She mentions that the training has been fundamental to her business and to her personal development now that she has learned to organize and distribute her revenues and investments in the best fashion.  \r\n\r\nValparaiso is located 120 kilometers Northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital and also host of the country's legislature.  It is the nation's first port and offers a variety of landmarks both beautiful and picturesque.

She makes a living selling food, which she does every day from a sales post on one of the busiest streets in the city of Cochabamba, preparing and offering her customers a variety of dishes. She says that the work is the main source of income for her and her family, which along with an employee helps prepare the food and tend to customers. She plans to use the loan to purchase wholesale ingredients (potatoes, rice, noodles and other items) so she has a full pantry. Mar\u00eda is a very hard working person who has years of experience selling food and is very grateful for the support being provided to her and her fellow bank members, since many of them are the

He has four children, and their ages are between 11 and 2 years. He has nine successive years in mixed farming, with his farm produce being mainly fruits, vegetables, and poultry.\r\n\r\nBasilio has requested a loan of 45,000 KES from Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, to buy a water tank and irrigation pipes.

I am the only one who has completed my high school education in my family. I run my own business of sending and receiving money. I am very grateful for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nI live in Mazabuka, a town where sugar is produced. There is also fishing as it is very close to the Kafue River. Running my own business is a very good way for me to earn an honest living. Through my business, I get to meet a lot of people in my town. I also get to make some profits, which helps me to support my siblings and my mother back home in Mansa.\r\n\r\nI am taking out a loan so that I can increase my working capital. Right now I have a working capital of about $620. This is not enough because Mazabuka is a town that is growing and people have come to know about my business but I cannot serve them all. I have many incidents where a customer comes and they need to send $650 to a relative, I have no choice but to ask them to use another shop because I do not have enough cash and electronic at my shop. \r\n\r\nMy hopes and dreams are to expand my business. I am very hopeful that the Kiva loan will give my business the boost that it needs. For my personal life, I hope and wish to be a successful businessman and open up more shops in the

In her free time she enjoys taking walks along the warm streets of her city and sometimes cooks some delicious \u201cJuanes\u201d (typical dish of her city) to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith much dedication and thanks to her mother\u2019s teachings, Daysi set up her small food selling business.  She sells such things as:  \u2018cecina\u2019 [dried, cured meat], chorizo, \u2018tacacho\u2019 [smoked, salted pork with mashed plantain] and other dishes typical of her city.  She spends about 10 hours daily in her business and can tend to up to 20 customers.  She feels good doing her work and believes that she does well because her customers seek her out due to her tasty preparations and her kind treatment.\r\n\r\nDaysi is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help provided she will be able to buy supplies like rice, sugar, pork, condiments and bijao leaves, among others.  In this way, Daysi will have the necessary ingredients on hand to prepare her delicious dishes.  With this she hopes to increase sales and income that she want so use so that in the not too distant future she will be able to insure her little ones\u2019 schooling and wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1163991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

He has 30 years\u2019 experience in agricultural work; he raises cattle and pigs.  Santiago learned alongside his brothers because they grew up working as day laborers on a cotton plantation.  Later on they realized that it would be more profitable to work for themselves and since then have been working in agriculture doing their own work.  In order to buy animals, Santiago has to go to a street market and the trip takes forty five minutes each way.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy two calves to fatten up in the pasture and to buy piglets to fatten up in the pigsties he has at home.  Because draught has been affecting the country, Santiago lost 7,000 square meters of corn unfortunately and this is why he wants to buy pigs and cattle to find an alternative source of income.  The loan will help him much to earn more secure income through his animal sales.  His dream is to finish building his house because he still has several things left to do.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1163981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The lines cover a huge area and were used by people from the Nazca culture for agriculture as they form a kind of calendar indicating the rainy season. Because of these majestic lines the town welcomes a large influx of tourists every year.\r\n\r\nMaria is mother to a one-year old whom she loves very much. He is her raisin d'\u00eatre and the greatest gift God has given her. In her free time Maria likes to watch television, but most of all she likes to spend time with her son. Now and again she likes to eat one of favorite dishes, the delicious 'lomo saltado' (stir-fried beef with fried potatoes). Because she is from a poor family, Maria only has a high school education, but she would have liked to go to university.\r\n\r\nEvery day Maria goes to work selling beauty products such as perfume, lotions, and make up. She works about seven hours a day, and might have up to ten customers in that time. She believes that the business is doing well because she is friendly to her customers, but most of all because she is keen to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMaria is very grateful to Kiva donors--thanks to their great help she will be able to buy more merchandise such as perfume, make up, lotions, shampoo, and conditioner.
