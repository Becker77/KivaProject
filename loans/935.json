She is a tenacious woman living in the community of Bijao in the city of Juticalpa, Olancho.  Iris started her business six years ago.  She sells groceries in general.  She started the business on her own initiative and works with one of her daughters.  The grocery store opens at 6am and closes at 9pm.  The advantage is that she uses profits from the grocery store to help support her family.  Iris is asking for this loan to buy products like rice, sugar, lard, juices, milk, candy, soft-drinks and vegetables, among others.

In connection with this, she is asking for a loan in the sums of 2,000,000 KHR to purchase extra farmland. With this purchase, she hopes to have a plentiful harvest each season and thus raise her household income. She thanks all generous lenders for their constant support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1155747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase extra farmland.

She used to work as a housekeeper but the income she was generating there was not enough to cover her household expenses, so she decided to make an effort and set up her own business in order to have better income for her children. That is how she opened her Internet cafe, where she offers her customers great service. This has completely changed her life, as well as her children's. In order to overcome the problems with capital her business is facing, Rosa is looking for a loan to buy a more efficient printer, so that she can offer her customers better service.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a very well-established business that will provide her with an opportunity to provide for her family by offering them a better quality of life in the home. Her other aspiration is to own a house in the future so that she can offer her children a more stable

four children, two of whom are of preschool age.  In search of a source of income for the family, she started her own business in selling food products at a small store in 2009.  Thanks to persistence and hard work, Nurgul was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS).  Successful business development prompted the family to explore new ideas, and the second room in the store was remodeled to become a barbershop and a small business for Nurgul's husband.  In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her merchandise selection by buying an inventory of tea, butter and sugar, which will be bought by local residents in large quantities to make jams and preserves for the winter period.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into an expansion of her retail space and repairing her house in the summer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1168058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

que generalmente era en especie; por esta raz\u00f3n el nombre es alusivo a la metodologia de banca comunal, mujeres apoyando a mujeres.\nEl banco mujer tiene como lider a Ofelia, mujer que se dedica a la actividad de comercio, asi como a la confecci\u00f3n de artesanias y confecci\u00f3n de ropa, esta combinaci\u00f3n de actividades, es el mayor sosten para ella, ya que todos sus hijos ya hicier\u00f3n vida aparte y recibe de ellos un apoyo econ\u00f3mico, que no es lo suficientemente grande, de all\u00ed que ella necesite realizar sus actividades para el complemento de su manutenci\u00f3n.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo se destinara a la compra de mercader\u00eda de cat\u00e1logo, cosm\u00e9ticos, ropa interior, perfumer\u00eda, articulos que tienen una muy buena aceptaci\u00f3n

diferentes temporadas del a\u00f1o, como lo es d\u00eda de la madre, fiestas patrias y fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o,estas promociones son estrictamente de contado.\nEntre los planes a futuro de las integrantes del grupo esta, poder seguir aportando un grano de arena a la econom\u00eda familiar, por vivir en una zona del pa\u00eds con indicadores de empleo, subempleo y desempleo, muy desfavorable para las mujeres, por tener ellas grados bajos de escolaridad y una edad que para muchos empleadores, las consideran inproductivas; de all\u00ed la importancia que este autoempleo tiene para ellas.","en":"The name of this women\u2019s bank, Dorcas, was chosen by the seven group members because it alludes to a woman in the Bible who did work in order to help other women like widows and older people; the help was usually in kind which is why this name alludes to communal bank methodology: women helping women.\n\nThe bank's leader is Ofelia, who works in retail selling crafts and clothing.  This is her main source of income.  Her children are grown and also help her with finances, although not enough to live on.  This is why she runs her own business. \n\nThe loan will be used to buy catalogue merchandise, cosmetics, underwear, perfumery-all items that are well received in their markets because they offer credit to their customers, something that would be impossible if it weren\u2019t for the loans offered by the Fundaci\u00f3n.  In addition, being able to count on having working capital on hand makes it possible for them to take advantage of special sales the suppliers of their products offer during various seasons in the year like Mother\u2019s Day, national festivals, end-of-year festivals.  These special promotional events are strictly cash only.\n\nAmong the group\u2019s future plans is to be able to continue putting in their little grain of sand toward their families\u2019 economy because they live in a part of the city with employment, sub employment and unemployment rates that are very unfavorable for women, because they have low academic levels and are of an age that many employers consider them no longer productive; thus the importance self-employment has for them.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":1157283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

daughter of school age.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 2007 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, Nadezhda was able to develop her business to contain three cows today and have a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS).  Also, Nadezhda is involved in sewing and repairing clothing at home and provides a small income for the family budget.  In order to further develop her business, Nadezhda requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into an expansion of her business and remodel of her

Stephen just opened the doors to his new business Dumping Treasures.  Before starting his own business, Stephen worked for a government run waste management systems for many years.  He saw firsthand how garbage removal companies buried in its depths \u201ctreasures\u201d\/recyclable products that were worth saving.  Through his experience, Stephen came up with the idea for his new business.  Dumping treasures' mission is to donate and\/or recycle whatever is possible from garbage. The goal is to minimize their carting load to keep overhead costs at a minimum while still donating and recycling items that people consider trash that for other's may be treasures. The planned operations will be to purchase multiple dumpsters of various sizes. The dumpsters will be homeowner friendly by having the ability to be placed in areas usually not accessible by trucks. The company also plans to service roofers and concrete workers.   Please help us help this creative business get off the ground!

Since it was built, there has not been any complete renovation to it. In winter, his house has too much heat-loss through its roof.  He uses the coal-fired stove to warm the rooms but this creates harmful smoke in the air all around the city.

She has been teaching for 23 years nonstop and has  had thousands of pupils in that time. She is always proud of her students. \r\n\r\nMrs. Odbaatar lives with her two sons and her husband in a small, old house in the ger district of Mongolian, which is comprised of traditional nomadic yurts, in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Her husband works as a watchman and doesn't earn enough to pay for the family's necessities. Her house was built in the early 1990\u2019s and is not a spacious place to live. In addition to this, Mrs. Odbaatar's house becomes cold and loses heat through the walls in the winter. \r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Odbaatar decided to make insulation for the walls and create an extension by adding one more room to her old house. As she said, \"My house will be warm and comfortable after the renovation.\"  She is asking for a loan for the purposes of making wall insulation and the house extension.

The area has no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity.  She works as a teller in the bank. One of her sons will move out from his parents' house soon and his family has been building a small winter house for him as a wedding gift. Work on the house is nearly 50 percent done, and the family plans to complete it next spring. \r\n\r\nDue to money shortages, however, the family is missing some building materials needed to complete the house. Mrs. Tuya and her husband are planning to build the house walls with insulation, in order to guard against the freezing cold by losing heat through the walls. It is very important to cut fuel usage such as coal in the winter. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition to this, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolians' hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers green loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Mrs. Tuya is taking will be used to buy wall insulation materials for building her son's new family house.

This is the reason why he seeks a Kiva loan with which he will purchase rice, oil, and cereals to improve his business in the hopes of employing a marketable presentation.  He also hopes to increase the amount of inventory he has in stock and impact his sales by increasing the amount of customers served.

She learned the trade from her mother who worked in the Ramada market for more than 20 years and taught her how to do it. Rosario has her own stall and sells breakfasts all day long. She offers tea, coffee, api [a non-alcoholic corn drink] and empanadas. As fate would have it, Rosario is a single mother of four children, but she is brave and works hard to get her children ahead. Three of them are studying in school and one is not yet old enough. She asks for a loan to buy dishes and ingredients like sugar and coffee to make her breakfasts. Her goal is to have a vehicle to move her merchandise and she hopes to see her children become professionals and upstanding people.

Along with the livestock, the family owns a vineyard in which they work hard to get a good harvest. They pick grapes in late summer and sell them to local farmers. Although the family works hard, they still don\u2019t have enough income to save and improve their living conditions.

He learned it when he was very young in his family's shop where he worked for a time until 1977. Then he created his own business by organizing a shop where he still offers items made of wood such as doors, windows, dining room, living room and bedroom sets, sideboards, etc. All of the steps in the carpentery process are done in his shop such as the design, the cutting, sanding, preparation, assembly and carving. He also sells there. He does his purchasing at well known sawmillls located in the same town. His customers are institutions, residents, and freinds from the area. They recommend him to other buyers and are Cristobal's customer base.  His goal is to increase his sales level, outfit his business and repairing his home. At this time, his biggest challenge is getting enough working capital to buy raw materials in greater quantities and be able to save buy buying in high volume. This will make him more competitive. This is the reason he has turned to Kiva for the first loan he has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy wood, paint, glue and materials to make new designs. With this he plans on impacting his customers and making important sales that will add more working capital to his business and increase his earnings.

","en":"Damilde, age 52, sells shoes, clothes, and cosmetics through specialized product guides.  She sells to clientele that she has built little by little since she started her business.   When she started the business she also worked for a company that is very well-known in the area.\r\n\r\nShe started out selling to her colleagues at work, and she was getting more and more customers.  She added a diversity of merchandise to fill the orders her customers made.  She gradually established her clientele, and she added cosmetic sales through catalogs to her everyday clothing sales.\r\n\r\nShe is separated, and she has managed to educate her four children.  They now work at companies, and they help to increase her clientele.  She gives her customers 15 days to pay because her capital turns over quickly.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to locate her business at her house.  She wants to adapt the infrastructure with display cases and displays that have an impact on her sales in a fixed location.  Her biggest challenge now is the she does not have enough working capital to buy clothes and shoes in large volume.  She gets discounts for buying in bulk, and those translate into income and the well-being of her family.  That is exactly what she will manage to do with her Kiva loan.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to invest in the products she has mentioned.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1164864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a greater volume of clothes and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-18T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-17T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":73018},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84389},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":86358},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":88373},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90435},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92545},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":94705},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":96915},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":99176},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":101490},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":103858},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":118738}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":73018,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":75056.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775403},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":84389,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":86745.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387393},{"amount":49.68,"local_amount":86358,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88769.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994220},{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":88373,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":90840.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130576},{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":90435,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":92959.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519442},{"amount":53.24,"local_amount":92545,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":95128.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071281},{"amount":54.47,"local_amount":94705,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":97349.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497497},{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":96915,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":99620.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527314},{"amount":243.47,"local_amount":423262,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":435079.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928089}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T14:19:48Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":461288,"name":"Angie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Angie, 54, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as Cavite, Philippines.

It is also known for the diversity of its gastronomy, especially for one of the typical dishes, the very delicious \"Chupe de Camarones\" (shrimp soup). Antonia is the mother of an 8-year-old boy and together with her husband works very hard to give her son a dignified living and above all, a lot of love, since that is the greatest gift God has given her and the way she moves forward every day. When she has free time, she likes to walk by the river in her city and on occasion she enjoys her favorite dish, which is Chupe de Camarones, with her family. Given her limited economic resources, she could only study through the fifth level of secondary school, but she would have liked to get a university degree.\r\n\r\nShe works very enthusiastically as a farmer. She has planted butter beans and because of this she works around 10 hours a day since she is always on top of caring for the crop. She believes that things are going well for her in her small business because she already has experience and above all she is very careful.\r\n\r\nAntonia is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help that they have given her she will be able to buy compost and fertilizer for her crop, with which she will have a pest-free crop and have a good harvest. This way she will improve her income and be able to keep working and fighting to make her greatest dream a reality: to give her son a good

This family lives in a simple home they own, it's built in a community in the central jungle.  He has been working in agriculture for 15 years, he has 3 plots of land where he harvests; coffee, annatto, oranges and cassava, the last few are for his own consumption.  \" The coffee and annatto are the most viable, which is why I spend more time cleaning those plots.\", states Mario.  This past year he yielded 1800 Kilograms of coffee grain which fill about 30 sacks of 60 Kilograms each.  It is a good yield considering the size of his land.  He also harvested 1500 Kilograms of annatto.  He is able to sell his crops immediately thanks to the contacts he's made from many years in the industry.  He now wishes to have another plot of land, and to achieve it he will continue to work and purchase another plot.\r\n\r\nThis is his 3rd loan with MFP and he committs to paying on time.

He hopes he will be able to generate enough income and establish a farm of seven dairy cows within five years. He says the diversification will help improve his farming income, which is usually challenged with seasonal fluctuation in maize prices. He adds that the income will help him a great deal in educating his children.\r\n\r\nTimothy is, however, concerned with poor road networks, which make access to other markets expensive.

Both were born in the zone and have only a primary school education. \r\n\r\nThey need operating capital to buy forage (soy bean hulls) to feed their cattle. This is the season when cattle-raisers store feed for the rest of the year.

They live in the house of his in-laws. \r\n\r\nEfrain wants to purchase land and thus be able to construct a dwelling, since currently, his family only has 2 rooms.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSegunda is a mineral water distributor. She buys mineral water in containers from wholesalers and then sells it by the container (5 gallons per container) for a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 13,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more stocks of mineral water to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSegunda dreams of expanding her business and hopes to give a good future to her children through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have a growing network of customers.

He has seven children.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services, and a job salary.   He has requested a loan to buy a dairy cow.  He has been doing this work for 20 years. \r\n\r\nWilliam was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan.  He said the product offered -- the dairy cow -- was what he wanted.  William was also asked what he learned during his microfinance training session: \"How to manage the loan and farming as a business.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?,\" William replied that from the dairy cow, he will sell milk and thus increase his income; the cow will also give him a calf, thus his assets will increase.\r\n\r\nWilliam also stated what is most enjoyable about farming - \"being able to get milk and being his own boss!\"  His biggest challenge is difficulties in transportation. His highest monthly expense is school fees.  The animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Chepsitie, cheborus.\"\r\n\r\n*****For this profile template, Juhudi Kilimo is making microfinance more efficient by gathering information using

Eduard en su negocio vende a almacenes y a particulares, tiene clientes fijos a los cuales les otorga cr\u00e9ditos y tambi\u00e9n le pagan de contado, \u00e9l est\u00e1 muy pendiente de las exhibiciones, ferias, mercados abiertos que hay en Bogot\u00e1 para participar y darse a conocer, porque sus expectativas de crecimiento no tienen l\u00edmites aunque va avanzando gradualmente, pero conpaso firme. ","en":"When Eduard started his business, he slowly and carefully bought each machine and part needed to equip his small leather goods shop. Today the business generates income to support his household, which comprises his wife and 4-year-old son. At 39, he has maintained his income source and dreams of prosperity for his micro business, which is the entity that provides for his family's welfare. His main goal is to fully establish his business in a commercial space on the east side, but he lacks sufficient working capital to make several investments at the same time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is requesting another Kiva loan, which will be his second loan cycle with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy wholesale supplies and create new designs that will impress his customers and increase sales. The previous loan increased his working capital as well as his customer base, so he is very enthusiastic and continues to dream of prosperity. Eduard sells to department stores and individuals; he has loyal customers to whom he extends credit and others that pay cash. He is looking forward to participating and getting recognition at the exhibitions, fairs, and open markets in Bogot\u00e1. He believes his potential is unlimited, and though growth may be slow, it will be steady."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1165007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale supplies and create new designs.

years old, and her daughter Catalina, who is thirty-three. For the past eight years, Romelia has made a living making and selling tortillas in her home. Romelia sells at both meal times every day.

In years to come, she plans to save some of the profit to purchase extra land to increase the volume of her rice production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1158476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to purchase farm supplies such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides used on her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-08-19T00:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-18T00:40:01Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sorm","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301422238},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182608},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315413885},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T09:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323019192},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155466},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T11:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540468},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090634},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355834922},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364543754},{"amount":15,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-26T08:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":60930,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372942429}],"funded_date":"2012-08-19T02:35:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-26T08:56:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":461435,"name":"Jovie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovie is from the village of Maligaya.

There, he sells a variety of merchandise. Early everyday he goes out on the streets of the city, selling mops, brooms, buckets, pots and general small electrical appliances. His experience in this business goes back to his adolescence, in the streets of Cartago, a municipality in the department of Valle del Cauca, where he would accompany his father to buy the items to sell street by street in Cali, a beautiful city where salsa music is breathed in every corner of the city. When Jose was old enough to do it, and moved to Cartagena, he started the same business there, with the aim of generating income that would permit him to support his family. His dream is to have his own local where he could set up his business and not wander the streets with all of his merchandise in order to manage to sell it, under the harsh Caribbean sun of this breezy beach town. His biggest goal is to achieve the capitalization of his business and to set up his store in a strategic spot to increase his sales. This is the reason why he is turning to a Kiva loan, the first funding that he will get from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which he will buy household items and small electrical appliances that his customers have pre-ordered. Jose persistently works because, as a good farther, he dreams of seeing his kids turn into successful people and of building a promising future for them. Therefore, he puts all of his efforts into achieving this through his work.

The average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a seven-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nGulo requested a loan from Credo to start livestock farming. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Gulo will purchase calves.
