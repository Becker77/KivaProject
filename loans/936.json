Sharon is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kacwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Sharon has been working hard to manage her little retail shop, where she sells household goods and basic foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sharon has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to expand her inventory by purchasing goods like soap, eggs and salt to sell, and will help Sharon to generate greater profits and pay medical expenses and save money. Sharon hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nSharon is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1169533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has to work hard to provide food for himself. He has worked in agriculture his entire life, and it is also worth mentioning that this is his main source of income. He is a tireless man who, despite his age, doesn't stop working hard and hoping for a different quality of life. Year after year, he asks God to help him with the new harvest since agriculture is very vulnerable to climate change. In this case, the harvest often does not withstand these changes and the desired harvest is not achieved. This is what happened to the previous harvest since the rains didn't allow for an abundant harvest. This situation kept Antol\u00edn from staying caught up with his loan, so it was canceled. Therefore, he is now requesting refinancing through INTEGRAL so he can buy the necessary supplies for the new harvest, which he hopes will be abundant.

They also have a plot of land where they grow maize. George sells cheese and maize in nearby villages. The average monthly income of the family is 202 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a four-person family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"vulnerable poor\" category: they get the above-mentioned monthly social assistance from the government because they are estimated to live below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start a new type of business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they as regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d on account of their low income. With the loan, George plans to purchase a truck. He will start trading in scrap iron. He will purchase scrap iron from local population, organize transportation, and sell it using his own truck. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

He cultivates staple grains, especially corn and beans.  He has a lot of experience in agriculture because he learned to farm at a very young age.  He always puts his best efforts into the harvests, and he gets good results.  He cultivates land that is located in an accessible area that is suitable for cultivating and has fertile soil. He sells everything he produces in the areas surrounding his community, and he already has lots of customers.  They seek him out because everything he sells is top quality and at affordable prices, and he also provides good service. \r\n\r\nPedro is a young businessman who is energetic and responsible.  What is most important to him is his family.  He wants to achieve success, and he believes that the most satisfying goal is reached by taking the path that is longest and requires the most effort.  \r\n\r\nIn his last harvest, Pedro suffered some losses due to the weather.

She lives in the Tskaltubo District with her husband Badri and their two sons (17 and 22 years old).  The younger son attends the village school and the elder works in construction.  Rusudan and Badri run a small-scale agricultural business, which, along with the elder son\u2019s salary, is the family\u2019s source of income.  They earn an average total of 400 Laris a month.

According to Credo\u2019s estimate, the family falls into the \u201cvulnerable poor\u201d category. \r\n\t\r\nRusudan and Badri have 2 milking cows, and also produce cheese. Part of the cheese is consumed by the family and the rest is sold in the village. Rusudan has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start another agricultural business, but without any success.  Her loan requests were always rejected because of her family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nRusudan then requested a loan from Credo to start a new business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan Rusudan will purchase a tractor to provide seasonal agricultural services to local farmers, for which she will charge a service fee.  This new business initiative will double the family\u2019s income and enable them to improve their living

She is a hard working person who is responsible and very well known in the area for her big heart and friendliness toward others.\r\n\r\nKhatia is asking for a loan to buy herbicide and insecticide to apply to her citrus garden.

Her partner is Oscar, 40, and they have three children. They live together in the house they bought approximately 15 years ago. She sells agricultural supplies such as manure, fertilizers, sprayer backpacks, and other products. \r\n\r\nShe has had a shop set up in the first floor of her home for more than three years. She has the support of her husband, who takes care of the heavy part of the work. \r\n\r\nFor Adela, this work is very profitable, as she always has income from the farmers who acquire their products to improve their plots of land. \r\n\r\nShe is also aware that at times she has problems, because she runs out of the sacks of manure, or another of the most needed fertilizers. That is when she turns to the loans. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She feels very happy to be able to count on this financial support and once again, she promises to to be on time with her payments. She will continue being a member of her communal bank, because she enjoys the meetings they have.  \r\n\r\nWith these 4,000 nuevos soles she will buy more bags of manure and containers of fertilizer for stocking her business.

He lives in the city of Pucallpa with his wife and their two children, whom he loves and who are his main reason for living. He is a very friendly, hard-working, and enthusiastic person. Together with his wife, he puts all his effort into helping his family get ahead. Unfortunately, due to the need to work and provide for their living expenses, he was not able to study Mechanical Engineering, as he had hoped to do, and would have enjoyed very much if he had been able to do it. In his free time, he likes to work in his garden. Sometimes, he cooks up a delicious pot of turtle soup to share with his family.\r\nThanks to his father\u2019s help, and with lots of determination and enthusiasm, Minor started his small business repairing and maintaining vehicles and heavy machinery. He has a workshop where he offers his services. He starts working early in the morning every day, and works approximately twelve hours a day. He believes that his business is going well because of his dedication and the friendly treatment he provides his customers.\r\nMinor is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have provided him, he will be able to finish building his home. He will build a wall in the back part of his house, and will be able to lay a concrete floor throughout his home. In this way, Minor will have his home better equipped to be able to provide more well-being and safety to his family. As a result, he will continue working and striving so that he and his family will be able to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1165833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Wilfredo is 45 years old, with a good credit history. He makes polyethylene bags which, depending on his customers' orders, are used to hold various amounts of liquids. Wilfredo is a hard-working man who has lots of experience. He started his business twenty years ago. In order to produce polyethylene bags he had to furnish his workshop with all the necessary equipment, such as an extruder and sealers of all sizes. Wilfredo has done this with the help of his family, who is always by his side. Wilfredo has lived in the Achachicala district for a long time. It is worth noting that once Don Wilfredo finishes repaying this loan he hopes to take out larger loans. With the loan money he will purchase raw materials to make bags, such as polypropylene. Wilfredo is a very enterprising person, who, in time, hopes to be able to sell his products to the different supermarkets in the city of La Paz and throughout Bolivia. He is very grateful for the opportunity he has been offered as a result of receiving this loan, which will help him to improve his business.

She was a seamstress by trade and always taking care that her granddaughters learned the art of sewing. She would put them beside her when she did her tasks. That is how Rocio learned empirically how to cut fabrics and express herself in them with the styles she had in mind. Since Rocio was the only one of the granddaughters who advanced in sewing, she ended up being her grandmother's partner. When her grandmother started having health problems. she gave Rocio the sewing machines, the overstich machine and her work tools. She uses these to work in her own sewing workshop where she makes clothes for women, men and children. She generates income to support the wellbeing of her 2 year old son. She dreams of seeing him become a person with a succesful career. At 27 years old and with 4 years with this business, she plans her day to day growth. She doesn'y have enough working capital to achieve her goal quickly. That is why she is turning now to a Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will invest in buying various fabrics, raw materials and more to be able to produce clothes of all prices and thus obtain more earnings for her products and contribute much more to the household expenses. That is why she works so persistently to improve her operational performance and offer high quality products.

He usually goes to work in the provinces around the country and visits home just a few times a month. \r\n\r\nTo add to her husband\u2019s income, Chorn dedicates herself to selling different kinds of desserts in the vicinity of a garment factory where many workers eat breakfast and lunch.

insuficiente para lograr ampliar su cobertura de clientes en el mercado. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 art\u00edculos para el hogar y de aseo personal, productos de una mayor rotaci\u00f3n y que coprados en mayor volumen incrementan las utilidades del negocio de Edgar.

He decided, on his family\u2019s suggestion, to start a business, which he began with caution, but little by little he was able to find a great opportunity to generate an income.  Things have gone well for him.  He has strengthened his autonomy and so he plans to put all his efforts into making it grow, however Edgar has a great investment challenge and his working capital is insufficient to be able to expand his coverage to his clients in the market.  This is why he has requested a Kiva loan.  It will be his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy household and personal items.  These items sell well and buying them in quantity increases Edgar\u2019s business\u2019 profit.  His goal for the future is to become one of the largest distributors of these products and he will certainly achieve it because he is disciplined and has the ability that he needs to be successful and ensure his family\u2019s

","en":"Walter is 20 years old and the father of a 2-year-old son. He is an inspired young artist who paints pictures on canvas. He sends them to a framing shop and sells them. He has had business experience since he was 15, when he learned to profit from the products of his inspiration and make it his own lifestyle that would generate income for him. His principal customers are homemakers and employees who pay him weekly, monthly, or every two weeks, according to each one's ability, but in the short term. Now he does not have access to clients with whom he could negotiate if he offered longer term loans, and this has become one of his greatest challenges. This is why he is turning to a Kiva loan, which will be the second financing that he has had with Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and with which he will buy frames, canvases, and paint in greater quantities, in order to offer better payment terms to his customers and win a larger number of them. Walter is a hard-working young man who goes out every day with his paintings and offers them door-to-door throughout the the city of Cartagena, always seeking to sell more each time. His goal is to end the year with an increase in his loan portfolio and succeed in responding to all the challenges that entrepreneurial activity brings with it, since he is very young and has the ability to achieve his dream of prosperity, which is nothing other than improving his quality of life and that of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1166100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

He lives alone in a rustic house that he built near his fields in an indigenous community in the central forest. He is a happy and charismatic young man who has supported himself since he was 20 years old by cultivating the lands his family gave him. There he produces citrus (oranges, mandarins, limes) and bananas. He is doing well. He can earn an income every 15 days from his banana harvests and once a year from his citrus crop. Thanks to his skill, he sells his products satisfactorily in the fruit market in the city.\r\n\r\nAside from farming, Danyoon has a pastime that he also considers a job: music.

She is married with four children. She is an IDP and lives with her family in an IDP settlement. She is an animal breeder and fattens sheep. She has more than 10 years of experience, which makes her an experienced person. She has gained trust and respect from the local butchers and local vendors.\n\nShe usually buys lambs, raises them and fattens them, and in 4-5 months, she sells them for a more profitable price at the local livestock bazaar.  People in Azerbaijan use mutton in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolmas, and always use yoghurt sauce. Mutton is considered very healthy and also present in everyday life. Fur is very useful for blankets and bed mattresses, which are made by local women.

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and they also make fresh punch. Her monthly income is 120 AZN. Raising crops takes a lot of strength and, working in the open air, is very hard for a woman. That why her spouse helps. \r\n\r\nSafura needs additional capital to invest in seeds and fertilizers as well as new garden tools. This will allow her to improve the quality of products she raisea and to increase her monthly turnover. For this purpose she has applied for 1500 AZN.

He is married and a father to one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Haitham has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family. Haitham is requesting a USD youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of licensing and insuring the taxi and purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Haitham to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nHaitham is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees.

is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Kamal appears in her Kiva profile photo. Ansam is 30 years old and the mother of three daughters. For the past two years, Ansam's husband has earned a living by running a grocery store.  It has been profitable, but the only source of income for the family and it does not bring in enough money to cover the family's costs. Ansam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband buy more groceries to sell, including rice, sugar and  milk. This will increase sales and the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is its prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit into this cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The loan amount you see here includes both the loan principal loan and the servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"\r\nOscar, 30, is single and has no children.  He lives in the Bel\u00e9n neighborhood in the city of Juticalpa, Olancho Department.  He started his barber shop five years ago and still works in the same occupation but also sells new clothes.  He learned his occupation working in a barber shop and decided to open his own.  He works alone from 8am until 7pm.  One of his advantages is that he has many customers but his disadvantage is that he has to pay rent.\r\n\r\nThe loan Oscar\u2019s requesting is to buy new shirts and tools he needs in the barber shop.  With help from this loan he will be able to equip his business with everything needed to provide more efficient customer service.  His dream is to have a locale of his own and to build his house.  Oscar has had two loans with FAMA and has been a client who has made his installment payments punctually.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1166500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

She lives alone in her own house that she built with her husband when she was young.\r\n\r\nShe is a sweet woman who is very dedicated.  Her age is no impediment for her to devote herself to a very tiring activity: agriculture.  The soil in her area is apt for pea, potato, corn and some vegetables so she takes maximum advantage of each season to produce.  \u201cI like my work because I feel free walking along the canyons and mountains with my animals and caring for my crops,\u201c she says.  She takes advantage of her time from the first glimmers of dawn; it\u2019s the only way she can be sure to care for all her crops.  What she dislikes is that sometimes they become infested with pests and she remember sadly how once she lost almost her entire crop but with experience she continues to work.  She just finished harvesting corn a month ago and now has space available to plant peas which she\u2019ll do this month.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \u201cLindo Amanecer de Cumutay\u201d (Beautiful Cumutay Dawn) and she likes the way her group works.  This would be MFP loan #11 for her and she is very grateful for the trust placed in her for so long; she\u2019s been with this institution more than 5 years.  She will use the money from this loan to buy a sack of pea seeds (600 soles) and will use the rest for any other expense that might arise relating to her fields.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1166947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sack of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-20T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-19T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":850.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572153}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T23:08:01Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":462009,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 41 years old.

Her husband's name is Cesar: he is the father of both her sons, who are sixteen and nine years old. Gemima's business is selling fresh fish. She starts work very early in the morning at the fishing docks, where she buys fish that she then sells retail in the very same harbour. As a street vendor, she has a loudspeaker to attract people's attention. Her first business was selling sweets and candy, but thanks to what she earned with it and a loan with field partner MFP, she was able to start selling fish. She has been doing this for five years and her husband helps her. She considers it a profitable business because she can earn an income working only for half of the day. She dedicates the other half to taking care of her family.

In the morning, she sets up a table in the front of her house, where she serves her customers. She also has another business, selling beauty products by catalog. She sells them among her friends and family. She started the fruit selling business with a loan from MFP and so far she has been doing it on her own. She considers it to be profitable because of the earnings she gets and for being the only one in her neighborhood. Before she started, she wanted to to be a productive person and generate an income of her own, so she didn't have to depend completely on her partner and to be able to support him with the household expenses. Therefore, seeing the results, she wishes to go on and invest in another business, like a groceries store in her house. This is her 4th loan with MFP and she is happy to know that she will continue to get the financial support she needs to materialize her plans.
