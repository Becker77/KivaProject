They have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for a loan of 500,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for each in the group. With the help of this loan, each of them will be able to add more inventory to her respective business.\r\n\r\nA business with a large inventory can naturally attract many customers and this will lead to more sales and better profit. In addition to this, the larger the inventory, the fewer business trips these women will make. So, profit will naturally increase, empowering them to better support their children in terms of feeding, clothing, education, etc. \r\n\r\nThe featured member for this group is Messie. A native of Kenema city, Messie is 32 years old. She is married to a trader and she is a mother of 3 children - one in primary school and two in secondary school.

This group of dedicated and hard-working women have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone to request a loan of 2,600,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for the entire group from Kiva lenders. With the help of this loan, they can improve on the size and quality of their respective businesses. \r\n\r\nA business with a lot of inventory is naturally attractive to many customers. In addition to attracting many customers, the number of business trips that these women will make is reduced because of the large inventory in their stalls. An increase in inventory and a reduction on business trips will enhance profits for these women, hence they have come to apply for this loan. \r\n\r\nMassah is the featured member for this group. A native of Kenema city, the 29-year-old is married to a trader and the couple has 2 children attending primary and secondary schools. Massah sells clothes and has been doing this kind of business for many years now. She will use her share of this loan to buy a larger quantity and wide variety of clothes to add to her current ones.

is 56 years old and from Panglao, Bohol. She is married with children who are mostly adults. Daniela has been in the business of hog raising for two years now. She is asking for a loan to buy quality hog feed and new piglets to raise to increase her income. This is her family's livelihood and helps to support the needs of her family.

is a 50-year-old clergy member. He is married and has two kids. In 2003, Knox established a social welfare group out of the need to offer financial literacy and solutions to his congregation, which is composed of rural disadvantaged families. Through this social welfare group, Knox would arrange for seminars and field days through which his congregation would be trained on how to save and on good farming practices. The same members would also pool their savings together and offer some short-term loans to some of their members to repay with a small amount of interest. \n\nIn 2005, Knox registered his group as a microfinance and consulting institution named Rural Economic Empowerment Programme (REEP). He hoped to mobilise savings from the church members and advance loans to the less fortunate in the church by facilitating them to pay school fees, buy farm inputs, buy water harvesting tanks and improve their general living standards. REEP grew within a few years and Knox recruited members from other denominations and also expanded to other towns because of the good advocacy the institution was getting through its members. Today, REEP has enrolled over 400 groups and has a network presence in central, eastern, and coastal Kenya. \n\nIn response to the high cost of kerosene for lighting the members' households, REEP introduced solar lanterns from BrazAfric to its members by financing the members to buy these solar lamps. The demand for the solar lamps soon became too high, so REEP, due to limited cash flow, could not buy an adequate supply of solar lamps to meet the high demand. Knox has been enjoying some credit terms to pay for the lamps in 30 days. He is now seeking to purchase solar lamps worth $2,000 for his members through Kiva financing. \n\nOn the uploaded photo is Knox with Sera- a member of one of his group called St Anne's Self help group in Voi, who purchased a solar lantern on loan from REEP. She has since finished repaying for the solar lamp and no longer has to spend so much money on buying Kerosene but rather she is happy that she can save now some extra money for food and school fees.   \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1164582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to pay for solar lanterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Knox ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088221},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339477882},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347030660},{"amount":666.66,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775275},{"amount":333.35,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482227}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T10:37:17Z","paid_date":"2013-09-19T08:41:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":462293,"name":"Hiep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hiep is requesting a new loan to expand her business by buying more clothes from different suppliers to satisfy her customers.

He is married and has one child, aged 12 years old. He has one additional dependent living with him.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Daramy established his tailoring business. He began his business because he wanted to improve himself and his family. Working six days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of Le 5,000,000.

For the past 6 months, Goreti has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells second-hand clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Goreti has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to expand her range of used clothing to sell and will help Goreti to generate greater profits and pay school fees. Goreti hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nGoreti is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The loan will be used to buy goods like soap and bread to sell, and it will help Christine to generate greater profits, pay medical expenses and save and budget. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Her growth plan starts with the purchase of supplies in larger amounts in order to qualify for volume purchase discounts which translate into higher profits and good customer service so that her business will function in a comfortable environment.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing she gets from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy supplies for her daily work.  \r\nShe will also invest in making improvements to her business with the purchase of work tools to improve the quality of her service; this is what her loan\u2019s success resides in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1167698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy manicure and pedicure supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65395},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74699},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76442},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78225},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80050},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81918},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83830},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85786},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87787},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89836},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91932},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":65395,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67307.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775419},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":67572,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":69548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130590},{"amount":36.43,"local_amount":63348,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65200.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497511},{"amount":462.12,"local_amount":803685,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":827192.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928102}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T19:46:47Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":460803,"name":"Cleotilde","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cleotilde invirti\u00f3 su credikiva en dos partes, por un lado compr\u00f3 materias primas con los cuales fabric\u00f3 bolos y por otro lado invirti\u00f3 en el cultivo del campo; Su meta es continuar tecnificando su infraestructura y tener   maquinaria industrial y construir un deposito donde provisionarse de agua.

","en":"Minerva, 48, is the mother of three children whose ages range from 12 to 30.  She\u2019s owned a sewing business that operates at home for the last 18 years.  Her business was born when she used to work as a domestic employee and learned from her employer during two years.  When she got the opportunity, Minerva took courses at SENA [National Occupational Learning Center] and when she finished her course work decided to gradually set up a workshop that would allow her to work from home while caring for her children.\r\n\r\nShe currently sews for schools, students, independent workers and teachers; her focus is industrial clothing.  Minerva is currently manufacturing student outfits, sports uniforms and women\u2019s clothes primarily.  Her sales are primarily cash and her purchases in specialized sewing supply warehouses in the city of Cartagena are too.  Sometimes she travels to the city of Barranquilla to have more varied options in accessories.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy fabric and thread and will also do some physical upgrades to her shop because she wants to increase sales since she has growth potential in the marketplace that she\u2019s not yet explored which is precisely what will make the investment of her loan successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1167736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing supplies and to do physical upgrades to her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minerva Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56483},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62001},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":63448},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64928},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66443},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67993},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":69580},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71203},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77921}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.95,"local_amount":56483,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":58977.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775421},{"amount":36.17,"local_amount":62001,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":64739.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387409},{"amount":37.01,"local_amount":63448,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":66250.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994237},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":64928,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67795.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130592},{"amount":38.76,"local_amount":66443,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69377.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519456},{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":67993,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70996.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071295},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":69580,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":72653.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497513},{"amount":86.99,"local_amount":149124,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":155710.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527327}],"funded_date":"2012-08-22T02:41:58Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":460640,"name":"Nabela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nabela is a 32-year-old young woman.

She wants to expand the business but lacks capital to back her up which is why she\u2019s asking INTEGRAL for a loan to buy tomatoes, chilies, onions, avocadoes, bananas, etc.  Ana Elizabeth has good credit history and is sure that she will be able to repay the loan in the established time frame while at the same time is confident that she will be able to give her family better quality of life.\r\n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1167777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.82,"local_amount":70.82,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330250},{"amount":34.77,"local_amount":34.77,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":34.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349982},{"amount":38.97,"local_amount":38.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":38.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321346},{"amount":9.36,"local_amount":9.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846156},{"amount":54.87,"local_amount":54.87,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004065},{"amount":43.95,"local_amount":43.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":43.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447486},{"amount":47.8,"local_amount":47.8,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":47.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450668},{"amount":48.99,"local_amount":48.99,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":48.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373081882},{"amount":53.51,"local_amount":53.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":53.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382264788},{"amount":96.96,"local_amount":96.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390739434}],"funded_date":"2012-08-23T00:53:00Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:31:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":460647,"name":"Ahed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahed is a 41-year-old man who is married and a father to one son.

For a number of reasons, she sadly separated from her partner, and now she is both mother and father to her child. Despite her youth, she is a very happy, hardworking, and enthusiastic person with a great desire to get ahead. She completed secondary school through her concerted efforts. Because she had to work and earn money to pay expenses, she could not pursue the business administration degree she so desired, though some day she would like to do so. In her free time, she likes to teach her daughter how to dance, and sometimes she prepares the delicious traditional pasta dish \"tallarines rojos\" to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith dedication and enthusiasm, Esthefany started her small business selling cosmetics and perfumes. She begins selling early each morning from a small case where she displays her products, and she also takes catalog orders.

is divorced and has 4 children.

To earn a daily living, she has been raising pigs for more than four years. This is the main source of income, and her husband supplements the family's income as a fisherman. The current business earns her about 22,000 KHR. For the four loan cycles that she has been with Kiva partner VisionFund, she has paid back all the loans with success, maintaining a better standard of living for her family. Now, she has formed a group of three female members to seek a new loan and she is the group leader.

From the current business, they can earn about 30,000 KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. Channy has been with VisionFund for three cycles while the other member has been with VisionFund for one cycle. The past loans have helped her relieve her family\u2019s burden and enabled her to buy a motorbike to support her business. Now, she is leading the group of two to request a new loan. As the leader, Channy is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer and seed for her farmland and use a portion of it to pay for labor costs in plowing. She hopes her crop yield will become more profitable so as to increase her income to make a better living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1171662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

where crop farming is a common way to earn a living. She is married with five children, only two of whom are dependents and still in school. She and her husband are peasants who grow rice and red maize as a primary business, and she also sells dessert in the local area to earn more income. The current business earns her about 10,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan for Sokhhom's group with Kiva's partner VisionFund. She and another member have been with VisionFund for one loan cycle, while the other member has been with VisionFund for five loan cycles already.

To get the family out of hardship, she has to work on one hectare of rice farm in a local area whilst her husband travels to Phnom Penh (Capital City of Cambodia) to work as a construction worker to make additional income to better support the family. Vanna has been engaged in this rice farming business for 26 years. For her, the main challenges are the declining price of the rice crop and the high cost of fertilizers, which affects her income. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these difficulties, she is applying for a new loan with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, as a first-time borrower. Vanna will use this loan to buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland. She will also use a portion of it to support her married child who is in a difficult situation of lacking finance to set up a barber shop to make money as a supplemental income to keep their children

The investment will allow her to fill orders that she has already received, orders for merchandise such as women's and children's shoes.  She asked us to pass along a message to Kiva lenders: \"I am grateful to have found an organiation that helps small businesses like mine get ahead, not only with financial help, but with training too\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1168441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
