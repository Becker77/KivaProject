She is an entrepreneur from Novaya Kahovka.  She sells women's knitted clothing at one of the local markets.  She leases her retail space land from the market administration, but owns her kiosk.  Valentina has been in this business for 17 years.

This is not the first loan that she is obtaining from Kiva.  She invested her previous loan into a purchase of an additional inventory of merchandise, which resulted in an increase in merchandise quantity and profit.  This time, Svetlana wants to use a loan in the amount of 21,000 hryvnia to purchase tea, coffee, food products and sausage for a subsequent retail sale.  At the present time, all three of Svetlana's daughters attend different education facilities, and she tries to help them financially as she can.  This is why she tries to invest in her business in order to support her family.  Also to support the family, Svetlana's husband decided to get involved in an agricultural business and installed a large greenhouse and plans to install another one in the near future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1174365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Currently, she is able to buy merchandise at a discount, which will allow her to make an additional profit without raising her prices.  There is an event happening in Olga's family this autumn - her son's wedding.  She wants to help her son with the wedding expenses and also with the living arrangements after the wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1174368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

At present Magdalina\u2019s sister sometimes helps her out. Magdalina is very talented. She writes poems and songs and is a book author.\r\n\r\nMagalina needs additional funds in the amount of 5,000 UAH in order to buy musical instruments (traditional Ukrainian flutes, psalteries, maracas etc) and children\u2019s toys, which are going to be needed in future performances.

She lives with her son's family and helps bring up her grandchildren. Forty years ago Kalbubu made animal farming the main source of income for her family. Having started this business with 5,000 KGS, Kalbubu currently has two dairy cows and their calves and 3.6 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows potatoes and grains. The monthly income from the farm is 8,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nTo expand her business further, Kalbubu has contacted Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy dairy cows to increase her milk yield.

As the main breadwinner for her family, she has worked in field crop farming and animal husbandry for 14 years. She began her business with a sum of 6,000 somoni. Thanks to her persistent work, Keremetkan currently has 5 dairy cows and their calves, 40 sheep and goats, and 2 horses on her farm. Her farming provides a monthly income of about 4,000 somoni. \r\n\r\nKeremetkan also works 3 hectares of land where she grows potatoes, sunflowers, and corn for livestock feed. The seasonal income from her business allows Keremetkan to pay for her daughter's and son's educations in the capital. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of long-term business development, Keremetkan turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 somoni in order to purchase young livestock. Kerematkan plans to use the income from her loan to invest in the development of her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1171791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nichkesai village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-08-24T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-23T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keremetkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1387.5,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":65008.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743576},{"amount":1325.79,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":65008.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.71,"payment_id":529946677}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T21:22:47Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:07:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie Morgan","image":1134508}},{"id":462376,"name":"Ellchin","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Elchinu 28 let.

children. She works in an agricultural administrative office. \r\n\r\nTo supplement her family's income, for the last 12 years Gulsaira has grown crops and raised cattle. Despite beginning with a sum of only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), thanks to her persistent hard work Gulsaira now has 1 dairy cow and calf, 15 head of sheep and goats, 1 horse, and 1 heifer. Gulsaira also has 1.2 hectares of land where she grows beans, corn and potatoes. The monthly income from her farm is 5,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nGulsaira has contacted the company Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS, in order to further develop her business by purchasing more dairy cows to increase milk production. She plans to use the income generated by this expansion to renovate her barn and improve conditions for raising her animals. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1171879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Orto-Aryk village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-08-24T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-23T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743577},{"amount":1074.99,"local_amount":49999.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50366.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426662},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":0.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942368},{"amount":616.31,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":30220.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.69,"payment_id":529946678}],"funded_date":"2012-08-25T17:21:45Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":461131,"name":"Mario Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario Antonio de 56 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, desde hace 22 a\u00f1os que se dedica a la carpinter\u00eda, iniciativa de trabajo que la adquiri\u00f3 con aprendiz de una carpinter\u00eda, ya que con el tiempo decidi\u00f3 poner su propia carpinter\u00eda con un poco de ahorro que tenia, en la actualidad ha podido obtener buenos ingresos, gracias a su buen trabajo, responsabilidad, con sus clientes.

She has become a great baker, which is a result of her 31 years of doing this type of work and from her experience in knowing what her customers like.  She works with the help of her two daughters who support her in the daily production.  It is going very well and her customer base has grown compared to the number of customers she had when she began.  She knows that to keep her customers happy she must fulfill their orders punctually and provide them with a high-quality product that always meets their expectations.  She has big plans for the future, but what she most wants right now is to be able to have a bigger bakery with more supplies, where she can increase production.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan from MFP and she is thankful to all the people that made it possible.

is a 27-year-old married mother of one daughter who is still under school age. She and her husband earn a living as rice farmers. They also earn additional income by working as paid workers, which they have done for several years. Their current business earns them almost 20,000 KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. They manage to save about 10,000 KHR each day for future needs.\r\n\r\nSavy\u2019s group consists of two members who live in the same village. Savy is in her second cycle with VisionFund. The first loan has helped her relieve the financial burden of everyday expenses for her family and keep some money as savings for building a house.

He makes his purchases on a weekly basis and sells daily, and his principal clients are those businesses that have become his fixed buyers and who are continuously recommending new clients. \r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to buy a metalworking lathe, in order to leave a strong empresarial legacy for his children. This is why he works so hard every day, hoping to improve his work all the time. \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for this loan from Kiva which he hopes to use to buy materials such as iron, bronze, aluminum, welding equipment and metal rods. His loan will be helpful because he currently works asking for a down payment from his clients of 50%, in order to buy the materials that he needs to begin his work. Currently his working capital is not sufficient to make all his purchases. With this loan he will be able to work more comfortably and better attend his current clients, while also increasing his client base.

","en":"Alexander, 38 years old, works sewing bags. This work generates his principal income which he uses to support his family. This has become a family tradition, as his father also works sewing bags and with him he learned to work in all areas of operations including design, cutting, sewing, and assembling all of the necessary pieces. He worked doing this for 12 years in various enterprises, until he got tired of working for others and decided to start working independently. In 2005 he opened his own shop, investing his money and some machinary from the last place he had worked, and little by little he was able to acquire a small punching machine. With his high quality products, he was able to venture into the market where there are many accessory and bag shops, located in the center of the city, where the majority of his clients are. His biggest dream is to grow his business and have his own location, where he can put the products he makes on display. \r\n\r\nCurently he is applying for this loan from Kiva, his first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy synthetic leather, linings, yarn, and other materials in bulk in order to obtain special discounts. This will allow him to improve his prices, becoming more competitive as a result of his Kiva loan.

con su t\u00edo y con su experiencia emprendi\u00f3 su aventura de negocios, organizando un taller que gradualmente ha crecido y que hoy maneja una amplia clientela que compra a \u00e9l puertas,

En la actualidad su principal desaf\u00edo es adecuar locativamente su taller, pues la cubierta  est\u00e1 en mal estado y el piso necesita repararlo para trabajar de manera segura y mucho m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual realizar\u00e1 los trabajos constructivos que requiere su taller, al que poco a poco quiere dotarlo de maquinaria y equipos y fortalecerlo mucho mas, porque es su fuente principal de ingresos con el que planea aumentar el bienestar de su familia.       ","en":"\u00c1ngel, 56, is a husband and father of two children who are 26 and 32 years old, a family for whom he directs all his efforts so that they will acquire more wellbeing every day. \r\n\r\nHe has owned a cabinet-making shop for 14 years because 17 years ago he learned from his uncle and with the experience gained started his own business venture.  He set up a shop that has gradually grown and today he has a large clientele that buys doors, windows, cupboards and armoires mainly.  He sells for cash and his sales are weekly.  \u00c1ngel works all day, every day.  He takes small breaks to eat.  His customers request the product and he interprets it, presents a drawing and a price quote, assembles and finishes the item which he finally sells for cash directly to consumers who are mostly employees and institutions that request his services because they know him and get good prices.\r\n\r\nHis current challenge is to make some physical improvements to his shop because the roof is in poor shape and the floor needs to be repaired in order to work safely and more comfortably.

hace 10 a\u00f1os, donde fabrica vestidos femeninos y elabora especialmente  productos de lencer\u00eda para el hogar, como forros para licuadoras, cortinas, cubrelechos, y accesorios femeninos, como vinchas, bolsos, fajones y disfraces que elabora con mayor \u00e9nfasis en la \u00e9poca del Carnaval de Barranquilla.  Isabel aprendi\u00f3 este arte  en un colegio religioso donde estudi\u00f3, el que enfatizaba las manualidades; sus primeros pasos los dio  fabricando  disfraces para sus propios hijos, hoy en las edades de 26 y 31 a\u00f1os. Sus ventas las realiza directamente a sus clientes y no utiliza intermediarios, los principales productos son disfraces y productos de lencer\u00eda, ella usualmente quiere acceder a descuentos especiales de sus proveedores, porque su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para obtener precios excepcionales y trasladarlos a su oferta, haci\u00e9ndola cada vez m\u00e1s competitiva.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos y materias primas para producir prendas de vestir, disfraces y accesorios en tela.  Sus ventas las realizan en las dos modalidades de cr\u00e9dito y de contado, inicia sus actividades desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana y las extiende usualmente hasta las 5 de la tarde, aunque en tiempo en el cual   incrementan su producci\u00f3n, porque hay mucha demanda en el mercado.  Sus principales clientes son amigos y los referidos de estos, que apoyan su gesti\u00f3n voz a voz porque conocen la calidad de las prendas  que Isabel elabora. Isabel disfruta su trabajo y lo asume como una terapia de relajaci\u00f3n, vive en la actualidad con su hija que muy pronto viajar\u00e1 a Canad\u00e1 y con su esposo que es pensionado de una empresa. ","en":"Isabel is 59 years old. For the past ten years she has had a small workshop where she makes women's clothing and lingerie items for the home such as blender liners, curtains, and bedspreads. She also makes feminine accessories like headbands, handbags, and costumes, which she makes with greater emphasis during the season of Carnaval in Barranquilla.  \r\n\r\nIsabel learned this art when she was a student at a religious school that emphasized crafts. At first she made costumes for her own children, who are now 26 and 31 years old. She sells her products directly to customers and does not use intermediaries. Her main items are costumes and lingerie products.\r\n\r\nIsabel wants to access special discounts from her material providers. Her working capital is not enough to obtain exceptional prices and transfer them to her work in order to become more competitive. This is why she is requesting this loan, her first funding request with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan, she will purchase inputs and primary materials for producing garments, costumes, and fabric accessories. \r\n\r\nIn her sales Isabel uses both credit and cash.

She is married to Estanis, 62, and together they have 4 children that they raised and educated and are now independent.  Lorreine now lives with her husband in her own home, where they share their days with a desire to work hard in order to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nLorreine has a business making and repairing garments.  She works in her house, where she awaits the arrival of her friends, neighbors and personal acquaintances who need to buy an exclusive garment, or who simply need some small mending work done such as mending a split seam, putting a button on a shirt or pair of pants, or putting in a zipper.  She has been doing this work for 10 years, and she does it with an old sewing machine that she keeps that she is very fond of, as she considers it to be her loyal work companion.  She always provides friendly service, and she is very thorough and observant, qualities that have enabled her to complete her work with excellent quality finishes.  Alongside this activity, she sometimes also sells used clothing at that bank of the river.  She has been doing this for 2 years, and this business has also done very well.  And if that weren't enough, she also works in the mornings in a sawmill in the city, which increases her income.  Now she is hoping to establish a dressmaking business that is much more complete, and to do this she needs to buy a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nThis is Lorreine's third loan with MFP, and she is very content to know that she has financial support, guaranteeing her the ability to continue working with a lot of tranquility.

Alone, she has raised 4 children. Chynarkul works as a teacher of the Kyrgyz language in the school of the Bokombaevo village. As a source of additional income for her family, she has also been growing crops and raising livestock for the past 20 years, having started her business with a purchase of a dairy cow. Thanks to Chynarkul's hard work, her herd currently includes 2 dairy cows with offspring, 10 goats and sheep, and 2 horses, while the business' monthly income amounts to roughly 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nAs the autumn season is particularly busy in agriculture, Chynarkul, like many other farmers, needs financial support in order to develop her business. In light of this, Chynarkul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock for fattening. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1175441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He has two post-secondary degrees: one in electronics and electronic technologies from the Zaporozhye State Engineering Academy, and another in enterprise economics. Now, Alexander applies his academic knowledge to his business. His father owns an auto parts store, where Alexander has rented two rooms for his computer shop.\r\n\r\nAlexander would like to purchase a new lot of electronics, namely notebook computers and printers, and so has turned to Kiva for a loan of 21,000 hryvnia. He plans to use his additional profits to expand the range of his merchandise and to improve his retail location - together with his father, Alexander plans to build another store for the auto parts

He worked there for a while, bringing money home to his parents so they could have a chance at a better quality of life and better financial opportunities.  However, because of problems with violence, he had to leave his municipality as an outcast and he came to the city looking for opportunities to get ahead financially.  This is how he began selling fruit and vegetables and, with this business, he began to earn his living.

She always had to support herself by her own means.  She became a mother when she was very young.  Nevertheless, her desire to get ahead with two children allowed her to finish high school.  At one time she was somewhat ill, and she very depressed.  However, her children, the driving force of her life, gave her a lot of strength.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 she managed to complete her nursing studies.  She loves the health field, and is delighted helping others.  She believes that the best way to do so is to specialize more in this area.  That is why she wants to continue with her studies in health administration.  This way she will get employment so that her children are able to have a great future and a university degree as well.\r\n\r\nThe following is Erika Andrea\u2019s story in her own words:\r\n\r\nHi, my name is Erika Andrea.  I am 38 years old, and I have been married for 19 years.  I have two children, an 18 year old boy and a 15 year old girl.  We live with my 42 year old husband.\r\n\r\nI have always lived in Bogot\u00e1.  My mother left for Venezuela when I was two years old.   From then on I lived with my maternal grandmother.  I never knew my paternal family.   It should be noted that my father rarely, well, never lived with me.  We always had a lot of financial problems.  My grandmother, when she could, gave me an education and what I needed.  Then, one day, when I was 17, she died of stomach cancer.\r\n\r\nAfter this my life took a terrible turn.  My aunt and uncle threw me out of the house.  I lost a year of school (I was in the tenth grade at this time), and because of this I lost my place at the school.  At this time I had a friend who supported me and helped me a lot.  He proposed that we live together.   Because of my situation and what I earned Saturdays and Sundays and when I was not in school, which was not enough for anything, I decided to accept.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 I managed to finish my nursing studies.  It is a profession that I love with all of my heart.  Given that I love helping others, there is nothing better than taking care of their health.\r\n\r\nWhen I graduated as a nursing assistant I received the medal of merit for my effort and my good grades.  Even though I could not exercise my profession due to the care, the appointments, my daughter\u2019s surgeries, and some of my own health problems (after the cancer was controlled they diagnosed me with endometriosis), one day I decided that now that my children are big I can continue with what I like most in my life\u2026my profession.\r\n\r\nSix months ago I started studying health administration at Campoalto.  It has been going very well for me\u2026.however, my husband was left without work for eight months and my son is at the university.  Even though my husband did everything possible to help me, and he found work, the debts that we have are very large.\r\n\r\nI want and I wish to continue studying.  I think I owe it to myself.  This is the time to be able to grow in relation to work.  This way I can also be able to help my husband financially.  Because I was not able to practice my career, and it has been five years since I have had work experience, nobody hires me.\r\n\r\nThat is why I am asking you, please, from my heart, help me accomplish my dream.  This is in order to be able to help my husband pay our debts and the expenses that are coming.  My daughter is close to finishing high school, and it would make me very happy for her to go to the university.  From the bottom of my heart I thank you for the help that you are able to lend me.\r\n\r\nGod bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study the second semester of health administration.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2012-08-24T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-23T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":142999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308110658},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":142999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315347039},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":142999.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322956413},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-16T10:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":142999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331334988},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":142999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339480572}],"funded_date":"2012-08-24T21:52:43Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:21:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":463771,"name":"Djaano Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Djaano is a group made up of two women who are 46 years and 56 years old.

At that time, faced with the need to generate the income her household needed and to contribute along with her husband to supporting their two children, Miriam decided to start her own sewing studio through a third party and that is how she got ahead.

oldest live separately.  To provide a source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for five years, having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Sagyn's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring, ten small livestock and one horse, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 5,000 som (KGS).  She also works on 9 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs, which serve as livestock feed.  Because the fall season is especially active, which has to do with seasonality of the agricultural sphere, Sagyn, just like many other village residents, needs financial support to develop her business.  Due to this, Sagyn requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued business development and wants to help her son to hold a wedding next

She is a very likeable person who is very proud of her three children because they are very good people and very good students.\n\nElvia opened a small grocery store in 2005 that she tends to from 7am until the early evening.  Her greatest advantage is that there are no other grocery stores in the community and her neighbors make daily purchases in her store although sales have dropped lately because basic staples are getting more and more expensive every day.\n\nThe loan Elvia is asking for is needed to buy rice, lard, canned goods, dairy products, soft-drinks, sugar, beans, candy, bread and snacks, among others.  With support from the loan she will be able to stock more varied products so that her customers will always be able to find what they need.\n\nHer goal is to support her children\u2019s schooling although she does fear that when they graduate they will be unable to find jobs so she hopes they will opt to have businesses of their own like she has.

About six years ago, she began working as an employee at a clothing store and a year ago, she opened her own clothing store selling women's, men's, and children's clothing.  She has slowly grown the business, building a loyal customer base who pay in cash and improve her offerings.

married. She has brought up two children. Her youngest son, 16 years old, helps her in everything. Chynygul works as a teacher at the local school. As an additional source of income for her family, for some 30 years she has also been doing farm work and raising livestock, having launched this business with 1,000 KGS. Thanks to Chynygul\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes five cows with calves, 55 heads of small cattle, and two horses. Her monthly revenues from her farm are about 4,000 KGS. In addition, Chynygul works four ha [about 9.4 acres] of land, growing perennials that are used as animal feed.\r\n\r\nSince the fall season is particularly busy due to seasonal agricultural work, Chynygul,  like many village dwellers, is in need of financial support to develop her business. This is why she turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 70,000 KGS to buy dairy cows. Chynygul would like to use part of her resulting revenues to buy a notebook for her son, who is preparing to apply for college; in the future she plans to keep reinvesting in her business.

Her customer base rapidly grew, and she began adding dishes to her menu focusing on well-prepared traditional regional dishes. She does the cooking in the morning, while her son deals with the customers during the day. She makes her purchases daily in precise quantities, and she also keeps records of her sales every day. Currently she is applying for her first loan from Kiva and the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use the loan to purchase supplies to make food, plastic tables and chairs, sodas, and disposable containers so that she can offer home delivery. With her loan from Kiva she will be able to provide better service to her clientele, which will build loyalty and help her maintain her position in the marketplace. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1170943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase supplies for her restaurant, plastic tables and chairs, soda, and disposable containers in order to offer home delivery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-25T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-24T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70224},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82129},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":84045},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":86006},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88013},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":90067},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":92168},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":94319},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96520},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":98772},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":101076},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":116661}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.9,"local_amount":70224,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":72538.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775464},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":82129,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84835.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387448},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":84045,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86814.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130630},{"amount":48.87,"local_amount":86006,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":88840.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519492},{"amount":441.82,"local_amount":777596,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":803221.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967607}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T19:34:49Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick  King","image":null}},{"id":462159,"name":"Mercy Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MERCY MARIBEL TIENE 27 A\u00d1OS ES SOLTERA VIVE CON LOS PADRES NO TIENE HIJOS.\n\nMERCY SE DEDICA A LA AGRICULTURA EN LA SIEMBRA DE MAIZ TRIGO PAPAS CEBADA EN TERRENOS ARRENDADAS, EN DINERO LO SOLICITA PARA LA COMPRAR DE ABONOS Y FERTILIZANTES INSECTICIDAS PARA LOS CULTIVOS, EL DIENRO LE AYUDADO AUMENTAR LA PRODUCCION Y TENER PRODUCTOS DE CALIDAD.\n\nMERCY SUE\u00d1A CON PODER COMPRAR TERRENOS PARA TENER SU PROPIA PRODUCCION Y EN LOS TIEMPOS LIBRES SE DEDICA A DESCANZAR CON EL LA FAILIA.","en":"Mercy Maribel, 27, is single and lives with her parents.
