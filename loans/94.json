This is Diana S., a 20-year-old woman from Mbeya.  She is married, and she has a 1-year-old child. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2005, Diana has been operating a clothing-sales business.  In particular, she purchases clothes at wholesale prices and then sells the clothes at retail prices for a profit.  She works at the business 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.  By doing so, Diana earns approximately $120 per month from her business.  She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase additional clothes in bulk.  In the future, she plans to open the same business at a new location.  Diana thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional clothing in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana J.

Her children are the reason behind her efforts. Every morning Semona goes out with her three-wheeled cart to sell delicious quinoa juice (hot juice made from liquidized quinoa, cornstarch, and apples) that she makes herself. The hot beverage is in great demand because in this region temperatures are cool in the mornings, which encourages people to drink something warm. What Semona likes most about her work is that she can drink the glasses of juice she wants when she's hungry. She has been in this line of work for 5 years and believes that the hardest part is having to wake up early and go out in the cold streets in order to sell. In the future she longs to have a store where she can work with greater ease and better serve her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Semona's second loan with MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma) and she feels very confident that she will be able to make her payments on time.

She has six children between the ages of 2 and 26.  Three of them go to school.  Maria finished second grade but did not continue with school because her father made his children spend most of their time working on the machamba (small family farm).  She lives in her own house and does not support anyone other than her family.\r\n\r\nMaria lived in a part of the District (Mandevo) about 10 kilometers from the town of Sede.  Because of the war, she had to move to Sede, where she has lived ever since.  After her arrival, she began a small business selling pies at the corners of the school, but with her husband's help she acquired a stall at the Central Market where she sells staple goods such as tomatoes, onions, carrots and rice.  She spends on average 5,000 meticais on her purchases and makes a profit of 3,000 meticais, which she uses for household needs and construction expenses.  She also makes meals (soups) to sell daily at the Market and earns 350 meticais.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy products (tomatoes, onions, carrots, rice, etc.) to increase her inventory.  The previous loan of 5,000 meticais was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe paid off the loan easily and is confident that she will do the same with this second loan.  She hopes to have more loans because she would like to help her daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":628604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It includes tips and tools for handling a variety of tasks, from ordering flowers to creating registries, even offering a final wedding day checklist for the maid of honor.\n\nAlbert explains that the planner isn\u2019t meant to cover every contingency, but serve as a point of reference.  \u201cIf this were a complete list, then this would be a cookie-cutter event, and you\u2019d sign up for a color and a date, and we\u2019d crank you through.  But it\u2019s not supposed to do that.  This is supposed to be your great day.  You\u2019ve never done this before, so you need a starting point. This is your starting point.\u201d\n\nPublishing the book is a team effort. Albert handles advertisement sales and the book\u2019s distribution.  Cece does editing and advertisement design.  All of the firms that advertise in \u201cThe Wedding and Quince\u00f1eara Planner\u201d distribute copies of the book to their customers.  Cece and Albert print an updated copy of \u201cThe Wedding and Quincea\u00f1era Planner\u201d every 6 months.\n\nAlbert and Cece provide the \u201cThe Wedding and Quicea\u00f1era Planner\u201d free to customers because they generate revenue through advertisements.  Unfortunately, this year some of the advertisers were late with their payments.  \u201cWe had been expanding until about a year ago, when we had a few advertisers decide not to renew their contracts. This fall, we had more that decided not to renew, and I had a hard time collecting the money.\u201d  Because publishing requires up-front payment, this put them in a bind. \u201cWe decided we needed to do something to get the books printed so we\u2019d have them to hand out at the wedding fair.  We went to the bank and didn\u2019t quite meet their criteria, but she recommended ACCION to us.\u201d\n\nThe loan provided Albert and Cece the funds needed to publish the planner in time for the semi-annual wedding fair, their biggest business event.  Without this loan, Albert and Cece would have had to refund what advertising revenues they had collected and would not have been able to publish the book.  Albert and Cece advise other business owners to \u201cKeep an eye on your receivables.  Don\u2019t expect it (money) to automatically flow in.\u201d\n\nAlbert and Cece believe in the long-term potential of their business as much as they believe in the product they offer.  Albert says that business is picking up again, and that he and Cece are continuing to receive positive feedback from customers.  \u201cOne couple told me, \u2018I bought a formal planner, but it hasn\u2019t been nearly as informative as your book\u2019\u2026 That\u2019s rewarding.  Knowing that a couple is sampling from your publication and they\u2019re on the right feet.\u201d\n\nAlbert and Cece started this business six years ago, after family friends started a similar business in another city.  They saw that Corpus Christi didn\u2019t have an equivalent service, and decided to create one based on their friends\u2019 recommendation.  Albert and Cece and their five children are supported by this business.

Union) are requesting their first loan with Esperanza International. They hope this loan will help them establish their businesses and generate better profits to improve their living conditions.  In San Pedro de Macoris, the employment opportunities are not abundant due to the sugar cane industry collapse and the town's proximity to the capital. (For some industries it's not profitable to establish operations in San Pedro de Macoris, and some people cannot commute to Santo Domingo to work every day due to transportation costs).  \r\n\r\nRamon C. is the group coordinator. He is an electrician and decided to start making power inverters. This generates good profits because power outages are common in the Dominican Republic. Inverters are charged with batteries (the same kind you use in cars), and allow you to run some appliances for a reasonable amount of time. He will use this loan to buy wires and generator parts that are necessary to make inverters. Right now, he works out of his home but his hope is that profits from his sales will allow him to set up his own workshop, and eventually, build a new house of his own.   \r\n\r\nPlease help support these new entrepreneurs' initiatives with a Kiva loan.

Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ma. Fe A. is 36 years old and married to Alejandro A. who is a 37-year-old rice farmer. The couple has three very young children who range in age from 1 to 11 years old. The family lives in the village of Brgy. Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. Her fondest dream is to improve her family's standard of living, to earn enough to sustain the needs of her family and to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nMa Fe knows and understands so well that her husband strives hard to earn for them but it is still not enough because as a farmer he earns a seasonal type of income, rice being harvested only after 3 to 4 months of planting. That\u2019s why Ma Fe looked for another source of income so that she could help her husband increase the household income. Using some of her husband's income from the farm as capital, she put up a small general store adjacent to their house selling basic household commodities that her neighbors needed. She just revolved the income she earned to buy new stocks to sell, until 2003 when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access more capital to expand her operations. As she paid off each loan, she was able to borrow bigger amounts effectively increasing her income capacity. It now earns a net profit of PHP 3,000 per month, which is a big help to this young household. Being a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon has also helped in their rice production as she has used some of the loans to purchase fertilizer for her husband's rice farm, also improving the yield at harvest time.\r\n\r\nFor her previous 13th cycle loan, she borrowed Php 13,000 as additional working capital for her general store and for the rice farm. She paid all her weekly installments in full and on time without any delays. Now she is borrowing for her 14th cycle, a loan of Php 15,000 to be used as additional capital for her general store and to buy fertilizer for her rice farm. The income from this loan will be saved for the education of her children and part will be used to pay for their household expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams.

She is 50 years old, married and childless though she has 4 nephews and nieces 15,13, 9 and 7 years old. They are all in school. She never studied, since her parents didn't allow her or her sisters to go to school saying she would learn prostitution. She lives in her own house with her husband, nephews and nieces. Apart from these, she has no other dependents. \r\n\r\nShe left Matola for the district of Boane when she was still very young. She continued to live there after she was married. She has had her own shop for more than 6 years, and has an employee to help her with the business. She earns around 6500 MZN a month, and uses it to cover her household expenses while saving some at home, since she's unfamiliar with the banking system. \r\n\r\nIn the past she took out loans through the TCHUMA credit union but didn't continue for various reasons. She learned about Hluvuku through business partners who are already clients. This is her fifth loan with Hluvuku, for 22,000 MZN. She plans to buy products (beer, wine, soft drinks, potatoes and others) to increase her stock. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of one day owning a suitable home, and in the future would like to take out additional loans for her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Beatriz has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Beatriz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. Beatriz is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan she has taken out from HSPFI.

Maximina is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for the much larger amount of 20,000 PHP to purchase a new sewing machine and support the inventories of her store. This will allow her to grow their businesses further so that their children can fulfill their dreams of completing college degrees and finding good jobs. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her activities will generate a steady income to improve her financial stability and give a better life to her family in a decent manner. Maximina\u2019s biggest dream is to have a successful tailoring business and to manage a full-fledged mini-grocery store someday. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty.

She is 37 years old. Evelyn is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nEvelyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. \r\n\r\nEvelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About CEVI:<\/b>\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

Dovi A., 24, is married and mother of three children.

When plenty of palm nuts are available, she buys them up and produces palm oil which she then keeps to sell when it is in short supply. Unfortunately, the income from this business is not nearly enough to supply the basic needs of her family. She is requesting a loan in the amount of US$ 300 so that she can purchase a sufficient quantity of palm nuts.

For the past 5 years she has enjoyed having her own stall at the market.  She does not have to worry about paying high rent and it allows her to have a profitable business.  \r\n\r\nShe was an ambulatory salesperson for about 8 years.  However,  the city government started to restrict licenses for ambulatory salespeople and she had to abandon selling in the streets and move to the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe became interested in selling clothing when she started to sell clothing at wholesale prices out of her house.  She also worked making coin purses and wallets.  She then realized that the business of selling clothing would be profitable if she worked harder.\r\n\r\nCandelaria also receives rental income from a studio that she rents out which is located on the second floor of her house.  She is 57 years old and she still has many plans for the future.  One of her plans is to get together with a group of women like her and start a small business that specializes in making clothing.

She doesn\u2019t speak much Spanish so her fellow group members helped with her interview and also described some of their own businesses and why they decided to get together on a microloan. \r\nOrnise sells clothing which she buys in bundles. She travels from Santo Domingo all the way to Dajabon, a city on the border with Haiti with a large commercial market. It is about a 5\u00bd hour riD.. Another member of the group is involved with the same business. The other businesses incluD. a butcher shop and a fried food stand. Two of the members own colmados (convenience stores). \r\nCarine D. L. C. is the Group 4 Coordinator. This group was interviewed during a visit to Esperanza International\u2019s DR headquarters in Santo Domingo. Carine also sells clothing. She would like to increase her business profits to build a reputation in her area.

However, she is not able to get out much because she has to attend to the store, which generates good profits that allow her to buy necessities for her home.

G. was born in the Gaza province in the south of Mozambique.  He is 60 years old and married, and the father of 3 children ages 19 to 23.  He completed through the second grade in the old system, and dropped out due to the poor treatment he received at school for being a farmer's son.   \r\n\r\nHe left Chokw\u00e9 for Maputo to look for work.  He worked at Hotel Rovuma as a server for 5 years, but earned little.  He had an offer to work in the Hotel Libombos in the district of Namaacha on the border of Swaziland.  He went to work there for 2 years but left the job due to the bad working environment with his coworkers, who felt that he did not deserve the position that he held.  But with the money he had earned and the help of his wife who is a seamstress, Albino opened his own tailoring and shoe cobbling business, activities he had learned with the missionary nuns when he attended school.  Today he is the owner of a tailoring and cobbler shop called TchapoTchapo.  Albino is very happy because today he is one of the most requested tailors in the district thanks to the sewing machine he was able to buy with a loan from Hluvuku and Kiva.  That machine was stolen, which has made his work more difficult. \r\n\r\nHe works from 7am to 6pm at his shop except on Thursdays and Saturdays.  He has a stand in the market that is opened twice per week.  He has had more profits from the shoes because he has a lot of work, especially during the rainy season because shoes often come apart due to the muddy clay that exists during that time.  He has had monthly profits of 6.000mt and is able to save 1.500.00mt per month because he is not supporting anyone because he is the only one of his family who survived the war. \r\n\r\nThis is Albino's fourth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva.  The first three were used to purchase fabric and a machine to grind shoe soles.  He is requesting this fourth loan of 15.000.00 to purchase a sewing machine because at the beginning of the year he had many requests for school uniforms and wants to meet the needs of all of his customers and make greater profits.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

They hope to build their own beautiful house, expanding their fishing business and have wider space for their fishing equipment.

Magdalena thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The thing she likes about her job is that she travels and meets a lot of people. Her business is also profitable because she has her clients that pre-order their clothing items. In the future she wants to have her own store. She has received 11 loans from MFP and she enjoys working with the members of her communal bank.

Kobiljon is 34 years old, married, and has three children. He grows vegetables and sells them in the market for income. He has been working in this business sphere for almost 15 years and has gained a lot of experience. \r\n\r\nKobiljon has a large family considering that he is living with his parents. With his large family, Kobiljon works almost every day to generate revenue to support his family. Because of his family relying on vegetable growing, Kobiljon needs a loan to purchase necessary supplies for his current harvest and in that way to earn enough money for supporting his family. This will be his first loan with IMON International and Kiva, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married and has four children. Shairkul\u2019s husband is a security officer in a learning center. Being inspired by Kyrgyz traditional style of sewing and successful designers, who made their business ideas come true, Shairkul dared to get involved in the sewing and textile industry. Five years ago, she bought her first sewing machine, some fabric and other sewing supplies for a total sum of 8,000 soms. Just like every newcomer in business, she was afraid of risk and lack of experience. She was amazed at how her works were accepted among her fellows and potential customers, and soon became widely known in her town of Tokmok as one of the best seamstresses and designers. Shairkul applied for a loan in order to buy one more sewing machine, because she plans to broaden her team. Of course, as any other designer, Shairkul dreams of opening her own fashion house. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This is 35-year-old Zuhura W. K. from Tukuyu.  She is married with two children between the ages of 11 and 14 and is also responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents passed away.  Zuhura has been operating a shop since 2005, selling vitenge (see below), bedsheets, sweaters, blankets, and gowns. Assisted by her younger sister, she works 10 hours each day, 7 days per week, currently earning about $85 from her business.

Zuhura thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nTraditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women is called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This is 32-year-old Neema M. from Mwanza. She is single with one child, age 2.5 years old. Neema has been running a beauty salon since 2008. Her business is a place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, or blue hair and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Neema currently earns about $150 US from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 US in order to purchase a dryer and long hair for re-sale to customers. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She owns a business venture, providing general clothing services to local community members and that is by sewing different kinds of clothes.  Katerinauataliatalosaga has 7 years of experience in this business.  Katerinauataliatalosaga needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Katerinauataliatalosaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Katerinauataliatalosaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Katerinauataliatalosaga L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for over 10 years.  During this time she has seen her business grow thanks to the loans from this organization.\r\n\r\nRecently, her eldest daughter graduated from university and she is now requesting funding to pay for her second daughter's university education in the field of nursing.  She highly values education for her children and is looking for ways to provide for her youngest, who is still under her charge.  This is the reason why she moved to the La Ceiba neighborhood because it's more family oriented and more prosperous so the residents there tend to be more studious and set a good example.\r\n\r\nShe used to work in a private home, the owner of which worked for a laundry service.  Gradually, he began to fall short of expectations and, because of Blanca's behavior, she was asked to take over the business.  Later on, she became independent and opened her own laundry which she started with a home washing machine that her husband gave her.  Over these ten years, with help from the Fundaci\u00f3n, the business has produced enough to buy two more washing machines.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n for the help it has given her.

She has lived there with her family in a three-room brick house for the last three years. Her husband is a driver by profession, and he drives a tractor in the fields. He works in the fields from day to night but earns very little, which does not allow him to fulfill the basic needs of his family. This is why he has decided to start a grocery store business.

Lita currently receives many orders for her work and has been able to attract many customers.  Her oldest daughter helps her and is learning the trade, which makes her proud.

Kuy also faces problems related to water supply, and even during the rainy season there is sometimes not enough water for plantation. Inflation is among the main factors contributing to the low profits from farming in the area, since the prices of fertilizers and rice seeds have skyrocketed.
