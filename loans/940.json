Her main challenge now is to earn sufficient working capital to achieve many of her entrepreneurial dreams, which is what she hopes to gradually achieve through consecutive credikivas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1170998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cases of refreshments and soft drinks in greater volumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-25T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-24T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89495},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93916},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96108},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":98350},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100645},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102993},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105396},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":107856},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110372},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112948},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":115583},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118280},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121040},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127018}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.71,"local_amount":89495,"processed_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":92197.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775465},{"amount":40.13,"local_amount":70821,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":72959.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994279},{"amount":110.84,"local_amount":195604,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":201511.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497552},{"amount":12.44,"local_amount":21949,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":22611.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527367},{"amount":56.94,"local_amount":100474,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":103508.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928140},{"amount":231.58,"local_amount":408663,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":421004.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967608},{"amount":339.68,"local_amount":612994,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":631506.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.68,"payment_id":459104665}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T23:28:55Z","paid_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Fiona Craig","image":null}},{"id":464045,"name":"Arnida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arnida is 33 years old and is married with two children.

The city of Cartago was the capital of Costa Rica until 1823. It is known for having a mountainous relief formed by two mountain ranges: the Central and the mountain range of Talamanca.  The climate is cold most of the year due to the two volcanoes in the area called Irazu and Turrialba. \r\n\r\nIsmael has made his living in agriculture for many years, specifically in the production of coffee. He has succeeded in creating his own coffee plantation because of the various loans he has received with the local communal bank. He has grown financially and improved his quality of life. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he would like a loan for one million forty thousand colones (CRC 1,040,000) to buy small coffee plants and  replace the old plants in his plantation.  In this way he will have a better harvest, be able to contribute to household expenses, and have a better life. \r\n\r\nHe is part of the Empresa de Credito Communal de El Sauce de Santa Teresita Turrialba, one of the 150 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. He says that with this loan he expects to be able to continue to grow as a farmer.

Justin lives with his wife and children, and he and his wife both provide for the family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for the family's various needs, Justin has been working as a couturier in his region for the past ten or so years. On the side, he sells phone cards. This business allows him to support his family without much difficulty. Justin stocks up in his region and in a town in Benin.\r\n\r\nStriving to satisfy his customers and increase his sales and revenue, Justin, along with the other members of the IFESOWAKPO group, is seeking a third loan from ALID\u00e9.

The representative of the group, who is named Marie Kottin, is the one with her hand raised in the photo. This is the sixth time that the group requests financial support from ALID\u00e9 in order to enhance their activity. Marie Kottin is 59 years old and married to a certain Idelphonse. The couple has four children some of whom attend school at their expense. Marie Kottin and her husband live together with their children and share the various family expenses. Marie Kottin did not go to school. For about 20 years she has been selling charcoal and wine from her home. Marie Kottin buys her products from resellers. This business enables her to meet her family's needs without too much difficulty. Her customers' needs are becoming increasingly large and in view of her limited means, Marie Kottin can no longer satisfy the demand. Due to this situation and because they have limited resources, Marie Kottin and the other members of the MAHUTIN 2 group, request a loan from ALID\u00e9. The five previous loans were correctly repaid."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1177364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy charcoal and palm wine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-08-25T17:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-24T17:30:09Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Kottin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernadette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e9\u00efkon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083805},{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318210},{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926787},{"amount":83.08,"local_amount":43200,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43387.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059692},{"amount":94.42,"local_amount":49100,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":49312.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449646},{"amount":75.38,"local_amount":39200,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":39370,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347002464},{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355744788},{"amount":47.12,"local_amount":24500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-27T08:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":24606.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364449313},{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372853611},{"amount":75,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":39169.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381622282}],"funded_date":"2012-08-27T09:56:34Z","paid_date":"2013-08-22T08:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":462189,"name":"Claudia Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Claudia Mar\u00eda de cuarenta y cinco a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida, su hija y su nieta en casa propia;

","en":"Subon is not a young man, but despite his age he does not sit around idle. Having no formal education, he has been involved in raising livestock for his entire life.

Su experiencia comercial de  20 a\u00f1os, le ha permitido sacar adelante lo que se propone,  y la actividad comercial para \u00e9l es un proceso muy propio de su naturaleza, pues desde sus 8 a\u00f1os de edad se inclin\u00f3 por ella e hizo ejercicios de ventas; as\u00ed fue que cuando adulto  inici\u00f3 su propio negocio en el a\u00f1o 2004, tal como su sue\u00f1o se lo indic\u00f3 y aprovechando el auge de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares,  inici\u00f3 el servicio de llamadas, cobrando el valor de los minutos a celulares; poco a poco logr\u00f3 que a su alrededor, los vecinos accedieran a sus relaciones comerciales   y  combin\u00f3 esta actividad con la venta  de productos fritos, para lograr dos fuentes de ingresos y aumentar cada vez mas su capital de trabajo y con ello mas dinero en su haber.

He lives with his wife and two children, ages three and twelve years, for whom he works very hard so that they can have a promising future.\r\n\r\nJuan's twenty years of commercial experience have allowed him to achieve the goals he has set for himself. Commercial activity comes naturally to him, and since he was eight years old he has been inclined toward it and has practiced making sales. So it was that as an adult he started his own business in 2004, just as his dream had indicated. He took advantage of the rise of cell phones to start a calling service, charging the cost of cell phone minutes. Little by little he reached the point that in his neighbors in the area acceded their commercial relations to him. He combined this with the sale of fried products in order to achieve two streams of income and to contually augment his work capital and and in this way to increase his assets.\r\n\r\nHe currently sells directly to the final consumer, making cash transactions. He starts his work day around seven in the morning and works until ten at night. His main regular clients are residents of the area where he lives and has his business as well as passers-by who come through daily on their way to other areas. His goal is to continue growing his infrastructure and clientele, to increase sales, and obtain more utilities. His main challenge is that he lacks funds to grow his sales, although a great demand exists. This is why he is seeking a loan, the first financing that he has done through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this, he will buy supplies in greater volume and he will do so in cash in order to get discounts and diminish the costs of his products, little by little building a future of greater well-being for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1171152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The leader of the group, Solange (whose hand is raised on the photo), is 34 years old and is married to a nurse called Theodore. The couple has two children, of whom one attends school at their expense. Solange and her husband live together with their children. Solange did not go to school. Solange has been a hairdresser in her region for about 10 years. On a parallel basis, she sells locks of hair and hairdressing products. Solange works in this profession with passion, which is what enables her to provide for herself and her children. She buys her stock in Benin. In order to satisfy her customers, Solange requests a third loan with the other members of the MIDOUKPO 3 group. This loan will enable them to more adequately satisfy the demands of their clientele and make more profits. The previous loans were repaid correctly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1177446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

To support the basic expenses of her household, she and her husband have been working on one hectare of farmland for several years to grow paddy rice. This is their main source of income. They also use their spare time to earn additional income via working for others for a fee.  Lin took out her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner) in 2011 and repaid the entire loan with success. That loan supported her business and provided her family with a consistent income to maintain their living conditions. Now, she is applying for a second loan in the amount of 1,000,000 KHR.

her hometown of Corpus Christi. Esther\u2019s house is located on a busy street, so she\u2019ll have exposure. It also has ample parking for clients.\n\nSince she works out of her home, Esther has the ability to create her own schedule, which allows her to give optimum customer service. She can and will open her office for anyone at anytime, and if need be, go to a client\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cMy passion started in high school in my bookkeeping class,\u201d Esther said. The one chapter on taxes inspired her to begin filing taxes for family and friends for fun, then in 1986, Esther took class with H&R Block to learn of a change in the filing process, and that\u2019s when her business really began.\n\nFor 15 years after that, Esther went to work for an established income tax filing company. After offering options of how to improve their business, Esther learned that her suggestions were not going to be met, as the head of the corporation was the one to make any and all decisions. She later quit that job to work with a Certified Public Accountant who was making ten times what she was earning for filing taxes. From then, she decided to open her own business.\n\nAt her previous place of employment, clients would wait two to three hours for her services. Beginning in 2004 with part-time hours, Esther hired a receptionist for tax season; her business grew and she began offering full-time hours of operation in 2009. Currently, Esther has applied for a loan to hire another tax filer, or someone for data input, and extend her office to fit a waiting room that will include a play area for children, instead of having every client stand around. The expansion will include a restroom. None of this would be possible without the assistance of an Accion Texas Inc. loan.\n\nPassionate about learning more within her field, Esther attends Del Mar College every fall. It was there, in her business principles class, that she learned about resources and loans offered at Accion. \u201cI\u2019m just really excited,\u201d she

She is 45 years old and was born in Nicaragua. She has worked raising pigs for 12 years. At first, because of space, she kept a small number of pigs in her house and sold them before they were grown. \r\n\r\nWith dedication and work, she was able to get capital allowed her to move to bigger facilities, increasing her inventory of pigs, buying more breeding sows and having her own production cycle of pigs. Even though the facilities require more improvements, she and her husband have created appropriate conditions to carry out this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is a family activity. A neighbor rents them a place, which they improve and it will allow them to raise pigs in better space and health conditions. She currently lives with her husband and three children in Barrio San Jose in Alajuela.   \r\n\t\r\nRight now, she has 50 pigs who are two months old and food for two months. She also predicts the the birth of 40 more pigs which will start a new cycle of production.\r\n\r\nA loan with 3 half-yearly payments is projected to support the purchase of pig feed and development since the development of the pigs is 6 months. Maintaining this level of production, she will have enough income to make the payments for the loan on the respective dates, in addition to a food inventory to continue with the respective cycle.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan allowed her to leave her home and grow from selling small pigs to pigs at their optimal weight. Even though the facilities require more improvements, she and her husband have achieved appropriate conditions for the development of the activity. Right now she has four breeding sows about to give birth and one male in full condition for reproduction and about 50 pigs for which she needs the money for their food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1168833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy food for raising fattened pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela, Barrio San Jose","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-08-25T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-24T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":302114.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":332326.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":365558.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":611.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":672.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":740.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":621.91,"local_amount":307115,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-21T10:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":310021.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339521156},{"amount":234.6,"local_amount":115853.8,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":116950.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391424882},{"amount":1168.49,"local_amount":577031.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":582491.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439997447}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T00:57:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:20:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":464241,"name":"Mab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mab is age 32 and is a married mother living in a rural village of Dambae district.

He is very grateful for the loan as a means of quick access to financing on credit available to hard working people who want to get ahead. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1171172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy small coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2012-08-25T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-24T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yol\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":255430,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058004},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255429.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419850121}],"funded_date":"2012-08-31T19:52:40Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alana Abbitt-McGregor","image":1119620}},{"id":464261,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Maria lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Four years ago he decided to open his own shop because he enjoys the work and the most important thing for him is to be independent. He works together with an assistant from 8 o'clock int the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening. Because the shop is still rather new, he needs to acquire tools to improve his service. This is how he will use the loan for which he has applied.

She works as a teacher at a local school. Furthermore, as a source of additional income for her family, Jipar has been growing crops and raising livestock for the past 13 years, having started her business with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Jipar's herd presently includes 2 cows with offspring, 10 goats and sheep, and 2 horses, while her monthly profits amount to roughly 4,000 som (KGS). Additionally, Jipar works 3.4 hectares of land with barley, potatoes and perennial grasses.\r\n\r\nAs the fall season is particularly active in agriculture, Jipar, like many other countryside residents, needs financial support in order to develop her business. In light of this, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase mares for fattening at a summer pasture. Jipar intends to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business, and also plans to hold her son's wedding next year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1176460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He only works from very early in the day until midday when he then takes a rest. He prefers this way because the sun is strong and he tires very quickly. He spends five days a week in the quarry without interruptions. Bartolo\u2019s work is difficult but his incentive is his five children who he would like to give a stable future.

She gives them good care and a good education while their parents, the majority of whom have few economic resources, are at work. Since she started her child care center, it has grown a lot and this has allowed her to attend to more and more children. It allows her to provide society with a good quality of life. Because of the large number of children who attend, her 20-year-old daughter works with her so that her child care center can offer the highest-quality education possible.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Portia and I am 21 years old. I am studying towards a Bachelor of Business Administration at The Maharishi Institute, and I am from a small township called Emzinoni in Bethal. \r\n\r\nMy father, who was the sole breadwinner in our family, passed away two years ago. I now live with my mother and sister and I am the first person in my family to attend University. My sister has completed her high school certificate. However she cannot pursue further studies due to financial constraints. My hobbies are writing, reciting poems and watching current affairs and talk shows.\r\n \r\nI plan to graduate in 2014 and my dream is to obtain a PhD in Economics, to pay tuition fees for children who come from poor backgrounds and to build a shelter for orphans in my hometown. A Kiva loan will help to ensure my education continues uninterrupted, allowing me to achieve my goals.

Since she opened her store six years ago, the economic situation in her home has improved and she has gradually overcome the constant difficulties that she had.  However, even though her business provides these advantages, she still doesn\u2019t have enough resources to be able to offer her son access to a college education.

All of them live in the town of Osorno. Romina is one of the members: in the picture, she is the second standing person from the left (she is the one wearing a brown top with a black cardigan, with black, untied hair). She has been selling used clothing and various accessories such as pins or stuffed animals for seven years. She says that she does that on Saturdays at a market stall from 10 to 14, and that on the other days of the week she sells beauty products from a catalogue. She receives the merchandise she needs for her business in packages from the city of Santiago, since if she buys wholesale from there, she can benefit from lower prices, which is an advantage. With the loan, Romina will buy house linens such as bedclothes and sheets, as well as seasonal articles that sell well in September, such as kites. One of her goals is to keep growing and have a shop, which would be more welcoming for customers, and hopefully provide her with a better quality of life. Romina lives with her mother and her son, who is four years old. Her dream to have a shop is to prepare for her son growing up and her needing more income to help him have a good life and a good future. She is very grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, because it will help her invest in her business. Concerning her communal bank, she says that there is very good communication within it. Furthermore, the training courses it gives have enabled her to learn new sales strategies and accounting practices.

the capital city of Mongolia. He has been operating his business for three years. He lives with his wife and two children in his ground-floor apartment that has two rooms. He keeps his stock in one of the rooms, and it is not very spacious for storing clothes. Currently, his family is using just one other room, and everything is crowded. His apartment was built in the early 1980s, and it has not undergone renovations in many years. In the winter, it suffers heat loss through its windows and wall corners, and the ceilings are frosted. Usually, he uses a coal or wood-fired stove in his kitchen to warm his home and dry out the moisture inside the rooms. He knows that it is very harmful to the health of his family members and the environment. So, he decided to make some repairs to his apartment.
