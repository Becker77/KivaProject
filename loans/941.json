widowed mother of five children. Out of her five children, three children need her support as they are still in school. \r\n\r\nFor her children's sake, she earns a daily income from a five-hectare plot of crop-planting farmland. She manages to earn about 21,000 KHR per day from the business that she has been with for ten years. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for her business is the shortage of water supply for her paddy field. To overcome this challenge, she leads a group of two female members to seek a new loan; both of them are the sixth-time borrowers.

of the breadwinners in the family. She is a 51-year-old mother of five children. Her two sons have their own employment whilst another three are students and still under her responsibility.  \r\n\r\nFor the children's sake, she and her husband overcame the family's hardships by selling their handmade fish traps. They have been with this business for 15 years and are able to earn almost 15,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day. \r\n\r\nKhorn is new to VisionFund (a Kiva partner), the same as her group members.

Cambodia. \r\n\r\nTo earn his feed, he grows paddy rice and beans as the primary source of income. To add to his income, he also raises cows and catches fish for resale. Having been in this business for seven years, he is able to earn about 39,000 KHR per day. After his daily expenses, he is able to save about 9,000 KHR each day on average. \r\n\r\nBunra joined VisionFund (Kiva's partner)  two cycles ago, and he managed to pay back the entire loans already.

appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nYasmeen is a 24-year-old young woman. She is married and a mother to one son. Her husband is employed and gets a low salary which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nYasmeen wants to live in better home conditions with her family, so she is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture and dinning room furniture in order to improve the living conditions in her house. Taking this loan will offer to Yasmeen and her family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Lica, 39, lives with her spouse and four children, ages 1 through 19, in the town of Soledad where she conducts the business activities with which she generates income to contribute to the growth of her household.  Lica sells a variety of merchandise such as clothing, cosmetics, and perfume.  She started this business when a friend offered her products she sold through specialized catalogues.  This was how Lica began her first business activity, without being affiliated with the organization her friend was in.\r\n\r\nIt went very well for Lica because little by little her business grew, so she began to give loans to new customers and to explore markets on their referrals.  Today, with the income from her business, she supports her household expenses, she has a select clientele, and she grants short-term loans adjusted to her customers' ability to pay.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting her first Kiva loan, although this is her third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the previous loans she has managed to increase her working capital, expand her clientele, and generate more profits all the time.\r\n\r\nHer first Kiva loan will allow her to invest in a greater volume of clothing and cosmetics than she is accustomed to and give continuity to the growth to which she is committed, so that she and her spouse can achieve greater well-being for their family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1172259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, perfume, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lica Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":77686},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":137832},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":141048},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":144339},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":147707},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":151153},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":154680},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":158289},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":161983},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":165762},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":169630},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":173588},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":177639},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":181784},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":186025},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":190366},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":194808},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":285681}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":464813,"name":"Ser","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ser, 31, lives a rural area located in the Dambae district of Kampong Cham province.

Yousef appears in her Kiva profile photo pictured in his grocery store.\r\nYasmeen is a 26-year-old young woman, she is married with no children yet.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Yasmeen's husband has had a grocery store selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family, but not enough to cover their costs.\r\nYasmeen is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request such as dairy products, canned food, sugar and  rice. This will increase sales and increase the family's income, which will enable Yasmeen and her husband to live in better conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is the mother of 2 children, who are 9 and 16 years old. She lives with them in the municipality of Soledad, where she has a business designing and selling women\u2019s clothing. She started this business 2 years ago, selling shoes to her friends. However, like a good designer, she got the idea to create a brand of clothing. So, she began designing articles of clothing, which small businesses make for her and which she later sells herself. Her main lines of designed products are women\u2019s clothing. However, she also sells shoes that she buys to resell by offering them on credit to her customers, according to their ability to repay. Her dream of prosperity is to open a store in her own house where she can sell her designs and shoes, items that her customers will find more accessible and in a comfortable atmosphere. She currently uses social networks for her advertizing strategy, and she combines this with visits to the homes of potential customers. Gina has come to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for her first Kiva loan. She will use it to buy raw materials such as fabrics, accessories, and also shoes that her customers have ordered from her and that she took note of when doing pre-sales.

Having been with this business for ten years, she is able to earn about 46,000 KHR per day.\n\nPhoery has taken out loans with VisionFund for two cycles and completely paid back each entire loan. The past loans have enabled her to maintain good living conditions especially in keeping her children in school and managing her business well.

However, drought is still the main challenge for her business.

She started her business by buying a sewing machine with her own funds, after having been a victim of a natural catastrophe - the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002. Later on, she received a loan from the MFI Hekima to augment her funds. She has just completed 19 loan cycles.\r\n\r\nKavira sets up her workshop at the central market of Virunga.

The paperwork is fast and convenient for her needs. Beside lacking education fees, she has other difficulties such as not having study tools, study materials, and transportation.

living in Khoost. Her meager pension is simply not enough, and so she earns extra money cleaning a store and renting a room to part-time students that come to study in her city. \r\n\r\nMariya has turned to Kiva for a loan because she can no longer avoid getting \u0430 new bed and new furniture for her kitchen. She has had health problems for some time, and it is becoming more and more difficult for her to sleep on her old, uncomfortable bed.

located in the Zaporozhskaya region of Ukraine.  His children are already grown and they help him on the farm.  Viktor has a large business, which includes a greenhouse and a breeding complex for pigs.  He has been in this line of work for 12 years.\r\n\r\nViktor plans to use his Kiva loan of 20,000 hryvnas to invest in grain for his animals.  He was offered a purchase of 10 tons of grain at a good price, which is why he needs this loan.  Very active and dedicated, Viktor is always trying to reach his goals.  He had a stroke of good luck 12 years ago, when he was able to purchase a greenhouse at a very reasonable price.  The greenhouse was on a large plot of land, so he immediately made plans to build a breeding complex.  Today, Viktor's dream has come true and his business brings him a good income.

In particular, they have 2 hectares of apple garden, 2 hectares of owned and rented agricultural land where different kinds of vegetables and cereal crops are grown: tomatoes, garlic, onion, haricot, wheat. David sells his produce at the local open market. He is also successfully involved in an animal husbandry business and has 2 milking cows, 4 calves and 2 pigs. David produces cheese and pork and sells locally. He is a very hardworking man, with rich experience in his work.\r\n\r\nDavid requested a loan to purchase his rented land, where he has an apple garden. He will be able to make the land private.

This line of business brings profit when you have sufficient recharge cards. However, without sufficient capital she does not manage to earn a sizeable profit. She keeps running out of stock since she needs to [sell] everything in order to replenish her stock. As a result, her customers are disappointed and turn to competitors.

With this loan, he is going to buy fertilizer for his farmland and use a portion of it to support his children\u2019s education.

Jenny trabaja sola en su proceso hace rascadores, camas, colchonetas, arena sanitaria, para gatos;sus negociaciones las realiza telefonicamente o por internet; En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva con el cual comprar\u00e1   a un mayor volumen y de contado, insumos para la cotizaci\u00f3n de art\u00edculos que permiten el aseo de los perros  y de los gatos; el \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n es que cuenta con una clientela fija y un enorme potencial de crecimiento, porque es un negocio con muy poca competencia. Su meta mas adelante es exportar sus productos sanitarios y mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para lograr mas rap\u00eddamente su crecimiento y esto es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos como bentonita sodica en mayor volumen entre otros materiales,  para lograr tener un stock que aumente sus ventas mediante el impacto de su promoci\u00f3n. \n","en":"Jenny, 32, lives in the city of Bogot\u00e1.  She is the owner of a micro firm that manufactures and sells pet potties, especially for cats and dogs.  She started the business in 2010 and the business started to take off in 2011.  It\u2019s not a very common business but it has great growth potential which is what drew her attention to it; competition is scarce.  Her main customers are pet owners and they buy from her regularly because she does high quality work.\r\n\r\nJenny works alone and her process includes making scratchers, beds, bed pads and kitty litter.  She does her negotiating either by phone or via Internet.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan to buy larger amounts of supplies for cash so that she can get better prices for items used in cat and dog grooming.  \r\n\r\nHer investment will succeed because she has a regular clientele, enormous growth potential and because her business has very little competition.  Her goal for later on is to export her sanitary products and her greatest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to quickly attain growth which is precisely the reason for the Kiva loan request, the first financing she\u2019s had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy supplies, like sodium bentonite in larger amounts, among others to have sufficient stock available so that sales will increase as a result of the impact of her advertising.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1172383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

flutes, panpipes, guitars, maracas and drums. He would like to purchase the materials he needs, such as wood and bamboo, to increase production. Dionisio has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. \r\n\r\nThis is his story:\r\n\"When I was eight years old, I began to learn this craft from my father. I started making instruments just for fun. I make most traditional Peruvian musical instruments, including percussion such as bombo and tinya drums, stringed instruments such as charango guitars, and wind instruments like the quena panpipe and zampo\u00f1a flute. I use wood and bamboo and colorful cotton threads to give each instrument a traditional Cuzco style. Thanks to hard work and my great customers, my children are able to get a higher education. Three of them want to follow their own career, while the other three want to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you so much for your help. I'm just getting out of a difficult economic situation and this micro-credit seems like a gift from heaven! With it, I hope to be able to continue crafting instruments and increase sales.

In the future she hopes to have a studio with several industrial machines and operators so she can apply for contracts from major companies and thus improve finances in her household and provide her daughter a better quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1172438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread and a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigail Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1053.21,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.96,"local_amount":76.38,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":77.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340503},{"amount":80.53,"local_amount":78.9,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096912},{"amount":83.05,"local_amount":81.36,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331267},{"amount":84.26,"local_amount":82.56,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":84.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939907},{"amount":86.74,"local_amount":84.98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":86.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072328},{"amount":88.17,"local_amount":86.38,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":88.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318683},{"amount":90.18,"local_amount":88.35,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013426},{"amount":92.97,"local_amount":91.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":92.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453785},{"amount":94.92,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":94.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459629},{"amount":296.22,"local_amount":290.21,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":296.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373087950}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T17:23:29Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:14:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":465066,"name":"Tamaraneh Traders Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kadiatu is the leader of this group of entrepreneurs.

hopes to purchase materials such as clay, minerals, and glazes.\r\n\r\nChecuan has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I'm from the state of Guanajuato, and I recall being attracted to ceramics from a very young age. By the time I was 16, I started going to my godfather's workshop. I would just go there to visit and admire his work, but I had no intention of earning a livelihood from it. Eventually, my first assignment was at the potter's wheel, and during those first three years I became enamored with the work as I learned more and more with each passing day. Thinking about my future when I was 19, I decided that one day I would like to set up my own workshop. I now feel I have established myself in the world of ceramics and see it as my duty to teach others who hope to one day have their own ceramic workshop like me. Being associated with Novica means a lot to us. It makes us feel proud to know that people from every corner of the world will appreciate our work. I am thankful to the Lord, as well as to those who graced me with their teachings and confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate the opportunity for growth through this microcredit. You are feeding our creativity so that we can continue to bring our ideas to life in ceramics. You are also making it possible for us to buy natural materials and take responsibility for our impact on the environment.

All the rest of our colors are a result of combining fibers and threads from these three when weaving the fabric.

province, Cambodia. Thorn is a 33-year-old, married mother of four children. She has three daughters and one son, all of whom are dependent on her and still in school. <p>\r\n\r\nThe main source of her family's income is from rice-farming, though her husband supplements the family\u2019s income by working for others for a fee. They have been in these businesses for almost ten years. Their current businesses allow them to earn approximately 20,000 KHR per day and to save approximately 4,000 KHR per day for their future needs. Drought is the main challenge for her rice-farming business. <p>\r\n\r\nThorn has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles and proudly explains that she repaid the previous loans. The other team member has been with VisionFund for four loan cycles. The previous loans have helped her better support her family. Now she is leading her group of two to ask for a loan with VisionFund. Thorn will use her portion of the loan proceeds to buy fertilizers for her farmland and to pay fees for a water pump so that her rice plants can be harvested. She hopes this loan will enable her to grow more and better rice than before, which will in turn enable her to generate more income, improve her family's standard of living, and pay for her children's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1177157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers and to pay for water for her rice-farming business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thorn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":233300},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":233300},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":233400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":233300,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":237382.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118789},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":233300,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":237382.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941085},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046524},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":133400,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":135734.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837759}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T01:34:52Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":465276,"name":"Nilfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilfa is married  and she is a very hard working entrepreneur.

He began as a street vendor several years ago. He chose this work because there were few opportunities for employment. With his sales, he managed to acquire a stall in the city market, so he no longer has to make rounds. He usually works by himself, but he hires an assistant at an hourly wage when there is a fair.

Her idea is to continue growing and always have a source of income to support her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1172918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choloma, Cortes.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2012-08-27T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-26T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1360.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1428.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1475.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1524.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1575.74},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1628.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1738.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1796.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1856.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2014.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1360.54,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1392.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308476523},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":1428.11,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1462.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315477937},{"amount":77.48,"local_amount":1475.72,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1510.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323083302},{"amount":80.06,"local_amount":1524.91,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1561.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332035047},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":1575.74,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1613.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339605720},{"amount":85.49,"local_amount":1628.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1666.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154696},{"amount":88.33,"local_amount":1682.54,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1722.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356559332},{"amount":91.28,"local_amount":1738.62,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364614146},{"amount":94.32,"local_amount":1796.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1839.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373194612},{"amount":303.92,"local_amount":5788.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5926.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382006643}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T16:33:46Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:25:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":465337,"name":"Teodora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teodora is 43 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nTeodora works hard to provide for her family.
