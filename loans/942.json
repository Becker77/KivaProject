He earns a living by selling junior clothing and men's underwear at a local market. Vladimir rents market stalls as he does not have his own yet. He's been working in this area for 5 years.\r\n\r\nVladimir hopes to use a 5,000-UAH loan from Kiva to purchase an additional batch of junior clothing before the start of the new school year in September.

He lives in the Ganta area and is married with 3 children aged 5 to 15. They all live at home and attend school. For the past 10 years he has been running a general shop. David has requested this loan to purchase more batteries, soap, rice, toothpaste, etc, in order to turn his business into a bigger one. \r\n\r\nThe problem he\u2019s faced with is his small amount of capital.

He is married and the father of a family, and has been engaged in business for the last few years. He manages his brother's business by bringing a refrigerated truck to Mali with a chauffeur to purchase fish; his brother pays him 75,000 francs CFA per month. \r\n\r\nOn each trip Mandiaye also purchases fish for his own business account, and sometimes bags of onions which he comes back to Senegal to resell. Each trip earns him an average of 50,000 francs CFA which allows him to provide for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nMandiaye is requesting a loan of 200,000 francs CFA for purchasing fish which he plans to resell in Senegal. He hopes one day to have his own vehicle and to go to Mali on his own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1179297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fish to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-08-28T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-27T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mandiaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":41948.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315889148},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":16508,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-23T09:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":17312.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323610117},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":20321,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":21311.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331715934},{"amount":46.34,"local_amount":23171,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":24299.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339636168},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":20974.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356753345},{"amount":105.23,"local_amount":52617,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55180.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373041443},{"amount":54.77,"local_amount":27383,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":28717.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381832135}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T21:21:09Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:58:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":463813,"name":"Hannah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah is 27 years old and lives in Buchanan.

More recently she was informed about the micro-loans granted by IMF H\u00e9kima. She was consequently granted a first loan of $50 to boost her business. The profits from her business are used for savings, as well as for her children's food and schooling. Meanwhile, she has just been granted her seventh loan. During this period, this customer has seen her business prosper. She has thus decided to increase her loan for this new cycle and will use it to buy two sacks of beans.

five female members who are all married, is a solidarity group involved in agriculture. These women grow millet and peanuts on two shared fields, and during each rainy season they produce a significant amount, the sale of which provides them with substantial income.

He also has chickens but only for his own consumption though he does relate that if he has any unforeseen need he sells them in the market.

The city is 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago, the capital of Chile.  On the outskirts are a series of lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) and a very striking native flora and fauna concentrated in nearby nature parks.  It's worth pointing out that 50% of Chile's Mapuche Indians live in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7300,"image":{"id":1173949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is requesting a loan for 4,000,000 IDR from TLM, which she will use to purchase flour, rice flour, margarine, eggs, cheese, and other ingredients.

","en":"Rakhmat is a middle-age man, a good family man and a father of adult children.  He is a welder by trade and is currently involved in manufacturing iron gates.  Previously, when he first came to our organization, he and his sons were involved in selling food products and clothing outside the city limits.  They had their own truck, which they used to deliver merchandise to districts.  With time and age, Rakhmat got tired of traveling to distant districts and decided to get involved in a business in his own trade.  Currently, he manufactures gates and fences at a leased factory for sale.  His products are also ordered for the districts and rural areas, and his sons sell them, using their truck.  Rakhmat has been obtaining loans from our organization for over two years and has used each loan to purchase raw materials.  He does not complain of life and earns his bread proudly, despite his age and his children's

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 20 years, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kyzylgul's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring and 1.4 hectares of land, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs.  The monthly profit from the business amounts to about 5,000 som (KGS).  Also, Kyzylgul grows berries and fruits in her garden, which brings in a small harvest primarily for her family's needs.  In order to further develop her business, Kyzylgul requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows in order to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued business development and wants to make cosmetic repairs at home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1179180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy dairy cows in order to increase milk volumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sosnovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-08-28T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-27T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kyzylgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5799},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5944},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6093},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6245},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6401},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6561},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6725},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6893},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7066},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7242},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7423},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7608}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.04,"local_amount":5799,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5829.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095669},{"amount":128.17,"local_amount":5944,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-28T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5974.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329972},{"amount":131.38,"local_amount":6093,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6124.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938752},{"amount":134.66,"local_amount":6245,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6277.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071227},{"amount":138.02,"local_amount":6401,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6434.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459655},{"amount":205.23,"local_amount":9518,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":9567.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012413},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":3768,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3787.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754775},{"amount":148.63,"local_amount":6893,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-28T08:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458788},{"amount":152.36,"local_amount":7066,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7102.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862921},{"amount":156.15,"local_amount":7242,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7279.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631466},{"amount":324.11,"local_amount":15031,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15109.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495343}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T04:35:26Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":465574,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua  cooks  'banku' (fermented maize balls) and 'Ga-kenkey' for sale.

He is married and has four children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past two years, Jackson has been working hard to manage his grocery store, where he sells beans, maize and g-nuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jackson has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce like rice and posho, and will help Jackson to generate greater profits and help pay school fees. Jackson hopes that in the future he will be able to open up another store. \r\n\r\nJackson is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Jackson who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1177591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

two. She acts as the main provider for her family. For 30 years, she has worked in crop farming and animal husbandry, a business she started with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, today Aichurok's farm has two calving dairy cows and five heads of sheep and goats, and her animal husbandry brings in profits of about 3,000 som (KGS) a month. Aichurok also works 1.8 hectacres of land, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs and grasses.

Their school\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for making the repayment on their behalf.\r\n\r\nOsman is the leader of this group of teachers. The 37 year-old is a native of Freetown.

She\u2019s been selling nacatamales [Nicaraguan style tamales], ice and soft-drinks for the last four years.  She\u2019s from the capital, Managua.  At the age of 25 she started selling chicha, a traditional beverage made from sweet corn.  Then she started selling food and after that nacatamales, soft-drinks and ice which is her current business.  On Saturdays and Sundays she sells hot-dogs and sandwiches.  The women in her family help her make the nacatamales.  She sells them at home and at a school where she sells food to the teachers.  Her husband helps her economically since he works selling clothes.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Estela would like to set up business somewhere other than in part of her home because she wants to expand the business, multiply sales and equip the space where she sells her product.

She has two children, with one of them currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Mercy has been working hard to manage her small business, where she sells skirts, tops, trousers, and dresses. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mercy has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more dresses and skirts in specific colors and cuts.  It will help Mercy to generate greater profits and increase the range of her inventory to attract customers. \r\n\r\nMercy hopes that in the future she will be able to open another boutique. \r\n\r\nMercy is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Mercy who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but whose businesses have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1177626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He began his business in Feb. 2008. Jeffrey describes NuVision as an investment company because, within his business, he takes under-performing apartment complexes and makes them profitable again.  \r\n\r\nJeffrey\u2019s job is to find what the problems are and fix them. He said the majority of the time, a major problem is that a complex owner is new and does not fully understand how to run a business, therefore, tenants may take advantage of the situation. However, Jeffrey is experienced in his field as he previously worked with foreclosed homes.  Jeffrey learned how to successfully make under-performing establishments into profitable places through a combination of self study, a mentor and some trial and error.\r\n\r\nThe father of three decided to become an entrepreneur to have more time for his family and ability to create his own schedule. Before working with his management company, he worked with an aircraft company in Los Angeles along with an apartment builder who Jeffrey began networking with to learn how the business works. Jeffrey also had a friend who was an established real estate broker and advised him throughout the beginning of his new business.\r\n\r\nCurrently Jeffrey works alone and has not been able to successfully bid on an establishment so he works with partners who are in charge of placing the cash down payment to secure a bid. When the bid is confirmed, the partner will then receive a percentage of Jeffrey\u2019s profits. Their responsibility is providing the funds. Thereafter, Jeffrey reviews the building, fixes any problems that need to be fixed and offers financial management. \u201cOur partnerships are just to secure a bid. They don\u2019t have to do anything else,\u201d he said. With the help of his partners, Jeffrey manages four buildings. \r\n\r\nThe website Jeffrey is in the process of building will list potential properties and make it easier to obtain partners.

he was a child and he watched his father, who owned a repair shop. Raul later took courses to enhance his knowledge. Raul followed his father\u2019s path as he moved from Chihuahua to El Paso, Texas and earned American citizenship. \r\n\r\nTaking after him, Raul worked with his father, who began his repair shop in their hometown in 1980. At the beginning of 2001, Raul came to the United States to assist his father at the business. Upon his father\u2019s death, Raul took over the business. \r\n\r\nCurrently 44, Raul employs four people. After finding out about Accion Texas Inc. through meeting his loan officer at a business resource meeting, Raul decided to apply for a loan. Upon the approval of a loan from Accion, Raul said he plans to use the funds to purchase materials and equipment, and offer better services for his customers. Without the loan, Raul would have to pay 100 percent upfront for the equipment.  \r\n\r\nJust as his father worked all week, Raul continues to keep the shop open Monday through Saturday and to provide for his five children.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlah\" symbolises someone with a good heart and good practices. The EIG reached a membership number of 300 in 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to carry out their businesses including: agricultural and halieutic production, general import-export activities, transportation services, industrial activities, craftwork, construction, breeding, mining exploitation, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and culture, publishing, woodwork, public utility services, representation, processing fish products, farming, spare parts sales, glass-making, baking and the provision of various services. The EIG also aims to consolidate ties of friendship and solidarity between its members, to enable them to acquire the material means and necessary financing to allow them to develop their revenue-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages linked to the EIG. It was with this in mind that a memorandum of understanding was signed between the EIG and UIMCEC to benefit the EIG members at a national level. The first phase was carried out on a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\n\"Makarimal Akhlakh groupe 1\" is one of the EIG subgroups. It unites 10 people who go to the same market where they conduct their revenue-generating activities. They are represented by Marame (the woman dressed in pink who has her hand raised). She is married and lives in Senegal and works in retail, selling fabrics and clothing. She also sews. The revenues she earns through her business enables her to cover her children's schooling expenses and also to save money, with the ambition of one day, in about 3 years time, buying a store and
