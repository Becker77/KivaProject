of eight children.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in fattening up and breeding livestock since 1979.  The business, started practically from zero, today, thanks to Jamalbubu's persistence and hard work, contains four cattle, twenty small livestock and two horses, and yields about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sale of milk products.  The earnings from the business allowed her to provide education for her children, who set up their lives and now live separately.  In order to further develop her business, Jamalbubu requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings into a continued business growth and wants to help her youngest son to build a house this year.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1179294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She\u2019s a widow and has a son.  She\u2019s a merchant; she owns a grocery store that she opened when her husband died.  \r\n\r\nShe started out selling frozen treats and beans.  In time, her customers requested dairy products and when she saw that business was increasing she decided to invest in the products her customers requested the most. She vows that her customers are the most important because they are the ones that help her increase business and today she has a grocery store that\u2019s been in operation for about four and a half years.  It\u2019s located in her house and her son and daughter-in-law help her in it.  She also gets some economic support from her widow\u2019s pension.  She hopes to extend the business and acquire more customers from the surrounding area and turn her small grocery store into a variety store.\r\n\r\nMarlene has requested this loan to buy products like basic grains, snacks, dairy products, vegetables, oil, cleaning supplies and everything necessary to sell and stock her store.  She says that the loan will help her because she will have more products to offer customers and the business will grow little by little.

Kitenge sells food from her home. She began this business with a loan from IMF Hekima; she has completed 7 loan cycles with their microfinancing program.\r\n\r\nKitenge faces many challenges to her business, especially in credit selling, such as facing a loss from currency exchange since she conducts her business in the national currency, but purchases her stock in the currency of the tariff rates (dollars). Additionally, there is instability due to the armed groups in the more rural areas.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will allow Kitenge to purchase two bags of manioc (cassava) flour.

Ramiz has 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who taught him how to look after cattle. He receives 80 AZN financial support from the government monthly, but this is too low to cover his family's needs.\n\nRamiz usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in five or six months, and resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.

Today he distributes his product to twelve salespeople who have ice cream carts in the city. The basic supplies and materials Wilson buys on credit from an ice cream producer. He works from 9am until noon and then from 2pm until 6pm or until he finishes his work. He works from Monday to Sunday. His goal is to increase the carts he supplies with delicious ice cream to more than fifty in the city.  In the future he would like his own home. Each day he would like to improve the welfare of his family, which includes his wife and two daughters, ages four and five. This is his first loan with KIVA, through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan he will buy ice cream and carts in order to begin to reach his goals. This investment will be successful, as he knows the market since he has been involved with it for six years.

Gansukh, 51, is a taxi driver who services the districts of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He started his business in 1997, and since then, he has been operating his business nonstop. And he has had a lot of permanent customers in the past years. He lives with his family in a house in ger district, a slum district in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nIn winter, he uses a coal fired furnace to heat his home and it emits too much smoke and harmful toxic substances into the air. Therefore, he decided to replace it with a smokeless stove, which is made with modern technology. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters, where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main causes of Mongolian air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars on the natural gas.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Mr. Gansukh is taking will be used to cover the cost of the new smokeless stove in his house for reducing the pollution in the air.

She lives in Akhmeta District with her husband Soso and her 72-year-old father-in-law. Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Irma\u2019s father-in-law and the small income earned by Soso, working as an agricultural worker in the village. It totals 250 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to restart the family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Irma will purchase a horse. Soso and Irma will go to the local forest and bring wood from the forest on the horse. They will sell the wood in the village and earn an income. The wood is mainly used by the village population in ovens to heat the houses and cook. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income of the family by 150 laris, which will mean a 60% increase. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1179022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a horse for the transportation of wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Matani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-08-30T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-29T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":82.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.62,"local_amount":61.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":63.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209940},{"amount":45.97,"local_amount":73.55,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440708},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":74.88,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":77.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045758},{"amount":48.72,"local_amount":77.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181750},{"amount":49.73,"local_amount":79.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565623},{"amount":51.27,"local_amount":82.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":84.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115201},{"amount":53.86,"local_amount":86.18,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":88.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860689},{"amount":54.49,"local_amount":87.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":89.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569509},{"amount":235.54,"local_amount":376.86,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":388.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968157}],"funded_date":"2012-08-30T08:21:45Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:08:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":466219,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel has been in farming for three years, doing dairy, maize and vegetable farming in his rural home area in Kitale, Western Kenya.

Her house is made of cement, but has no piped water; neither does it have electricity. She has a store in her house in which she stocks and sells makuti (thatching materials made from palm fronds). Once she came up with the idea of this business, she gradually made it into a reality thanks to her perseverance and effort. She works by herself every day without a fixed schedule, because she also must care for her family. She feels satisfied with her achievements because she has gotten ahead on her own, and this has helped her to gain the respect of her friends and neighbors who see in her an example to pass on to others. Riziki is requesting a loan to purchase more makuti for her store so that she can increase her sales. She expects to do this without any difficulties, and to continue working without any problems.

He was aware that as a retired man, the income generated would not fully cover the whole cost of living. It encouraged him to initiate two businesses: a rented house and a kiosk business. \r\n\r\nEven though Melkianus already has his own businesses he is still struggling to cover his children educational expenses. This situation then led Melkianus to improve his business by adding more stock to sell in his kiosk. To do so, Melkianus is requesting loan from TLM amounting to IDR 8,000,000. The loan will enable him to add more goods to his kiosk i.e. rice, sugar, coffee, wheat flour, mobile phone recharges etc. Melkianus is hoping that the loan will help him to improve his business.

She has a 5-year-old child who is already in school.\r\n\r\nClaudine has been selling clothes for one year at a local market.  Because of the high quality and the reasonable price of the clothes that she sells, she has built a large customer base.\r\n\r\nAlthough this type of activity is usually profitable, the fact that Claudine's capital is very small forces her to buy only retail quantities, which doesn't bring much profits.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is thanks to this activity that she manages to feed her small family.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan for the purchase of a bale of clothes.  This loan will allow her to increase her sales, and therefore her profit margin.\r\n\r\nPart of her profits will be used to meet her needs, while the rest will be reinvested in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1182282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a bale of clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Kribi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-08-30T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-29T09:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline Claudine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20851},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21604},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22359},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23113},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23869},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24622},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25377},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26131},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26886},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27639},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28395},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29154}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":20851,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":20875.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306532},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":21604,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":21629.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914872},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":22359,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":22385.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047106},{"amount":44.3,"local_amount":23113,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":23140.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436901},{"amount":45.75,"local_amount":23869,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":23897.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989321},{"amount":47.19,"local_amount":24622,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":24650.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622933},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":25377,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25406.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437085},{"amount":264.89,"local_amount":138205,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138367.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842148}],"funded_date":"2012-08-30T12:45:05Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":466269,"name":"Poni Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poni is a thirty-three-year-old businesswoman who lives in Juba.

She lives in Ouagadougou, where she runs a store selling beauty products, \u201cpagnes\u201d (traditional wrap-around cloth), shoes and, recently, energy products (energy-efficient cookstoves, gas cooking rings, solar-powered lamps). To increase her sales of gas stoves, Gilberte would like to add a gas refill service to her business. In fact, without this service her customers are hesitant to invest in a stove, as they do not know where they can refill their gas bottles, and sometimes have to travel several kilometers in the city to find gas. \r\n\r\nGilberte has requested this loan in addition to a loan she received in July, and she plans to use the money to develop her energy product sales business. This second loan will allow her to buy 25 bottles of gas (five 12-kilo bottles, 15 6-kilo bottles and five 3-kilo bottles), as well as to buy the first gas refill for these 25 bottles. \r\n\r\nThanks to this diversification in her business, Gilberte will be able to increase her sales of gas cooking rings and her income. She will therefore be able to expand her store and buy a freezer, which she will use to sell juices and cold water.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1182446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She works at the business from 7am until 6 pm, 7 days per week.  Her business is the only source of income she has. Mariama says that her major challenge is insufficient capital to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nMariam has requested a loan in order to buy more local foodstuffs like palm oil, rice, beans, gari and nut oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to start a savings account and educate her children. In the future, she wants to expand this business. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1179141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more local foodstuffs like palm oil, rice, beans, gari and nut oil.

She is widowed with seven children between the ages of 18 years and 30 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Isha established her business within a busy market area. Before her husband died, the couple ran a farm, but after his death she had no one to help her with the farming. So she started a business to generate income to support her family. She works at the business twelve hours per day, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the costs of transportation.\r\n\r\nIsha requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, gari (tapioca) and coal. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her children's health and improve her standard of living. In the future, Isha plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1179160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has three children: 12, 15 and 17 years old. They go to the local school. The main source of income for the family is agriculture. In particular, they own four milk cows, 12 calves and sell cheese locally. Also they have a plot of land where potatoes are grown. Part of the harvested product is sold on the local market. \r\n\r\nWith the loan received from Credo, Nugzar plans to repair his cattle-shed and purchase an additional milking cow. He plans to expand the dairy farm through adding additional cows, but the existing cattle-shed doesn\u2019t allow him to implement this plan. Once his cattle-shed is larger, he will expand his animal husbandry business and the family\u2019s income from the sale of dairy products will increase. He will reinvest the additional earnings to expand his agricultural enterprise and make it more profitable.

The items come from a neighboring country.\r\n\r\nWith his investment he will manage to increase his stock and achieve an increase in his profits, which is one of his goals.

He lives in Tskaltubo district with wife Maya and three children (15, 12 and 3 years old). His elder children go to school. Maya is a housewife. Beglar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to re-start his agricultural business, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has a milk cow, dairy products of which are mainly consumed by the family members. Beglar grows greens on a family-owned plot of land. Harvested greens are sold locally. The average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a five member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBeglar requested a loan from Credo to re-start-up a greenhouse of vegetables; Beglar used to have a greenhouse, but it was old and was destroyed. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Beglar will purchase materials to construct a greenhouse.

The dairy products are mainly used by the family members and the greens are sold on the local open market. \r\n\r\nLevan requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a start-up greenhouse, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe average monthly income of the family is 500 GEL. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLevan requested a loan from Credo to start a greenhouse. His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Levan will purchase materials for greenhouse construction. He will construct a greenhouse and grow cucumbers, tomatoes and greens during the whole year. It will increase the income of the family and their income won\u2019t have a seasonal character any more.

She is a trader in one of the capital's markets, where she has been selling game and fresh fish for around ten years. Her significant experience, the quality of her products and, above all, her prices have created a certain trust between her and her customers, which has led to an ever-increasing demand.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIvane requested a loan from Credo to start-up a business trading fruits and vegetables. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Ivane will purchase seasonal fruits, mainly watermelons and melons, as well as peaches and pears. He will sell the products in Kutaisi, the largest town in West Georgia. In fall he will trade with seasonal citrus and grapes and in winter\/spring with seasonal vegetables. So he will earn income each season. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family. It will allow them to improve their living

Her main challenge is the difficulty of getting the used clothing from the store to the local market where she sells. She started this business with a little amount from her friend and she learned the business from her mother. What she likes about this business is that she is responsible for herself and is proud of herself. She has requested this loan to purchase more used clothing for her business.

He is a retailer, and has a ready-to-wear clothing store in a neighborhood of the capital which he has managed for seven years. His warm welcome, creativity, good clothing advice and experience have enabled him to build up a considerable customer base. \r\n\r\nThe growth of Samuel\u2019s customer base has brought problems, as he cannot meet demand because his capital is so low. This means he has to go and buy stock every weekend on a retail basis, and then return and resell this stock.

She lives in the village of Kvishilori. Marina is a widow and lives with her 18-year-old son. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a pig. Marina sells on average 10 piglets per year in the village. The monthly income of the family is 200 GEL, which is even less than the minimum living wage estimated in the country. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marina will purchase a milk cow and a calf. She will place the domestic animals in an old cattle-shed located in their yard. Marina will produce cheese from the milk and sell it in the village.

This is 39-year-old Joseph from Moriba Town, in the southern area of Bo. He is married with three children between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. His children attend school. Joseph left school at secondary level and started doing hard labor.\r\n\r\nJoseph runs an electrical appliance store, where he sells extension cords, electrical cable, sockets, lamp holders and bulbs. He has been running this business for ten years. He works at the business 13 hours a day and seven days a week. His other source of income comes from his wife who is a business woman. Joseph says that the main challenge to his business is insufficient capital to expand his business.\r\n\r\nJoseph has requested a loan in order to buy more extension cords, electrical cable, sockets, lamp holders and bulbs. The extra income from this loan will allow him to educate his children and improve his family's welfare. In the future, he plans to open a bigger store. He thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1179400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical

The term \u201cMakarimal Akhlakh\u201d denotes a person has a good heart and does the right thing. Since 2009, the number of group members has reached 300. The goal is to unify group members helping them with their work:  farming, fishing, general retail, import\/export, transportation, industry, crafts, construction, animal husbandry, mining, [fishing], arts and culture, printing and woodwork, public services, sales, processing seafood and produce, retailing spare parts, ice cream production, bakeries and providing various services. The GIE also aims to foster friendship and solidarity among its members so as to help them acquire the material and financial means necessary for their businesses and to take advantage of the benefits afforded by GIE. It is in this spirit that an agreement has been signed between GIE and UIMCEC, to benefit GIE members at the national level. The launching phase uses a sample of 120 active members divided into 12 groups with 10 people in each.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh-group 3 is composed of 10 GIE members who are in the same line of business. They are represented by Mrs. Marietou B.  She is a divorced woman who has been selling fabric, sewing supplies and other miscellaneous items for over 10 years. She starts her work day at 9 AM and finishes at 5 PM. She is a member of UIMCEC and is seeking a credit to replenish her stock by buying fabric and miscellaneous items. The growth of her revenue will allow her to cover the cost of her children\u2019s tuition and also  save money. Her dream is to become a large-scale entrepreneur and travel to   big industrial countries around the world to conduct import-export transactions.

lives in the Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is married and has eight children, of whom two attend school. She owns a retail shop and a green grocery, businesses she has been operating for 12 years. She also owns a farming business where she earns a salary. She learned about Milango through a friend who invited her to our group, and she joined with the idea of accessing credit to improve her business operations. The challenges she faces include price fluctuations and inflation. Dama is applying for a loan for 22,000 Kenya shillings to buy vegetables and cooking oil. She will add the extra income made possible by this loan to her savings to improve the living standard of her family. Her plan for the future is to own a wholesale shop and be a supplier.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1179620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
