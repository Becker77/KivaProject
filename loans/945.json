He is single and has one child. For the past 6 years, Amos has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells rice, maize flour and dry beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Amos has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like milk, bread, sugar and soap for resale, and will help Amos to generate greater profits and improve his family standards of living. Amos hopes that in the future he will be able to have the best stocked shop in the center and own a mini supermarket. \r\n\r\nAmos is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Amos who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1182420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is married, with eight children. Her eldest is 23 years old, and her youngest is 3. \r\n\r\nIt is quite a challenge for her to provide for her children while she relies on hog raising and a food-vending business for an income. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy feed for her hogs and ingredients like vegetables, cooking oil, soy sauce, and other seasonings.

She's married and a mother to three children. Olma is very hard working and driven. She began sewing in her childhood. She would sew dresses for women and girls in her village after school in order to support her family. She continued to sew after marriage while helping her husband raise cattle. She would fatten the cattle and her husband would sell the meat so that they could feed their children. This has been their livelihood for the past twenty years. \r\n\r\nOlma wants her children to receive a good education.

He is the only financial supporter for his family.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, Tomor has been selling and transporting goods with his truck. The services he has been offering to locals are in demand in the region where he serves. Through these services, he has been able to build a little house for his family. Recently, his truck broke down and now needs repairing. This is the reason why he is requesting a loan from Kiva and hopes that lenders will be supporting him. In return, his promise is that he will pay back the loan just like he has in the past the other three

She lives in the Kaspi district with her parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nEsma runs her animal husbandry business. She owns a milk cow, a calf and four pigs. She milks the cow every day and produces dairy products which are sold locally. She sells piglets as well.

I am 20 years old and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration at the Maharishi Institute. \r\n\r\nI am the firstborn from the family of six. My father is the breadwinner in my family, and we are all in school. We also live with a cousin whose parents have passed away. My hobbies include reading and writing. \r\n\r\nAfter graduation I hope to work in the Finance Department in a company, as finance is the field I am most interested in. Afterwards, I would like to own my own company, so that I can support my family. I think in these days we are living in, opportunity comes to those who are educated and there are no shortcuts to success. Education is the only doorway to ensuring a worthwhile living.

I am studying for  a Bachelor of Business Administration at the Maharishi Institute.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents are deceased and I am living with my grandmother, my brother, my cousin and my nephew. The household is run on the monthly pension grant that my grandmother receives from the government.  I fully depend on my grandmother for my school expenses. In my spare time I read newspapers, listen to music, play soccer, do graffiti and gardening.\r\n\r\nI plan to graduate by 2014. I'd like to buy a house and bring financial liberation to my family. I hope to be employable after graduation, and I hope to have the knowledge and confidence to start my own business. My long-term goal after graduation is to enrol in an MBA program and start an NGO (Non Governmental Organisation).

My hobbies are reading novels and newspapers, watching television, especially cricket, and listening to music.\r\n\r\nMy father died 10 years ago. My mother is now remarried and we are not in contact. My grandmother has been taking care of me since I was a child, and my dream is to get a good job to provide for her. I am from a very poor family, so any help would be highly appreciated. I just want to change my family's condition for the better.\r\n\r\nI plan to graduate in 2014, and afterwards I would like to get an MBA and have a family. Education is important to me as it is self-liberating, and the only thing that can bring hope to the hopeless. It is why I haven't given up on my dreams of obtaining a degree and making good. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":866.09,"image":{"id":1182653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for tuition fees and living expenses at the Maharishi Institute.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Nokuthula, I am 27 years old and I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Johannesburg. I  live with my grandparents in a small township called Leandra, in the province of Mpumalanga. My mother is unemployed and does not live with us, so my grandparents have raised me on their pension fund. In my spare time, I like listening to music and volunteering at community halls, helping to organise youth activities. \r\n\r\nMy hope is to find a job that is going to help me utilise the skills that I have acquired in school; a job that is going to challenge me so that I can grow as a person. In the long run, I would like to contribute as much as possible to the growth of the Maharishi Institute. I want to open a Transcendental Meditation Centre in my community, and also run career orientation sessions.

He then dedicated himself to transportation and 35 years later decided to start a small neighborhood grocery store in the northern Barranquilla, when he had enough money he was able to buy his own home and opened a small space and started his business. Today he sells basic household items, 30% of his sales are on credit and 70% are cash.

She lives with her husband and their children in a nuclear family in Banconi, one of the peripheral neighborhoods of the town of Sikasso. After having tried several businesses without much success, Sanata finally began a business selling wax cloths and cooking utensils, which she has now done for about five years.   \r\n\r\nIn order to better serve her growing customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago. After four group loans with a group of women from her neighborhood, she is now on her second individual loan. \r\n\r\nThis second loan will allow her to buy ten pieces of wax cloths and five packages of aluminum containers in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. They will be sold retail for cash and credit on foot in Sikasso, to a largely female clientele. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 175,000 FCFA, which will be used to increase her working capital, contribute to family expenses, and pay loan interest. \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                             "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1149974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy wax cloths and aluminum containers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":76138.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268677},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25379.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315499073},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25379.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103002},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25379.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243279},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25379.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624866},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25379.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179774}],"funded_date":"2012-09-02T12:22:59Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T15:55:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brianne S","image":1581911}},{"id":453332,"name":"Balimaya 3 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les dix  membres du groupe BALIMAYA 3 sont  des femmes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 32 ans et ont en moyenne 4 enfants.

This is how he came to set up a small workshop at his house where he does various jobs, such as manufacturing display cabinets, wardrobes, chairs, doors, etc.  Thanks to this job, he can support his family and give his children a good education.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be a great help so that Arturo can expand his workshop with the purchase of new tools.  He will also use this opportunity to buy materials like wood and melamine, so that he can complete his pending jobs.  He also wants to expand his business in order to improve his work and keep his customers happy.  Arturo is grateful for this help and for those who make this loan possible for his communal group.\r\n\r\n*Arturo is seated, wearing the white striped polo shirt and glasses in the photo.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":1161992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and melamine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T07:01:00Z","loan_amount":3825,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elidema Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Arturo Flavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hipolito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lolo Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":956.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":956.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":956.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":956.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1912.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131485},{"amount":956.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367385},{"amount":956.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976564}],"funded_date":"2012-09-03T12:02:15Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melia Meggs","image":1092315}},{"id":459170,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Solteira e m\u00e3e de 1 filho que frequenta a Escola, vive com a sua m\u00e3e e n\u00e3o sustenta mais ningu\u00e9m.\n\u00c9 negociante e dona do neg\u00f3cio de venda de produtos de primeira necessidade.

She is a member of the San Lu\u00eds communal bank, and became a part of this group a year and a half ago.  She lives in the community of Uzhupud, is 68 years old and is a widow.  Her marriage produced 5 children that are now older, married and living independently.  She lives in the company of a granddaughter whom she raised like a daughter from 2 months of age, and who now is almost 5 years old.  She had her own house which she lost, as it was very deteriorated from the passing of the years.  She now lives in a rented house.\r\n\r\nIn order to help her granddaughter get ahead, Mar\u00eda Isabel works raising and selling chickens and guinea pigs. This business allows her to spend time in the house taking care of her granddaughter. She will use her new loan to purchase pigs, animal feed, and manure to improve her pastures. Her greatest dream is to be healthy and to do all she can to help her granddaughter succeed.\r\n \r\nThe two small photos are of a female and a male member who could not be present when the photo of the group was taken."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":1160834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs, animal feed, and manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Paute","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T07:01:00Z","loan_amount":4150,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Edelmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelis Faviola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livia Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hernan Bolivar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":345.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1383.32,"local_amount":1383.32,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1383.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150520},{"amount":691.66,"local_amount":691.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":691.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383623},{"amount":1383.32,"local_amount":1383.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1383.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127004},{"amount":691.7,"local_amount":691.7,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":691.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517584}],"funded_date":"2012-09-09T21:31:47Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melia Meggs","image":1092315}},{"id":458791,"name":"Genngai Lom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kimboilhing (the lady who raised her hand in the photo) is 34 years of age and her husband is a daily wage labourer who does all kinds of odd jobs to meet the family\u2019s expenses.

Por lo que busco a personas que tenian conocimientos de la actividad y aprendi\u00f3 de ellos hasta que logro tener su fabrica de producci\u00f3n con dos hornos artesanales y 6 empleados a tiempo completo en \u00e9pocas o temporada. Con la dedicaci\u00f3n en  esta actividad a logrado  comprar dos camiones de 8 toneladas cada uno. \n\nLa mater\u00eda prima para la elaboraci\u00f3n de ladrillo y teja la obtiene en terrenos aleda\u00f1os (barro) y minas de arena que se encuentran a 25 kilometros de su vivienda y lugar de producci\u00f3n. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra insumos agr\u00edcolas y preparaci\u00f3n del suelo, para realizar el cultivo de 5 manzanas (35,000.00 metros cuadrados) de sorgo, con el objetivo de producir grano y el rastrojo del cultivo para utilizarlo en la alimentaci\u00f3n del ganado.\n\n Debido a las condiciones de clima y condiciones de suelo, donde maneja su explotaci\u00f3n de ganado, el pasto solo se produce en la \u00e9poca de invierno (junio a septiembre), por esta raz\u00f3n es necesario que produzca el pasto suficiente para abastecer de alimento su hato ganadero, de lo contrario se ver\u00eda en la dificultades y posiblemente tendr\u00eda que tomar la decisi\u00f3n de venderlo y dejar sin empleo a dos familias, que son las que le ayudan a desarrollar esta actividad y dependen directamente de este empleo.\n\nConf\u00eda  en  su experiencia y capacidad de administraci\u00f3n, desea hacer crecer su negocio, manifestando que prefiere el auto-empleo, d\u00e9bido a  que le permite dedicarle mayor tiempo a su familia y mejorar su relaci\u00f3n, a la vez sus ingresos son mejores que el salario m\u00ednimo al que podr\u00eda aspirar al desempe\u00f1arse como empleado. ","en":"Don Ra\u00fal is 52 years old and has lived with his life companion for the past 30 years. Currently he shares a home with five of his children, but two of them depend on them financially: a 15-year-old girl who is in the ninth grade at school and a 17-year-old boy who is in his first year of high school. The other children are employees of commercial businesses. \n\nHe says he is satisfied with the work of making mud bricks and roofing tiles which he has done for the past 20 years. He started the business after he stopped being a member of the revolutionary army Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed Para La Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional. After the peace accords were signed he did not wish to return to his parents who were livestock farmers, out of fear of possible reprisals. Since he had nothing by which to earn a living, a friend encouraged him to take up the work of handcrafting mud bricks and roofing tiles. Thus he sought out persons who knew the business and learned from them until he was able to start his own production factory with two handmade ovens and up to six full-time employees depending on the season. With dedication to this activity he has achieved the purchase of two 8-ton trucks. \n\nHis raw materials for making the bricks and tiles he gets from neighboring lands (mud) and sand mines which are 25 km from his home and place of production. \n\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of farming supplies and preparing the earth for planting 8.5 acres of sorghum with the goal of producing grain and stubble from the harvest for use in feeding the animals. \n\nOwing to climatic and soil conditions where he runs his livestock operation, grass is only produced during the winter season (June through September). Thus it is necessary to produce enough grass to supply food for his herd of livestock. Otherwise he would have problems and might possibly have to make the decision to sell them and leave two families without employment, who are the ones who help him carry out this business and who depend directly upon this employment. \n\nHe is confident of his experience and management abilities and wishes to grow his business, stating that he prefers self-employment since it allows him to spend more time with his family and improve relationships. Likewise his income is better than the minimal salary to which he could aspire were he to work as an employee.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1171217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase farming supplies and prepare the earth in order to plant 8.5 acres of sorghum.
