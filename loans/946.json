five children each all living in polygamous families in GOLOKOUNA, a village in SIKASSO (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the rainy season. They are on their second loan with the institution. The past loan was indeed paid back. \r\n\r\nThe crop grown is sorghum, as is the case with ABY, who is the one in the photo standing second from the right. With her loan, she intends to purchase farm inputs and seeds for maintaining 1.5 hectares.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, the produce is sold in the village, at the SIKASSO market, to a customer base composed of men and women. ABY plans on making an average profit of 190,000 francs CFA per planting. This profit will enable her to repay her loan and also to help her husband with day-to-day expenses. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1176568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase farm inputs and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Golokouna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T07:02:58Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T07:02:58Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aby ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoune ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tiocho ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiarra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":320000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":320000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":327014.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922591}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T04:55:54Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":465745,"name":"Sandra Milena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sandra muy consciente de la oportunidad, \u201cvende todo lo que el tendero no vende\u201d como ella misma lo dice, as\u00ed usted puede encontrar en su Stock, \u00fatiles de aseo en papeletas, unidades que la clientela compra mucho, productos de patillaje en el peso y en la medida que requieran los compradores, y en general art\u00edculos llamados productos en canal.

In order to be able to pay her university expenses, she first worked selling cell phone minutes.  After that she worked teaching writing classes.  Her mother is a school teacher, and her father has a small store.  They, along with her other five siblings, continue living in Tumaco.\r\n\r\nPaola\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in Cinematography and Audiovisual Technology in France.  In order to do so she needs to request support from Kiva.  It is the only way to be able to cover the expenses of the language exams and the university application fees. \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nWhen I left high school I aspired to study at the university.  At this time I lived in Tumaco, my native city, which is on the Pacific coast of Colombia.  At first I thought it was impossible because of my financial limitations.  Nevertheless, I was accepted, and I enrolled at the Universidad del Valle.  From there my story begins, full of challenges and opportunities that I was able to negotiate upon being, not only in another city, but also with financial obstacles.  It was thanks to my grades and support from the University, family, and friends that I completed my undergraduate studies in Social Communication.  What joy!\r\n\r\nNow I have the dream of studying abroad and learning about other cultures in order to contribute to my country\u2019s development.  I know that this is not an easy road.  Fortunately, a year ago I received the support of the \u201cPrograma de Semilleros de Talentos Regionales\u201d [The \u201cSeed Bed\u201d Program for Talented Students in the Region].  The support came through a language scholarship to study French.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle to continue with my professional and personal development I turn to Kiva for the support to continue harvesting triumphs, to return to my region all of my knowledge, to be a better person, and to know the world.  I am sure that in 2014 I will be in France getting my Master\u2019s Degree.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to Colombia after getting my Master\u2019s Degree, I have the dream of being able to make a documentary that shows all of the armed conflict that exists in my region.  I also want to make people aware of the cultural uprooting that takes place as the result of the forced displacement due to the war that is currently taking place in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1185448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the application expenses to study for a Master's Degree in Cinematography and Audio Visual Technology.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":914500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042081}],"funded_date":"2012-09-01T17:32:50Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":459579,"name":"Gumercindo Melvin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Gumercindo de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el Rama RAAS, es casado,  su esposa y sus 2 hijos, le ayudan en los trabajos agr\u00edcolas y Ganadero que realizan en el terreno que posee, el cual le saca provecho para el desarrollo y engorde de novillos para posteriormente comercializarlos y obtener sus recursos econ\u00f3micos para el sostenimiento familiar, Don Gumercindo ha luchado para sacar adelante a su Familia y mantener en buen estado su parcela que ha mejorado con esfuerzo propio, por lo que est\u00e1 interesado en experimentar el aumento de sus ingresos y el impacto que tendr\u00e1 en trabajar con cr\u00e9ditos que \u00e9l conf\u00eda le sean mayores sus ganancias, por lo que solicita este financiamiento para comprar 3 terneros para desarrollo y una vez que hayan ganado el peso esperado sacarlos al matadero para incrementar sus ingresos y por ende su calidad de vida.\n \nSus metas son aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo sus cr\u00e9ditos para llegar hacer un gran ganadero.\t\t\n","en":"Sr. Gumercindo, 36, lives in El Rama.

Tursunoy is one such person, who does everything possible to improve her standards of living and increase her family's budget. Tursunoy is married and is raising 4 children. Her husband works as a farmer and earns a meagre salary, which is insufficient to provide the family with all necessities of life. Tursunoy has decided to help her husband for the benefit of their family. To this end, she has completed the course \"Succeed\" offered by the Association of Businesswomen and received her graduation certificate. Now she is capable of launching her own business and achieving success on her own. \r\n\r\nTursunoy would like to focus her business on agriculture, as she has some experience in this area.

Empezaron vendiendo cervezas, poni malta, gaseosas e hicieron una peque\u00f1a pista donde bailar al aire libre; poco a poco este negocio se hizo mas popular, pero fueron present\u00e1ndose grandes desaf\u00edos como el deterioro de la salud de su t\u00edo y su madre ya no atendi\u00f3 mas el negocio.

","en":"Ingrid, 27, lives in the beautiful city of Cartagena de Indias, a colonial-style city located in the middle of the Caribbean coastline at the far northeast of Colombia. There she has a beverage shop where she sells mainly beer and Pony Malta. Her idea for the business came eight years ago, upon noticing that on a lot next to where she lived which was owned by her mother, her neighbors would meet with a lot of camaraderie, to chat about life and what was happening around them, to the sound of music provided by her uncle, through his equipment: a large-sized pick up truck.\r\n\r\nIngrid, with her business sense, suggested that her mother work with her uncle to make this lot a refreshing terrace. They began selling beers, Pony Malta, and soft drinks, and they made a small open-air dance floor. Little by little, this business became more popular, but there were great challenges, like the decline of her uncle's health, and that her mother no longer attended to the business.\r\n\r\nThis is how Ingrid took it up, moving to selling only beer and soft drinks by the case to small businesses nearby. Her cooler was filled through her mother's references with the supplier, which passed to Ingrid, and she has been able to maintain them. That is how she has had credit with these suppliers four years, but as her customer-base has grown, she needs more capital since her sales are good but limited to the credit that she has. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a greater volume of beers and soft drinks in general. Her goal is to convert her business into a commercial cooler recognized by all the businesses in the area where she is located, to obtain more income and a better wellbeing for her loved ones.

Kang\u2019s challenge in the business is that she sometimes cannot sell all her fish during the day, and those fish become rotten. Kang wants to overcome this challenge and increase her selling productivity by going through her commune selling her fish house to house. This will enable her to prevent a large loss. But Kang needs a vehicle to work out this plan. As a result, she is asking for a loan from HKL and Kiva to purchase a motorcycle, which will be used to transport her fish to sell door to door.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good and quality education to her children through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They own one tricycle, a motorcyle plus sidecar, that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a bounty (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 every day.\r\n\r\n To help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and accessories and also for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnnabelle dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

It's a parish that has many places to enjoy; its architecture is a mixture of modern and historical. The members are kind, warm people; some of them earn a living working in markets, but the work that they have in common is raising animals and agriculture. They are also proud to maintain the culture and traditions of their people.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mar\u00eda Dolores. This is the first loan that she has taken out in the communal bank, which she was invited to join by a friend. She is 48 years old, married, and has four children from her marriage. Two of them are married and live on their own, and her youngest son, who is 15 years old, is studying at a school in the city. Her other daughter set out on a trip seven years ago, but they haven't had any news from her since she left the house; they are still hoping that that day will arrive. Mar\u00eda Dolores's husband is a farmer, and they own the house they live in.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores spends her time doing household chores and working in the fields. She grows potatoes and vegetables that she sells in the city. She also raises guinea pigs, lambs, pigs, and hens, which she sells in her community.\r\n\r\nShe will invest her loan in the purchase of better breeds of hens, guinea pigs, and pigs.\r\n \r\nHer goal is to finish her house since it still lacks some of the doors and windows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1165170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy hens, guinea pigs, and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-01T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-01T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":675,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150525},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383628},{"amount":675,"local_amount":675,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990630},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127008},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517586}],"funded_date":"2012-09-03T15:03:23Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":461962,"name":"Lach","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lach is a 47-year-old married woman who has been raising piglets as her main source of income for ages, followed by a rice farming business. \r\n\r\nWhen the piglets mature, she usually sells them to butchers who come into her village.

I would like to introduce you to the Aguilas Group which is made up of ten members, the majority of whom know each other and have participated in the group for about six years. \r\n\r\nHilda is one of the members. She is 48 years old, separated from her husband, and has two children. She sells food, a business she began with help from her sister-in-law who encouraged her to work with her. They both used to deliver breakfasts to workers in various places. However, her sister-in-law became ill and left the business to Hilda. Currently Hilda runs it with help from her eldest daughter. They get up very early to take the food to their customers, most of whom work in a nearby shopping mall or offices. They serve juices, teas, quinua, and different types of sandwiches.\r\n\r\nAs the work is very hard, Hilda would like to have a permanent stall close to the place where they deliver the breakfasts. That way she wouldn\u2019t have travel expenses and wouldn\u2019t have to transport so much heavy food from her house.\r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s income provides money for household expenses and also her children\u2019s education. With the loan she will be able to buy a refrigerator which will be a great help as it will allow her to keep the food cold. \r\n\r\nHilda is very grateful for your help.

Her husband is Nathaniel, an engineer, and she is mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAdora operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell at a little profit. Her products are men's and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy RTW [Ready-To-Wear] products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAdora hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and draw her family more closely to God.

Eight years ago she was widowed and had to assume the responsibilities of her household alone. Thanks to her efforts she was able to educate her children and has one who is in the university. She is a hardworking woman who knew how to move her children ahead with the income she earned by selling groceries, which is her principal business. She also works in the orchard in her community in the afternoons. She will use the loan to purchase the merchandise she will sell in her small store, such as rice, sugar, milk, noodles, etc.\r\n\r\nClotilde is very happy because people who are not from her country are very interested in her story and in the dreams that each one of the members of her group has. For that she wants to thank each one of the members of Kiva and the team at Edaprospo for collaborating in her progress.\r\n\r\nClotilde is the first person from the left in the photo.

In the future, she wants to save some of her profit for the future expansion of her farming business.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1158488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for labor costs and to purchase five bags of fertilizer for her two-hectare plot of farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-09-02T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-02T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Houng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254249.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182648},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315413925},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323019231},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-23T10:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155504},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T09:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540512},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090671},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355834958},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-24T08:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364543785},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":127124.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372942459},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":254249.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381721899}],"funded_date":"2012-09-03T00:24:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-25T08:45:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":463402,"name":"Rasmiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasmiya, 46 years old and a married woman, helps her husband who works as a truck driver to pay some of the household bills from the income she gets out of her small home business selling embroidered clothes and blankets.

She is able to make an average of 10,000 KHR to support herself. Vann\u2019s son helps her earn income to elevate their living standard by operating a small electronics repair shop at home, where he provides his services to local people in his village. \r\n\r\nVann's son wants to purchase electronics spare parts for his store, so that he can keep his business secure as well as stabilize his income.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nClarita hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1175412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase grocery items and other products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-02T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-02T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":221.67,"local_amount":9333,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9390.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114547},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.96,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6707.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350594},{"amount":95,"local_amount":4000.04,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4024.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959702}],"funded_date":"2012-09-03T17:00:11Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:47:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":460819,"name":"Fatima Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a F\u00e1tima hoy en d\u00eda, labora en una empresa de zona franca, como operaria, obteniendo mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica, su trabajo siempre ha sido la costura, servicio que sigue dando, mas los fines de semana en su casa, teniendo esta otra entrada para solventar sus gastos, sali\u00f3 del taller que estaba con el objetivo de mejorar sus ingresos, ya que en zona franca le pagan las horas extras, y con eso se ayuda para seguir apoyando  a su hijo estudiante de la primaria.\nHa logrado mejorar   su casa, al optar al financiamiento, teniendo mejor oportunidad para salir adelante, con este nuevo pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comenzar hacer un muro, el cual tiene con zinc, y desea reguardar su propiedad y cuidar m\u00e1s  a si hijo, al no estar cerca de casa.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaileen Rose hopes to grow her business and dreams of a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She happily lives there with her spouse and three single children. Currently, only her last-born child is still attending to school. The other two children help her to manage their rice farm. Em owns just a small size land to grow rice, which does not result in yields annually and this encourages her to pursue another retail business to stabilize her income and support their household living needs. Em\u2019s husband provides well-digging services to local area, particularly for hand pump wells, and he has a good reputation because of his professional skills. As there is an order from his customer at the moment, Em\u2019s husband will lead his team to handle a good project.
