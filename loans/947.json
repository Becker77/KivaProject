Arturo is married having four children. He lives with his wife and their children in the village of Salinungan West San Mateo.\r\n\r\nArturo is raising three sows. He has been in this line of business for more than 20 years. As an additional source of income, Arturo also raises rice crops on his 7 hectares of rice field. He spends his profit on his two children, who are still students and on the maintenance of his rice field. For this reason, his capital for livestock is no longer enough. So, he would like to take out for a loan of 30,000 Philippine pesos. This amount will be used to purchase hog feed, vitamins and vaccines to make his hogs healthy and ensure they reach their optimum growth. He hopes that his requested loan will be granted so he will be able to let his two children finish their studies and be able to improve their way of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1176385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase hog feed, vitamins and vaccine for his hogs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Salinungan West San Mateo, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-09-02T23:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-02T23:40:15Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T09:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30615.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331916637}],"funded_date":"2012-09-05T16:36:37Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T09:58:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":461210,"name":"Amanecer Para Triunfar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento AMANECER PARA TRIUNFAR,  Est\u00e1  compuesto por nueve integrantes todas mujeres,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

She previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help with their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNancy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Norietta's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorietta hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family.

She lives with Carlos, who works abroad. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to grow her business through all her hard work on her business.

I am writing today but first I want to renew an indication of the display of affection and special consideration of all Peruvians.\r\n\r\nToday we speak of the group \u201cLa Cantuta,\u201d a group that is beginning its second cycle. It is a large group that consists of eleven members.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Patricia, one of the youngest. She is 20 years old, single, and lives with her mother and younger siblings and is pursuing university studies in management.\r\n\r\nShe decided to open a grocery store thanks to the advice of her mother about two years ago. Previously she worked preparing food (restaurant) as were some of her siblings, but the income was not sufficient to maintain all of them. So Patricia became independent and she pays for her studies with  the money she earns from her grocery store. She likes the business because she interacts with customers and has made many friends.

Besides her dairy business, Khatia works as a nurse to get additional income. She is a very hard-working person, with a great desire to get ahead.\r\nKhatia requested a loan for purchasing food for cattle.  She will purchase hay, which will be used for feeding the cows during the fall and winter seasons. Hay is cheap now and the price increases by 30-40% in the fall months. Khatia significantly saves on the costs of feeding the cows. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family.  This will increase the family income and Khatia will be able to improve their living

She is 56 years old and widowed with four children. \r\n\r\nSavorn has struggled to feed her children through working as a tailor in the local area for 36 years. The current business earns her about KHR 50,000 per day to meet the family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSavorn has been with VisionFund for four cycles while the other group member is in her first cycle with VisionFund.

Ruom is 40 years old and she is a married mother of six children, five daughters and one son, all of whom are dependent on her and still in school. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband have earned a living through pig-raising and rice-wine producing. They have been in these businesses for almost 20 years. Ruom has been with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund for one cycle and completely paid back the loan.

She is a mother to her four children. She, together with her children, manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagros operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMilagros hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1179800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married to Alberto, a vendor, and mother to her six children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnabelle operates a coconut and banana stand. She buys coconut fruit that are native to the Philippines, which are grown mostly in the southern region of Luzon. She also sells bananas. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. To help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more coconuts to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nAnabelle dreams to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1179968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes to grow her business and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Thanks to the good sales she\u2019s had these last few months, Margarita is looking for a loan that will make it possible for her to buy more clothes to meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to move the business forward so that she can provide her three children with a good education and more dignified life.  She also hopes that her business will make it possible for her to finish building her house and have a home in better condition.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1172077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is married to Michael, a baker's helper, and a mother to her child. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nLourdeliza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLourdeliza hopes to grow her business and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands.

Dealer's prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are depending on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRemelita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to have a good life for her family.

Using these funds, he was able to purchase tools for manufacturing furniture - an air compressor and a pneumatic stapler. This equipment has made work easier, and also improved the quality of the final product by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, Viktor was able to buy tools for manufacturing tents - now he and his staff can make tarpaulins for trucks. Since receiving his last loan from Kiva, Viktor and his family have finished home repairs and moved into their own house, while previously they lived in an apartment. Now everyone in their large family has more space. Finally, Viktor also expanded his business - he rented a large workshop with a big yard, which has given him enough space for making both furniture and tarpaulins.\r\n\r\nViktor is planning to invest his next Kiva loan of 10 000 hryvnia into purchasing additional materials for his business, namely foam, fabric, wood and other consumables. The loan will enable him to keep stocks of such materials on hand, instead of always waiting for them to arrive. Accordingly, with these Kiva funds Viktor will accelerate the turnaround of his orders. Fall is a busy time for orders, and he wants to be ready. Viktor considers that the main obstacle in his work is finding and training new employees, as the training takes a long time, while many people eventually leave the job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":817054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She\u2019s spent a great part of her life selling personal use products and this has contributed economically with her husband to provide their home with better quality of life for their children.\r\n\r\nShe used to have a distributorship where she was able to generate employment and she helped other people but due to circumstances beyond her control she had to close it and start from zero selling products.

Since that job did not generate enough money to meet household expenses, she decided to open her own business with a lot of effort in order to earn the necessary income. Though she started her fast food business with little capital, the effort she puts in each day has slowly positioned the business and made it prosper in the market.

Mery has worked as a seamstress for 20 years.  Initially she wanted to study languages, but her friends were working in sewing and they encouraged her to learn it too.  She started by helping them with small services and grew to have her own business.  Currently, Mery has a workshop in her home where she does clothing repairs and makes clothing to order.  She spends about five hours each afternoon doing this work.  \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Mery has a volunteer job at the Vaso de Leche in her town.  Vaso de Leche (Glass of Milk) is a government program that provides breakfast to children and seniors with few resources.  Mery helps to prepare the breakfasts along with other women.  The program receives only milk from the government, so to be able to offer the children a full breakfast, Mery and her friends have organized to purchase bread and other items.  \r\n\r\nMery will use a part of this loan to fix a sewing machine and the rest to purchase fabric.  \r\n\r\nMery is married and has four children.

The expression \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" symbolises someone with a kind heart, and worthy actions. The group has had 300 members since 2009. Its goal is to bring its members together and to allow them to conduct their various activities - namely agricultural and fish production, general import export business, transport, factory work, skilled labour, construction, animal rearing, mining, fishing, oil drilling, art and culture, printing and woodwork, public services, legal services, fish processing, agriculture, sale of spare parts, ice making, baking, and the provision of general services.\r\nThe group aims also to strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between its members in order to help them obtain the necessary practical and financial means to develop their revenue generating activities - such that all benefit from the advantages of group membership.\r\nIt is in this spirit that a heads of agreement has been signed between the group and UIMCEC, to the benefit of the group members on a national level. The first phase of the project has focused on a sample of 120 active group members, divided into 12 sub-groups of 10 people.\r\n\"MAKARIMAL Akhlakh group 5\" is a group of 10 members who offer their various services in the same market. They are represented by Dethi\u00e9 (dressed in purple in the photo). She has sold fabrics for the last 8 years, as well as crockery and ladies handbags. \r\nShe is a member of the UIMCEC and spends nine hours daily on her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase stock. Her plan is to diversify the range of goods she sells.\r\nThe profits generated from this will enable her to cover her childrens' schooling costs, and also to be able to put some money into savings. Her plan is to buy a plot of land for her parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5750,"image":{"id":1182494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

The store is located in a moderately-sized village 24 km from Nezhin.  When the time came, Alexander bought his store for $5,000.  Now he has been a businessman for three years.  His wife works as a saleswoman in the store.  The best-selling items are bread, sausages, dairy products, and household goods.  His inventory doesn't lie around unsold. \r\n\r\nAlexander has turned to Kiva for a loan of 15,000 hryven (UAH) to remodel his store on the outside by installing new siding and roofing; and on the inside by replacing the counters and installing a good-looking, high-quality floor.  For the near term, he is planning on investing all the additional income in continuing the remodeling so as to finish the entire job before

Her husband and business partner is Jaime, and she is mother to her five children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMeldesim operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also does direct selling for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMeldesim hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1181775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLolina hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She grows plantains, ginger, coffee and oranges. Just a year ago, she started harvesting coffee, and for that reason the production was not good this time, but next year her sales will be much better. In the meantime, she covers her main costs through the sale of oranges. Just this year she also started planting ginger, and she is sure that after harvesting it she will obtain good profits. \"Now a kilo sells for 3 soles, but I hope it will rise,\" she notes.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLea dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Bahra is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nBahra has six years' experience with the small home-based business activity and she is constantly on the lookout to make improvements to the services she can offer. In the past she successively received and repaid a Relief International - Microfinance Iraq loan which she used for buying an iron and ironing board and a table. She is now taking out a new loan to improve her work conditions through the renovation of her work area.   \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and this generates the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Rose Eden's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose Eden hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1183606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T02:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose Eden","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6352.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114621},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6352.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350667},{"amount":120,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5082.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959775},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094488}],"funded_date":"2012-09-06T00:55:59Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:31:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":467670,"name":"Zam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zam is 50 years old and lives in the town of Lyantonde in the Mbarara region of Uganda.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \n\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first stage  has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\n\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 8 has ten members who are part of the EIG, and who all live in the same neighborhood. They are represented by Raya, a married woman who has worked for ten years selling fabrics, crockery, shoes, and ladies\u2019 bags. She regularly travels to a country beside Senegal, where she buys her supplies. \n\nRaya is a member of a UIMCEC branch, and has requested a loan to have enough capital to finance her next trip. The profits that her business generates allow her to cover a large portion of her personal needs, to help her relatives, and to cover her children\u2019s education. Her main goal is to increase her savings, as well as to acquire a large store in the market where she can carry out her business.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1184005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To have enough capital to travel and buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbousse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieynaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kouly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Kine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ata  D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":467739,"name":"Surgeon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Surgeon is a 32-year-old married man with 4 children living in Kasese, Uganda.
