It's goal is to unite its members and allow them to carry out their agricultural production and fishery activities, their general importing and exporting activities, and their transportation, industrial, artisan, building, animal raising, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, artistic and cultural, printing, carpentry, services and actions for the public good, representation, processing of fishery products, agricultural, sale of spare parts, ice-making, and bakery activities, as well as provide various services.\r\n\r\nGIE also aims to consolidate the ties of friendship and solidarity between its members to allow them to acquire the necessary material and financial means to develop their revenue-generating activities and to benefit from all of the advantages that GIE offers. And it's against this background that an agreement was signed between GIE and UIMCEC for the benefit of the GIE members at the national level. The first phase applied to a sample of 120 active members divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nThe Makarimal  Akhlakh Groupe 7 group is is made up of ten GIE members who are all involved in the same business. They are represented by Abdoulaye, who has been selling fruit for several years now. His workday begins every morning and finishes at midnight. He is a member of a branch of the UIMCEC, and he is seeking a loan to buy fruits that he will resell.\r\n\r\nIncreasing his capital will allow him to stock up in greater quantity, consequently saving him time and reducing the costs associated with his daily commutes. The revenue that he earns from his business allows him to pay for the education of his children and support his family. His goal is to save enough money to start importing and exporting within the next two years.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1183981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits intended for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwige J.a.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Farimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seynabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moustapha ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nafi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holden Ferry","image":null}},{"id":467745,"name":"Felecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felecia is 28 years old and lives in Gardnersville.

He is married and has five children, age 7, 8, 14, 16 and 18 years; they are all school going children. \r\n\r\nIn 1991, Amadu established his dried fish business. He began his business because he came from a poor background. His parents were not educated and they did not know the value of education. Instead, they trained him in their life of business. He used to join his father in islands and villages to buy and trade dried fish. He was raised to be a fish monger.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and seven hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,837,000 every month from this business. Changes in price are his major problem.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. Amadu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase five baskets of dried fish @ SLL 800,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Amadu plans to see his children through university.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \r\n\r\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first phase has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 11 is a mixed sub-group with ten members, who all belong to the Makarimal Akhlah EIG and carry out their daily profit-making businesses in the same market. They are represented by Ndeye Coura, a married woman who has worked in retail for eight years selling food products. She is a member of UIMCEC, and has requested a loan to increase her working capital so that she can diversify the food products she sells. An increase in her profits will allow her to improve her family\u2019s food conditions, provide for her children\u2019s education, help her relatives and save money. In the future she would like to become a large retailer in the import-export field, and to run a large store in the market in the Senegalese capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5750,"image":{"id":1184218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \r\n\r\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first phase has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 12 is a mixed sub-group with ten members, who all belong to the Makarimal Akhlah EIG and carry out their daily profit-making businesses in the same market. They are represented by Babacar, a single man who has worked in retail for seven years selling clothing and shoes. He is a member of UIMCEC, and has requested a loan to increase his working capital so that he can diversify the products he sells, as well as to develop and expand his retail business. An increase in his profits will allow Babacar to financially support his parents and save money so that, in the future, he can realize his dream of becoming a large retailer in the import-export field.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1184318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy shoes and clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Babacar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mady","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Gueye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nene Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Bigue","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":467760,"name":"Mohamed M.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 32-year-old Mohamed M.

He is married and has 5 children, aged 3, 5, 8, 12 and 15 years, all are school-going children. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Daniel established his spare parts business selling clutches, fan belts, brake oil, engine oil, bearing, brake pads, brake liners, carbon brushes, etc. He began his business because he dropped out of school because of sponsorship.  His father sent him to a garage to acquire knowledge in vehicle maintenance.  After specializing in it and accumulating some amount of money, he opened a spare parts shop.  \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, Daniel earns about Le2,101,000  every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le6,000,000. Daniel has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy clutches (35 sets @ Le80,000), fan belts (80 pieces @ Le20,000), brake oil (30 units @ Le30,000), and carbon brushes (87 pieces @ Le8,000).  The balance Le4,000 will be used to pay labourers. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Daniel plans to build another house, educate his children, acquire a bigger shop and to become an international business man. This loan will help him to generate more income.  Daniel is a very hardworking and devoted man with good vision.  He thanks ARD for improving his business.

He studied electrical engineering at the Universidad del Norte.  He did this thanks to the many years of their lives that his parents saved for Emanuel\u2019s and his four siblings\u2019 education.\r\n\r\nEmanuel\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in Belgium or Holland.  The support from Kiva will help him to be able to pay the registration and preparation fees for the TOFEL and GRE exams.  Once he gets his Master\u2019s and returns to Colombia, Emanuel dreams of working on projects to develop a society with clean and sustainable energy.  He especially would like to work for a hydroelectric power plant.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that I have my family\u2019s support to fulfill this dream, my parents are not able to cover such high costs as this due to their limited financial situation.  Also, since I got my degree in 2011, it took me a year to get a job with a very low salary.  Kiva would be the support I need to take the first steps on this long road.  It would also be the catalyst to be able to get my Master\u2019s abroad.  I do not want to give up on meeting this objective.  I know that, thanks to my academic excellence and great effort, I can do it.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great source of immeasurable pride for me to know that I can contribute to the implementation of a model where the industrial sector really backs self-sustainability for the public.  The central idea is the use of renewable energy.  I realize that a Master\u2019s at one of the best universities in Europe would give me the tools and the knowledge needed to manage this undertaking.\r\n\r\nColombia, and South America in general, as an emergent economic block are the ideal settings for the implementation of this business model.  This is true not only because they have the needed natural resources, but also because it is early enough to avoid the errors committed by the more industrialized countries.\r\n\r\nThat is why I wish to work for a Colombian business that has this type of vision.  This way I will contribute all of my knowledge and effort to find a solution for this complex problem.  The only guarantee I have is to give the best of myself in order to fulfill my dream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1186545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the application fees to study for a Master's Degree in Energy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1312000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":109333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":1312000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1325300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381680568}],"funded_date":"2012-09-05T01:04:49Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:48:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":467782,"name":"Mbalu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbalu is a 47-year-old widow, and has five children, including three who attend school.

He lives in Khoni District, West Georgia with his wife Gulnara and 22-year-old daughter. Nugzar requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was always rejected, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNugzar\u2019s wife Gulnara lives abroad. She works abroad and sends part of her income to her family. Nugzar is leading his family's small-scale agricultural business. He runs a family-owned dairy farm with two milk cows. Nugzar produces cheese and sells it in the village. The family's average monthly income is 200 GEL. It is not enough to provide Nugzar and his daughter with normal living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNugzar requested a loan from Credo to re-start his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. With the credit, Nugzar will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard. He will raise them and sell them for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. Nugzar and his daughter also hope that the income will be enough for the family so that Gulnara will be able to return home and work in the family business.

She began her business because when she graduated from high school, there was not enough money for her parents to pay her college fees, being that her younger siblings\u2019 school fees were also stressing them.  \r\n\r\nShe decided to engage herself in selling fast food, so she dropped out of school for one year and saved enough to pay her first year's fees.  She continued with her little business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le832,000 every month from this business. Fatmata would like a loan in the amount of Le5,000,000. She requires a loan in order to purchase plastic chairs - 140 pieces @ Le35,000, with the balance of Le100,000 used for transport. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata hopes to be an importer.  The loan will help as it is additional capital for her business.  Fatmata\u2019s main challenge is the poor road network.

She is enthusiastic and a dreamer, with a strong desire to improve and provide a better quality of life to her family. Her husband is Crist\u00f3bal, with whom she has six children. They live together in the home that they built, which is a result of much effort and dedication. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling fruit. Everyday she goes out into the city streets, transporting her products in a cart and calling out in her strong voice to her customers, to buy her fruit. She has been selling in this way for a year and she works by herself. When the sun is very strong she sets up a small stand, with a small table under a plastic covering to provide shade, to sell there during the day.  Along with selling fruit, she also works in the evenings selling \"salchipapas\" (french fries and fried sausages) on the sidewalk outside her house. She is a woman who loves her work because it is her only form of income and it allows her to cover the necessary expenses which are demanded by her large family. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has taken out through MFP. She thanks everyone who has made her loan possible, so that she can make her plans reality.

His wife Shorena works abroad and transfers part of her income to her family to assist them financially. The main source of family income is a small dairy farm, led by Vazha. He has three milk cows from which he produces cheese to sell in the village to local dairy product retailers. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nVazha has requested a loan from Credo to restart the family business which was stopped recently due to financial problems. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, whose start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. Indeed, Vazha had requested loans from local financial institutions several times, but was rejected each time due to his low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Vazha will renovate family-owned greenhouses, which aren\u2019t functional now due to a state of disrepair.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person with a good heart and good practices.  Since 2009, this group has reached 300 members.  Its goal is to unite its members and to facilitate their activities: farming and fishing activities, general import-export trading, transportation, industrial production, crafts, construction, animal husbandry, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and culture, printing and woodwork, public utility or representation services, processing of fishing and farming crops, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, bakery business and various other services.\r\n\r\nThis EIG also intends to foster friendship and solidarity between its members and to help them acquire the material and financial means necessary to the development of their income-generating activities, while allowing them to benefit from all the advantages provided by the EIG.  It is with this spirit in mind that an agreement was signed between the EIG and the UIMCEC for the benefit of the interest group's members at the national level.  The first phase involved a sample of 120 active members divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nThe MAKARIMAL AKHLAKH (group 6) comprises ten members of the economic interest group.  These members all work at the same market, where they are involved in retail activities.  Their representative is Mr. Abdou, who has been involved in commerce and the small restaurant business since 2006.  He specifically provides breakfast services.

One of her children is starting seventh grade this year, which is a benchmark year, since most children drop out by the sixth grade, if they make it that far. In fact, Mar\u00eda did not have the opportunity to attend school at all. For several years, Mar\u00eda and her husband have devoted their energy and resources to agricultural activities. They grow vegetables such as carrots, radishes, cabbage, cauliflower, and potatoes on seven acres of land. They sell their products in nearby markets.  Maria also engages in the purchase and resale of vegetables while she is at the market, so that she leverages the use of her time.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is an enterprising, able woman who has designs to grow her economic prospects.  With this loan, she wants to add two new small enterprises: growing flowers and raising chickens.  She intends to use the loan to buy vegetable seeds to augment her current business, flower seeds, and four-dozen chickens. This is what Mar\u00eda says of her loan, \"I am delighted to receive this new loan, and I'm very eager for my two new projects, and my family supports me.\" \r\n\r\nThe 14 women of Mujeres Activas are very active and participatory. They love to participate during the monthly trainings delivered by a Friendship Bridge staff, where they discuss topics such as women's health, hygiene, children's rights, self-esteem, business administration, and money administration, among others. The Mujers Activas group is thankful for the support that the Kiva investors provide for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1184349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Todo esto hizo que fuera muy dif\u00edcil estudiar en una de las universidades m\u00e1s exigentes en el \u00e1rea de Ingenier\u00eda de Colombia, la Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS).\n\nEn un viaje con su equipo de f\u00fatbol se dio cuenta que lo que m\u00e1s quer\u00eda en su vida era dedicarse a la ingenier\u00eda y sacar buenas notas en su carrera. En sus \u00faltimos semestres de carrera fue de los mejores alumnos de su clase. Adem\u00e1s, obtuvo una tesis honor\u00edfica en sus estudios sobre Bioingenier\u00eda sobre se\u00f1ales el\u00e9ctricas cardiacas. \n\nAhora Juan Guillermo tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una maestr\u00eda en ingenier\u00eda electr\u00f3nica e innovaci\u00f3n en Francia y necesita el apoyo de Kiva para poder financiar los gastos de preparaci\u00f3n de ex\u00e1menes de idioma e inscripci\u00f3n a estos mismos ya que no tiene otra forma de pagarlos.\n\nAqu\u00ed esta su historia:\n\nEl prop\u00f3sito de la vida es el constante crecimiento, creo que como seres humanos estamos en continuo aprendizaje y cada vivencia trae consigo una ense\u00f1anza.\n\nEn mi caso quiero cada d\u00eda crecer m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s,  y el estudio es la base de ello.

He had the dream of being a professional soccer player one day, and he spent a lot of time and effort in the trainings and competitions.  All of this made it very difficult to study at one of the most demanding universities in the area of Engineering in Colombia, the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS).\r\n\r\nOn a trip with his soccer team he realized that what he wanted most in life was to devote himself to engineering and to get good grades in his courses.  In the last semesters of the courses for his degree he was among the best students in his class.  Also, he obtained honors for his thesis in his studies of Bioengineering about electrical cardiac signals.\r\n\r\nNow Juan Guillermo dreams of getting his Master\u2019s in Innovation Electrical Engineering in France.  He needs support from Kiva to be able to pay the expenses for enrollment and preparation for the language exams.  He does not have any other way of paying for them.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nLife\u2019s purpose is constant growth.  I believe that as human beings we are continually learning, and each experience brings with it a lesson.  In my case, I want to grow more and more each day.  Studying is the foundation for this.  Post graduate studies abroad will serve as a catalyst for my academic and personal growth.  It would prepare my mind to receive new ideas, and it would promote an intercultural exchange between people.  It would provide me with an important academic background.  These are meaningful reasons to wish to study in another country.\r\n\r\nNowadays the need arises to change things when they take an undesirable turn.  Any process has inevitable modifications; that is true.  However, I personally believe that what is most called for would be to turn them around at the time they happen.  Innovation, strategy, and entrepreneurship would be the tools that would allow me to act in the previously mentioned scenario.  Knowing each detail in depth, with numerous tools abroad, allows me to apply this in my country.  This is my aspiration in that regard.\r\n\r\nWith the above permitting, I see myself in the future returning to my country, generating new projects, and looking for solutions to diverse engineering problems.  The most import thing is developing ideas about sustainability in a territory that is rich in resources that are not renewable.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that I found a job in June, it would take me at least 15 months of savings, calculating that I can save 65 thousand pesos ($30 US) a month.  The Kiva program would help me in the process of studying outside of Colombia.  It would activate my project logistically and financially in order to be able to fulfill that which I have dreamed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1187202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Currently he lives with his wife and his 2 children in his house in the ger district: Mongolian traditional yurts and cheap houses on the boundary of Ulaanbaatar, which is the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nBatchuluun is a kind of preservationist man and he always cares about the environment. This time he is requesting a loan to repair the inside of his house and his low-pressure furnace in order to cut heat loss and emissions. He really worries that he uses too much coal and wood just to get his house warm inside. He has decided to cut his usage of fuel. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will make wall insulation and renovate the wall borders.

They are all friends and acquaintances, and they are responsible women who are struggling each day to provide for their families.  Most of the women work in agriculture, livestock production and retail trade.  Cumbe parish has a cold climate, and its architecture is a mix of colonial and modern styles.  There are a lot of places where one can enjoy nature.  Many of the residents work in the city or have migrated from different parts of the world in order to carry out activities that will allow them to improve the financial situation of their households.  In spite of all of this, they still maintain their culture and the traditions of their towns.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Bernardita.  She has been a member of the communal bank \"La Gran Amistad\" for a year.  Bernardita is a native of Nabon, but for work reasons and for her children's education she's been living in Paccha province for 8 years.  Every 28 days, she travels to Cumbe parish in Cuenca to meet with her communal bank and see her friends.  She is 51 years old and is married.  Together with her husband, she has 12 children: 7 of her children are married and live independently, and her 5 unmarried children are 17, 15, 14, 10 and 8 years of age.  Two of her children are in school, and one child is disabled and so stays in the home.  The two youngest study at a little school in the town. Her husband works as a bricklayer.  In her canton, she has her own house, but in Paccha province they live in a rented home.\r\n\r\nBernardita has a business raising guinea pigs and hens, because she doesn't have a lot of space to raise animals.  But in Nabon canton, she cultivates her land and she uses part of her harvest for her family's consumption, and sells the rest. She will invest this loan in the purchase of chickens so that she can have a greater variety of animals.  Her dream is to expand her economic activities, which include her work in farming and livestock production.  This way she will try to provide a better quality of life for her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1174206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-05T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-05T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Terecita De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Johanna Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Oliva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150569},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383671},{"amount":675,"local_amount":675,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990675},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127050},{"amount":450,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517601},{"amount":225,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069469}],"funded_date":"2012-09-13T02:26:50Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":468028,"name":"Bayarjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bayarjargal, 28, works as an electrician in the power plant in Dornod, an eastern province of Mongolia.

She is a very responsible person and dedicated to her business, in which she sells garments like sweaters, jackets, pants, etc.  She started working in this business 4 years ago, since she couldn't obtain employment even though she is a college graduate with a degree in Psychology. But, circumstances obligated her to take the path of sales to be able to contribute in her home and bring in daily meals.  \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to be able to buy more merchandise and then be able to increase her profits since she has had a good market of clients for plenty of time.

He is married, and has two children aged 20 and 25 years. He has two additional dependents living with him as sales assistants.  In 2002, Charles established his fish business. He began his business because he wants to help in bringing up his family. Working seven days-a-week and 15 hours per day, he earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 3, 000,000.

She is a brave and entrepreneurial woman, is 32 years of age, and is mother to four children. All of her children are at school, except for the youngest, and her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nKavira works selling food items, and began her business using funds received from her husband about five years ago. She then benefitted from her first loan from the Hekima microfinance institution around 2010, which gave her additional funds. She said that this helped her raise her children. The profits generated by her business allow her to save, as well as to school and feed her family.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kavira has now applied for a seventh loan. This new loan will be used to buy supplies of flour, oil, beans, etc., and the rest of the money will be used to buy school items for her children. She also plans to build a home. Kavira thanks Hekima and its partners for the steps they take to help poor women with low income become more autonomous.

At this time she is studying Electrical Engineering at the Universidad Industrial de Santander, one of the best engineering universities in Colombia.  This is all thanks to the important tuition discounts she managed to get because of her excellent academic performance and because she lives in one of the neighborhoods with the least resources in Bucaramanga.\r\n\r\nDairy lives with her mother, who is unemployed.  She is the oldest of three sisters.  She now wants to request this loan from Kiva because it is the only way she has to be able to pay for the preparation course and registration for the TOEL exams, which are the first steps to being able to fulfill her dream.\r\n\r\nThe following is her story:  \r\n\r\nMan does not stop dreaming until he limits himself.  In my youth I visualized the biggest opportunity to be dreaming and to dare, without qualms, to complete everything I had proposed to do.  It is here, in the middle of my objectives and hopes, where I realize that knowledge is the greatest wealth.  It is invaluable, constant, memorable, and worthy of being considered to be the fortune that cannot be taken away from people. \r\n\r\nIt is among my aspirations as a student to acquire and internalize everything that is learned.  Later, after having done this in an atmosphere of more advanced studies, I want to able to undertake a path of returning to my county and applying, in a sound and executable way, said knowledge.  In this way I will be able to contribute to the country\u2019s technological, financial, and social development.  These are three factors that are now essentially fundamental to the complete development of a country.\r\n\r\nI am a student with good academic credentials.  I am prepared to work closely with the technological development of the country.  I will do so with a great desire to integrate what I have learned with new knowledge that can contribute to my academic and spiritual formation.\r\n\r\nI believe that you never stop learning.  Every day we have the obligation to take advantage of each moment life gives us and the time to cultivate knowledge.  The world of knowledge is open to anyone who wants to enter it, and I am prepared to do so.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1187207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Cambodia, Phy is 48 years old and married with four children, three of whom are dependent on her and some are in school. To support the family, she has been farming rice on five hectares of farmland for several years and supplements her income by raising pigs. The current business earns her about 23,000KHR per day and she manages to save about 10,000KHR each day for the future.

Thanks to this business she can pay her children's school expenses, because she is father and mother to them.  Now she wants to expand her store to sell more products, but in greater proportions so she will sell both wholesale and retail.  What she likes most about her job is that the people inspire her to get ahead and expand her store.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity she is being given.  She promises to make her payments punctually.  She also thanks her communal bank for the responsibility that each member has and for accepting her as a member.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 2,500 soles [PEN] she will invest in buying groceries to stock her store and sell more than just beverages.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1175099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-05T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-05T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":207.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":226.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":233.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":226.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":248.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":257.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":256.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":274.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":283.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":286.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":169.22,"local_amount":433.9,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":442.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452321},{"amount":91.18,"local_amount":233.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":238.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447496},{"amount":88.19,"local_amount":226.11,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":230.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053396},{"amount":97.08,"local_amount":248.93,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":253.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188321},{"amount":100.28,"local_amount":257.13,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":262.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572242},{"amount":99.98,"local_amount":256.35,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":261.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121908},{"amount":106.86,"local_amount":274.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":279.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867823},{"amount":110.39,"local_amount":283.04,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":288.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576778},{"amount":111.82,"local_amount":286.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":292.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529032}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T16:58:59Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":468119,"name":"Chhom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhom, aged 25, is a diligent farmer living in the Prey Chor District, Kampong Cham Province.

He requested a loan from Credo for purchasing a musical instrument, in particular an electric piano. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He is 43 years old, married, and is raising 3 children. \r\n\r\nFor over 4 years, Ahmadjon has been raising crops, including wheat, potatoes, carrots, and so on. He sells his harvest at the market. Because his produce is of very high quality, there is great demand for it. His wife, children and brother help him in his business. \r\n\r\nAhmadjon wants to provide his family with all the necessities of life.

In the photo she's standing in the back in front of the balloons, in the fourth place from the left.  She's wearing black and has long, dark hair that she wears loose.\r\n\r\nShe has worked for four months in the area of gifts, selling wool, clasps, and fabric.  She says she works in her home Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m.  Her mother also works with her.  She buys the merchandise and supplies she needs in wool fabrics in gift shops, places where she finds lace (an ornamental and transparent fabric that is handmade and decorated with embroidery).\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy fabric, lace, and wool.\r\n\r\nOne of Rosa's goals is to expand her place with a greater variety of wool, to do more embossing, and for her embossing and embroidery machines to have a lot of space, so she can generate more income.\r\n\r\nRosa lives with her husband and two children, 15 and 2.  Her dreams for her job and her family are to have a big workshop for her mother and to sell all brands and colors of wool.\r\n\r\nShe's very happy about and grateful for the opportunity offered by Fondo Esperanza, because the loan will allow her to invest in her business.  In addition, she's comfortable with her communal bank group, which motivates her to continue contributing to the institution.  She also comments that the trainings given in the meetings have helped her invest better in her business.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is located at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River, one of the largest rivers in the country, in the south of Chile in the Biob\u00edo region. It has had an important role in our history, being the site of important battles and a notable settlement, especially during the Arauco War, because it's on the border of Mapuche territory. Currently the city has important economic and demographic development and is coming to be considered one of the most notable urban, demographic, administrative, financial, and commercial centers of Chile, after Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1175667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, lace, and wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-09-05T21:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-05T21:50:01Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nolberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzgarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1643280,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108048},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":113406},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112404},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113470},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114554},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114180},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":118062},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117870},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118990},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":120130},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":121278},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":122426},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":123592},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":124870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1655.15,"local_amount":794124,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":799851.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147852},{"amount":1251.99,"local_amount":600694,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":605026.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381009},{"amount":517.86,"local_amount":248462,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":250253.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988159}],"funded_date":"2012-09-06T14:00:19Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:33:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":468146,"name":"Shahzadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahzadi, a 48-year-old married woman, has been making shoes for the last 10 years, a business she started to help support her family, which consists of six children.
