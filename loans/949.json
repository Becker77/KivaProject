Since he loved taking care of people, he worked part-time as a paramedic until he purchased a Snap Fitness franchise in the Houston suburb of Spring. Rex said he was looking for freedom and the ability to have family time. Rex moved to Texas in 1980 from the Midwest and started a new life in the Lone Star State, marrying and starting a family. His wife and children participate in the management of this unique family-run gym in the Houston area. Rex and his family pride themselves in knowing each gym member.\r\n\r\nRex's gym offers a Fitness-on-Demand room, which is a virtual classroom members can use for activities such as Pilates, yoga, kickboxing, spin classes and step aerobics. Rex obtained a loan from Accion Texas Inc. to purchase a new piece of equipment to better assist his members: a TRX.  The fitness device was created by a former Navy SEAL and uses the operator's weight as resistance for a full-body workout. Rex said he doesn't want his members to feel lost in using any of his equipment and is currently offering classes on how to use the machine.\r\n\r\nRex's venture has created three jobs and he plans to contract with two other trainers. Since approval of the loan in late July and the purchase of the TRX, three people have signed for new memberships. Snap Fitness is open but not staffed 24 hours a day, which Rex says helps him keep membership prices lower than other gyms.

From this business, she is able to generate an income of approximately 2 USD per day. Bin is very professional in her career because she has been doing this for ages. Some of her children also help with the maintenance of the rice field and one is running a retail clothes store in a market in Phnom Penh. Recently, Bin\u2019s daughter\u2019s stock of clothes is decreasing and thus the number of frequent customers is also decreasing. In order to sustain this business, she has to restore her stock again. But due to the lack of funds, Bin would like to take out a loan of 1,000 USD to purchase used clothes for her daughter's retail shop. This loan will allow Bin\u2019s daughter to maintain her customers and to keep developing her business. In the future, Bin hopes to expand both her farming business and the retail business of her

basic infrastructure, of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia. He has worked at a local combine, then he ran a micro-bus for a local area of the city, after that he worked at the biggest outdoor market of Mongolia.  \r\n\r\nCurrently his family lives in a yurt, a traditional Mongolian felt tent. During the winter season it\u2019s really difficult to live in a yurt, as the temperature goes below minus 25-30 degrees.

It takes 20 minutes to reach the place where he buys his supplies. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to pay the lease on the pastures for his animals, for weeding on his land, for veterinarian care and to purchase fodder. With the loan he will provide medicine and feed for his cows as well as a place to take them to pasture so that he can increase their production of milk and fatten them in order to sell them at a good price.

She is 42 years old. Sopio is married and lives with her son, a daughter-in-law and a daughter. \r\n\r\nThe family earns a living through a dairy business. In particular, they have three milk cows. Sopio milks the cows and produces cheese. She sells milk and cheese locally. Sopio is a very hard-working woman, but she still doesn\u2019t have enough income to make some savings and improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n \r\nShe requested a loan to purchase food for the cattle and to renovate her house. With this credit, she will purchase hay, which will be used for feeding the cows during the fall and winter seasons. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family. Sopio also plans to purchase building materials and repair the house, which is old and damaged. Due to the above mentioned, the living conditions of the family will be improved and they will be able to spend their evenings after a hard working day in a more comfortable environment. Sopio hopes for your help and kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1186378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The UNIDO SOMOS [We Are United] communal bank is in El Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Puerto Pechiche parish, Pueblo Viejo canton. The communal bank members are seasonal farmers who grow corn, rice and beans. Rosaura grows corn, rice, and beans. She buys her products at the Karlita agricultural supply center and sells at the Castillo center. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to plant corn, rice, and beans and to buy seeds, urea, farm supplies, and fertilizers for the crops.

Creo como bien dice Fernando Gonzalez que: \u201c Los que triunfan, lo deben a una creencia arraigada, generalmente a la creencia en si mismos\u201d \n\nAhora quiero alcanzar este sue\u00f1o y en mi camino me encontr\u00e9 con el Semillero de Talentos regionales y KIVA, los cuales han sido y ser\u00e1n un gran soporte personal y profesional en una etapa en la cual necesito financiar las aplicaciones a las universidades, pagar los cursos de preparaci\u00f3n y ex\u00e1menes del TOEFL IBT.\n\nCon su ayuda, pretendo poder llevar este sue\u00f1o a una realidad. Realidad que me envuelve no solo a m\u00ed, sino  a mi comunidad. Con la cual a mi regreso del estudio, quisiera realizar un impacto a nivel de emprendimiento a trav\u00e9s de la ense\u00f1anza a ni\u00f1os; compartiendo experiencias que  fortalezcan los programas de Arte en mi ciudad, para lograr un impacto en cuanto a la calidad de los mismos y al fortalecimiento de sus contenido, motivando a otros estudiantes para que como yo, nunca duden en luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.\n","en":"Valentina, age 27, was born in Manizales, Colombia.  She studied Visual Arts at the Universidad P\u00fablica de Caldas.  This is thanks to the socio-economic incentives she received from the Colombian government.  At this time Valentina does not have a steady job, and she devotes a large part of her time with her mother, who is very ill.\r\n\r\nValentina\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in the United States or the United Kingdom.  The support from Kiva would help her be able to pay for the preparation courses for TOEL, registration for the exam, and the applications to various universities, which are very expensive.  With Kiva support she would also be able to pay for the cost of sending out her portfolio and documents.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nUpon finishing my undergraduate studies in Art, I have just started a new stage of my life.  Since then every decision I have made has been thinking about reaching my dream of studying for a Master\u2019s in Fine Arts.  During these years I have made a great effort to stay true to my creative activity, affording myself the dedication and discipline that it involves.  Even though this signifies little financial benefits, I am setting a big goal personally and professionally as an artist.\r\n\r\nI have struggled for these goals day after day.  I have balanced my instruction time and my artistic practice time.  I am sharing my passion for painting, color, and form with others.  I have taught children, youth, and adults.  Along with attending workshops and participating in expositions, I have been building a better quality of life as an artist.  I am trying to do much with little.  I believe, as Fernando Gonzalez well said, \u201cThose who triumph owe it to a strong belief, generally a belief in themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nI now want to reach this dream, and along the way I found the regional Semillero de Talentos [\u201cSeedbed\u201d of Talent] and Kiva.  They have been, and will be, a great personal and professional support in a time when I need to pay for the university applications, the preparation courses, and the TOEFL IBT exams.\r\n\r\nWith your help I hope to be able to makes this dream a reality that embraces not just me, but my community as well.  With this, upon my return from studying, I would like to make an impact on an entrepreneurial level by teaching children and sharing experiences that strengthen the Art programs in my city.  I would like to make an impact on the quality of the programs and the strength of their content.  I would like to motivate other sudents so that they, like me, never hesitate to fight for their dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1187227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Because the income her husband generated was insufficient to meet all household expenses she decided to open her own business so that she could contribute economically to the family while still being able to watch her children.  This is how she set up a general store at home where she stocks basic staples for her customers and thanks to this her family\u2019s quality of life has been improving.  She hopes to be able to overcome her home\u2019s economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe greatest opportunity this business has afforded her is to be able to provide her children with access to a better quality education and this is why she works hard every day so that it will continue providing her family with better possibilities.  Aiming at increasing the variety of products she has in stock, Luz Adriana is looking for financing to buy basic staple items and thus offer more variety to her customers.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to move the business forward so that she can provide a better quality of life for her family and to have better financial wherewithal for their support.  In addition, she hopes in future that it will be a source of income that will lead to her reaching her greatest dream: to get a house of her own for her

He lives in Ica, a city known for its warm and cozy climate, the friendliness of the people and above all, for its agriculture, especially the cotton, grape, asparagus etc. production.  Julio is very hard-working.  He is the father of two beautiful children, ages 2 and 3 years old.  He loves them very much and for their sake he works hard, to get them ahead.  When he has some free time, Julio likes to go walking with his children or sometimes he plays soccer with his friends and neighbors.  He also really likes traditional Peruvian food.  One of his favorite dishes is \u201cAj\u00ed de Gallina,\u201d (spicy creamed chicken).  Because of his family's limited resources, Julio was only able to go to secondary school.  But he would have liked very much to have studied at the university level. \r\n\r\nDay after day, Julio works in his small business as an iron worker.  He makes doors, windows and other items out of wood and metal.  He works about 8 hours a day, and he believes that his business is doing well because he is very responsible and has a great desire to get ahead. \r\n\r\nJulio is very grateful for the Kiva lenders.

adelante con sus estudios se dedica a la venta de ropa todo tipo, su forma de venta es puerta a puerta ya que sale a recorrer de tres a cuatro d\u00edas a la semana unas  tres horas al d\u00eda, la mayor parte de sus ventas son bajo pedidos que le hacen sus clientes con anticipaci\u00f3n, deja sus productos a cr\u00e9dito y cobra cada ocho d\u00edas. La ropa la compra en Guayaquil ya que all\u00e1 consigue m\u00e1s barato y hay m\u00e1s variedad.

She is studying at the university and lives at home with her parents.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working young woman, who works selling all types of clothing in order to have her own resources, which allow her to continue studying.  She makes her sales door to door, working three or four days a week for about three hours each day.  The majority of her sales come from orders that her customers place in advance.  She offers her products on credit and collects her payments every eight days.  She purchases the clothing in Guayaquil since she can get it less expensive and there is more variety.  She has worked for three years doing this and it is going well.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting another loan with the organization.  The other loan that she received was a great help to her since with the earnings that she obtained she could pay her tuition and begin her studies at the university.  She would like a new loan to be able to invest in her business and thus, acquire more income to be able to achieve her goal of becoming a great professional.  This loan is to purchase all types of clothing.  She has had three loan cycles in the communal bank and she enjoys it because the loans are very important in moving ahead.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to finish her studies and be a great professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1007592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150592},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383694},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990698},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127073},{"amount":375,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517603},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069471}],"funded_date":"2012-09-08T20:39:55Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":468568,"name":"Amen 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arsene, age 50, is married with four children, ages 3 to 22 years old.

She is 36 years old and is a single mother with a 19-year-old son who is studying in the university. She has been in the communal bank for four loan cycles, and she likes it because the loans are quick and don't have too many requirements.\r\n\r\nShe works in commerce in order to earn a living and thus help her son with his studies. She has a shop in her house where she sells American clothing, shoes, and purses, among other products, that they send her from the United States. She works in her business every day, and she also prepares food and appetizers for a social events center in the city, a business that she works in up to two times a week and from which she earns a good amount by selling these dishes. She has had this business for more than 9 years, and this is how she has managed to raise her son alone so that he could become a good person.\r\n\r\nShe is repeating the loan that was of so much help to her, since she was able to pay for the merchandise that arrived for her during this time. In her business, as always, she has had very good days and others that were not so good, but it has allowed her to advance and to give her son a very good education. This loan is to buy clothing, shoes, and purses (for her store) and groceries to prepare her delicious dishes.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a big restaurant in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1007600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and has five children. She owns a retail shop, which she has been operating for one year. She also sells coconuts.\r\n\r\nShe learned about Milango through a friend and aims to access credit to improve the operation of her business.

She describes herself as friendly and a listener. Susan has operated a retail business where she sells poultry for the past two years. Her business is located near a busy town and her primary customers are hotels and local residents. She describes her biggest business challenge as insufficient funds for purchasing chickens to sell. \r\n\r\nSusan will use the Kes 20,000 loan to buy layer chickens to mix with the broiler chickens which she already has. Her business goal is to be a supplier of poultry within five years. She hopes that in the future, she will venture into a new business of having rental houses.

Maria previously had a stand at the market, but she was not able to earn much.  One of her friends convinced her to try another method of working, so she was immediately excited about trying it.  Now she buys vegetables directly from the fields in bulk and then sells them at different markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy vegetables and tubers in large quantities so that she can get a better price.  As a result, she will be able to serve more customers at the various markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is 45 years old and has three children.  Her greatest wish is to have a store in her house.  She hopes to accomplish this very soon since she already has adequate space.  Maria is grateful for this loan and is pleased that many people are interested in helping her make progress.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo, Maria is the woman seated on the right wearing a black track suit.

\n\n","en":"Lora is 61 years old. She is a very hard-working woman. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, Lora was left alone with 2 daughters. She searched for work in order to feed her family, but no one would hire her since she had only a high school education and no work experience. Lora began working in a cafe as a dishwasher. However, she couldn't afford to support her family on the low salary she received, and she had to ask for the customers' leftovers so that she could feed her kids. \r\n\r\nLora thought long and hard about how to solve this problem and eventually decided that the way to improve her family's welfare was to open her own business. For the past two years, Lora has been making a decent living because she now owns her own cafe. \r\n\r\nAs Tajikistan's Independence Day is approaching, Lora has come to IMON International for a loan to help her meet the holiday demand. She plans to expand her cafe offerings by increasing the range of dishes she sells. This will require the purchase of more food items.\r\n\r\nLora is grateful to the kind lenders of Kiva for supporting her in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1190329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy food items   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T06:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":285.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":289.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":301.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":301.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":321.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":332.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":335.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":345.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":356.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":366.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":376.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":387.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":285.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":289.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316392167},{"amount":61.68,"local_amount":290.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":293.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323026607},{"amount":64.38,"local_amount":302.98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":306.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162666},{"amount":64.33,"local_amount":302.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":306.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740548},{"amount":68.59,"local_amount":322.8,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":326.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347055869},{"amount":530.32,"local_amount":2495.58,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801584}],"funded_date":"2012-09-07T15:25:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":468667,"name":"Saumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saumu is taking out another loan so as to invest it in her existing business.

She buys her merchandise based on her customers' orders and requirements.  Fortunately, her business is popular and she doesn't experience any problems in collecting payment for her goods because her customers are all people who work in private institutions and she finds it easy to spot those who are responsible.  All the items of clothing that she sells are well-known brands and this allows her to make good profits on each sale.  She has been in this line of work for almost five years.  She works alone and really enjoys what she does.\r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's fourth loan from MFP.  She is grateful to those who make it possible for her to continue achieving her aims.

She is 57 years old and has 3 children living with her and her husband. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Aisha is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has 12 years experience with the small home-based sewing and tailoring business and has earned a good reputation with her basic but great quality services.

Jason is currently running a business, and these are his first farm animals (which is why the photo does not reflect any chickens).\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"He is able to plan his work, and no one harasses or follows him around -- it gives him satisfaction!\" His biggest challenge is \"lack of enough capital for expansion and bad debtors.\"\r\n\r\nJason was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"He learnt from his friends who are members of Juhudi Kilimo.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"how to make use of the loan wisely and avoid default.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is business related. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Jason replied that he will generate more income and take his children to good schools.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

His business runs well thanks to the welcoming atmosphere and his experience, and he has obtained a faithful customer base that is growing with time. His only problem is a lack of stock in terms of drinks, thanks to the small amount of capital he has, which then forces him to buy at retail from the drink stores in the area. Thanks to this loan, he will be able to obtain supplies in bulk from a set of arranged suppliers, which will allow him to diversify his stock of drinks, satisfy his customers, and increase his profit margin. He will save a portion of the profits generated by this investment in order to pay for his children's education, and the rest will be reinvested in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1189348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To buy cases of drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T16:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T16:10:11Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymond Elysee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20672},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21460},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22246},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23034},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23820},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24607},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25394},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26181},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26967},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27755},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28541},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29323}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.34,"local_amount":20672,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":21501.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306562},{"amount":42.92,"local_amount":21460,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22320.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914909},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":22246,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":23138.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047144},{"amount":46.06,"local_amount":23034,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":23957.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436939},{"amount":47.64,"local_amount":23820,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":24775.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989358},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":50001,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437120},{"amount":52.36,"local_amount":26181,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27231.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842179},{"amount":53.93,"local_amount":26967,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28048.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610197},{"amount":55.51,"local_amount":27755,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":28868.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390467758},{"amount":115.73,"local_amount":57864,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":60184.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399723769}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T13:26:52Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T08:45:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":469730,"name":"Afiwa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Afi est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47ans.

She makes credit and cash sales among neighbors, friends, family members, and referrals, who make up her list of customers. Her business has allowed her to achieve the goal she set when she started out, which was none other than to generate enough income to cover her home expenses. By working approximately eight hours a day, she has managed to keep her business going, and her goal for prosperity is to expand more and more until she makes it into a large shop where she can offer all the products the customers in her neighborhood need. \r\n\r\nDiana makes cash purchases every week according to the orders she receives from her customers.

 de 37 a\u00f1os de edad es la propietaria de una peluquer\u00eda en ubicada en el barrio La Playa, donde habita con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 2 hijos en las edades de 5 y 16 a\u00f1os. Su negocio naci\u00f3 a la edad de 34 a\u00f1os, despu\u00e9s de haber sido empleada en una peluquer\u00eda al norte de la ciudad de Barranquilla y a la que dedicaba mucho de su tiempo, sin poder cumplir efectivamente con las obligaciones de su hogar,  las que la obligaron a Dolis a renunciar a su trabajo; all\u00ed  como empleada, adquiri\u00f3 mucha experiencia y  con ella emprendi\u00f3 su aventura de negocios en su propia casa; Su primer apoyo lo recibi\u00f3 de su suegra, quien compr\u00f3 su primera silla y espejo, para que  se desempe\u00f1ara en su oficio. Poco a poco gan\u00f3 una extendida clientela, que hoy la acompa\u00f1a y a quienes ofrece los servicios de corte de cabello, blower, tintes, aliser y masajes capilares. Desde hace 1 a\u00f1o se acerc\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para acceder a un cr\u00e9dito y con \u00e9l compr\u00f3 un nuevo lava cabezas, y una vitrina para almacenar sus productos, adem\u00e1s de materiales para prestar el servicio con eficiencia. Su oferta va dirigida directamente al consumidor final y tiene servicio a domicilio para su clientela, pero este no es los sus clientes solicitan con frecuencia. Su horario se ajusta a las necesidades de la clientela y usualmente abre las puertas de su negocio a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana y cierra a las 9 de la noche de lunes a domingos. Con su anterior cr\u00e9dito ha mejorado la presentaci\u00f3n de su negocio y cuando sus clientes ingresan al negocio, captan la imagen de calidad en su infraestructura y en su trato amable y la superioridad en lo que Dolis sabe hacer. Actualmente est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 1 aire acondicionado, un mueble para organizar su sala de espera, todo esto contribuir\u00e1 a que su clientela est\u00e9 atenta al servicio, por que encuentran un ambiente refrescante, contrario al incesante calor, al exterior de su negocio, causado por el rigor con que brilla el sol del Caribe.  ","en":"Dolis is 37 years old. She is the owner of a hair salon in the La Playa neighborhood, where she lives with her spouse and two children, aged 5 and 16. Her business was born when she was 34, after having worked at a hair salon on the north side of the city of Barranquilla where she spent most of her time. As an employee there, she gained a lot of experience and started her business venture in her own house. She received her first support from her mother in law who bought her first chair and mirror so she could ply her trade. Little by little she gained more clientele to whom she offers the services of haircuts, blowouts, coloring, straightening  and scalp massages. A year ago, she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to access a loan and with it bought a new hairwasher, a display case to keep her products in and materials to operate efficiently. She deals directly with the consumer and does do housecalls, but that is not something her clients ask for frequently. She adjusts her schedule to the client's needs and ususally opens her doors at 8 in the morning and closes at 9 at night. Monday through Sunday. With the previous loan, she has improved the look of the business and when her clients come in they see the image of quality in her infrastructure and the friendly treatment and in the superior quality of what Dolis knows how to do. Right now, she is applying for a new Kiva loan with which she will purchase an air conditioner, and some furniture to organize her waiting area. All of this will contruibute to her clientele being more aware of the service because they will be in a refreshing ambience away from the incessant heat outside the business caused by the strength of the Carribean sun.

What she likes about her work is that it is profitable; it provides her with good income so she can cover her household expenses.  What she does not like is that sometimes she does not have enough money to invest when a good buying opportunity comes up.  Despite that, she is very motivated to keep working and she wants to expand her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, as this makes her feel secure in moving ahead with her business.

The unpaved streets slow his work and deteriorate some parts of his vehicle. But he still wants to continue working and set up a store for motorcar parts.\r\n\r\nThis is his 7th loan with MFP.

She believes that her work requires a lot of patience and a real aptitude.  When the right amount of time has passed and the birds have reached their ideal weight, she takes them in special cages to the city's market to sell.  She has been doing this work for four years, which was time she needed and that has allowed her to fall into the rhythm of her work and to learn the selling techniques that allow her to earn more.  She has the complete help of her older children and her partner.  What she likes about her work are the profits she receives from her sales, which allow her to cover her daily household expenses.  What she does not like is that the price of chicken feed is not stable and from one minute to the next it can go up, which means she has to spend more.
