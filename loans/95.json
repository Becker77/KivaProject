She lives with Omar, her husband of seven years.  The couple have one daughter, Andrea, who they love very much and care for in her mother's house which is located in Chupaca neighborhood.  Janny's calm and gentle face reflects the serenity for which she is noted.\r\n\r\nAt just 20 years of age, Janny faced many responsibilities.  One of these responsibilities came with the arrival of her young daughter who she loves very much.  She continued studying in spite of this and now works as an administrative assistant with the local government in her community.  Thanks to her work, she receives a monthly salary from the State.  However, as she would like to improve her quality of life, she recently opened a grocery store in her mom's home.  Her mom helps her to serve her customers in the mornings and afternoons and, when she finishes work, Janny takes over.  In addition, she also raises cows and calves which she fattens and then sells at a higher price.  With all these sources of income, she hopes to be able to put together the money she needs to provide her daughter with a good education.\r\n\r\nThis is Janny's second loan from MFP and she is grateful for the trust that has been placed in her.

Later she helped her grandmother at the market sell the variety of food that she prepared. After a time, Ang\u00e9lica worked with her grandmother to sell the food in little bags to the shoppers in the local market of Sumpango. After several years, her grandmother gave her the opportunity to share the sales giving her three days each week to sell the food, which helped her gain experience in food sales.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 46 years old, lives with her common-law husband, and has 3 adult children who live independently.  She has worked with EDAPROSPO for 3 years and sells handicrafts such as small rugs, decorations, etc.  She also sells cheese.  To do this she takes advantage of the fact that her husband is a truck driver who transports heavy cargo every weekend to La Oroya.  She can sell to the people who live at the mine and others, and on the return trip she purchases cheese to distribute and fill orders.  This activity enables her to cover her expenses at home and to save capital to purchase wool and cheese.  The most recent loan of 700.00 new soles will be used to purchase more wool in various colors.  In the future she would like to save more capital to be able to cover all of her customers' orders and to finish building her home.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":337212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase more wool in various colors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":163.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":171.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":178.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":186.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":120117,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth B. is from the village of Villaflor, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.

She is 26 years old and lives in her own home with her four children: Ra\u00fal, 10; Miriam, 7; Yudith, 5; and Freddy, 1; who are the motivation for all her efforts. Josefa learned how to raise cattle from a very young age from her parents, who always worked very hard to give her a better life. Currently she has her own cattle, which she raises and feeds very well, since her family's economic income depends on it. What she most enjoys about her job is feeding her animals. She has been doing this for six years and considers transferring the cattle to the market where they are sold is the hardest part. In the future, she hopes to increase the heads of cattle she has and in this way increase her income. This is Josefa's second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she feels the responsibility to pay on time even if it means having to save little by little. She is a very active and supportive member of her community bank, which is why she is very respected by her fellow members. With the 2,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to buy a calf to rear and feed, and with the remainder of the money she will purchase feed for her cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":417324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a calf","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-30T03:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997706},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843127},{"amount":349.65,"local_amount":999,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734705},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":341.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992619}],"funded_date":"2009-10-30T12:34:29Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":153048,"name":"Thy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thy O. lives in Thommoney village in Takeo province.

A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.\r\n\r\nThe tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC. For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer. These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations. The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price.

He is married and the father of four children between the ages of 5 and 12. All children go to school. He lives in his own home with his family and doesn't support anyone other than them. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane to comply with mandatory military service and worked as a prison guard for five years. He later took \"Environmental Action\" classes and was designated as a service agent (guard) and responsible plant irrigation (from 5pm to 7am) in the Department of Agriculture of the Namaacha District making 1,900 meticais per month there. Besides working for the department, he has rendered gardening services at the Our Lady of Fatima Parish on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays mornings making 1,000 meticais. On Wednesdays and Saturdays he works in the informal marked where he has a business selling small construction materials such as different types of nails, power cables, switch boards and more.\r\n\r\nThis is Victorino's third loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva in the amount of 20,000 meticais. He intends to buy iron, nails, switch boards and other products to increase his inventory. The previous loans in the amount of 6,000 and 10,000 were used to increase the size and renovate her shop (hardware). \r\n\r\nHe is confident he will pay back the loan ahead of time and request a new loan to raise chickens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

He tells us that in his spare time he works as a laborer, harvesting coffee on other people's land, which makes him extra money.  He fights hard every day against his main problem which is a lack of working capital.  He owns five hectares of farmland but only produces crops on one hectare.  However, he has the support of his son for whom he bought a car so that he could provide a public transport service in their area.\r\n\r\nJorge hopes to achieve the goals that he has mapped out and start growing coffee, in order to diversify his production.

They have two children named Alya, aged 3 years, and Charly, aged 6 months. Ayub and family live in a simple house with a palm leaf roof, palm tree branches for walls and a cement floor. \r\n\r\nTo cover their living expenses, Ayub works as a shrimp fisherman. He has been running this business for 10 years. Ayub usually catches the shrimp in the early morning at 4 am using a trawl net and returns home at 11 am. In a day, Ayub can catch about 2 to 4 kilograms of shrimp and he sells them to his customers. The customers usually pay him at the end of month after they weight all his catch.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ayub cannot catch shrimp now since his trawl net is torn. He does not have money to buy a new trawl net or even to fix the old one. Therefore, he is seeking a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 10,000,000. He plans to spend the loan on some trawl nets to stock and another boat to support his work. Ayub really expects that TLM is willing to assist him with the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":885768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

O. is 49 years old, and is living with HIV within the Kibera slums of Nairobi. He is married and has two wives, one living with him in Kibera, and the other living with his aging mother back in his home village in Busia District, in the Western Province of Kenya. In total Charles has 11 children, two of which with his first wife, now deceased. Three of his children - all daughters - are married, but the other 8 children, together with his wives and his mother all depend on him.\r\n\r\nCharles started his hotel in 1999, after he got some savings money from his grocery shop, still in Kibera. He did this in order to diversify his business, and he has continued to run both businesses since. He works together with his wife in this business, and has also employed two employees to assist with the workload. Some of the favorite foods that he serves in his hotel include mandazi (similar to doughnuts), chapatti (a kind of unleavened bread made from wheat flour), beef stew, fish, ugali (A paste made from a mixture of maize meal and water), beans and githeri (made from a mixture of maize and beans boiled together then fried). Charles is a member of the Agape group of Action Now Kenya, within the Kibera slums, and has so far received loans of $57 and $85, which he used to buy stock for his hotel. Charles also received $115 from his group, which he used to buy 2 bags of cement and sand to plaster the walls of the hotel for better presentation. Charles has also been trained by ANK on living with HIV\/AIDS, and has learnt about small business management and operation, together with loan management. \r\n\r\nGiven the loan of $225, which is repayable within a period of 8 \u2013 14 months, Charles intends to completely refurbish his hotel by fabricating a new set of chairs and tables which will be designed to save space through the sitting arrangement. This will be the first phase where two tables, with six seats each, will be fabricated. Once the loan is repaid, he intends to borrow an additional loan to make another two tables, to ensure that he has a sitting capacity of 24 people at any one time. Currently his hotel can only sit about 10 customers, yet he feels that there is space to accommodate more people. Through this support, Charles will be assured of additional income, due to the extra business created through the sitting arrangement in the hotel. Charles also hopes that in future as the business continues to expand, his hotel will create additional job opportunities for more people within the Kibera slums. He also intends in future on expanding by buying a television set and video machine, through which to attract more customers, and to also provide some educational information for his customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":17420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of furniture to refurbish the hotel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-05T00:37:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-19T04:11:51Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":225,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:17:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24151},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:18:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33366},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:18:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44086},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:18:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56065},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:19:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69033},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:20:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83164},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98857}],"funded_date":"2007-03-05T05:11:51Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":12,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":9517,"name":"Josephine N.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Josephine is married with six children; three are in primary school and three have finished schooling.

With determination, hard work and self confidence they have raised above poverty. Mrs Di\u1ec7n is 35 years old. She joined TYM 5 years ago. She had a business plan and she was quite certain to success.After much discussion with her husband, they had decided to invest in fish farming which would yield high profit. Beside that they also cultivated vegetables (1\/2 acre), planted 100 grapefruit plats and built a pig pen to raise pigs. After numerous rounds of loans, they have riped fruit from their hard work. They have overcome poverty. Now they are living comfortably. They manage their farm following the VAC process. Their annual income is 2000-2500 USD. Her wish is to remain TYM member, continuing to expand her business. This time she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nC\u0169ng g\u1eb7p kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n nh\u01b0 nhi\u1ec1u gia \u0111\u00ecnh kh\u00e1c trong c\u1ee5m nh\u01b0ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Di\u1ec7n, 35 tu\u1ed5i, th\u1ef1c s\u1ef1 \u0111i l\u00ean nh\u1edd s\u1ef1 t\u1ef1 tin, m\u1ea1nh d\u1ea1n, d\u00e1m ngh\u0129 d\u00e1m l\u00e0m. 5 n\u0103m tr\u01b0\u1edbc, tuy m\u1edbi tham gia Qu\u1ef9 nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 bi\u1ebft suy ngh\u0129 t\u1eadn d\u1ee5ng \u0111i\u1ec1u ki\u1ec7n \u0111ang c\u00f3 \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 d\u1ef1 \u00e1n \u0111\u1ea1t hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3 kinh t\u1ebf cao.

She lives in her parents\u2019 home, and they helped her start her business.  She is a very happy young woman and is concerned with getting ahead.  For this reason she decided to open a liquor store with the help of her parents.  The store is very busy because she sells her products at good prices.  She likes her work and enjoys advising her customers on the best quality of liquor that they can buy.  She would like to have a bigger store where she could sell all kinds of liquors, and in this way increase her income.  She has been doing this work for two years and the most difficult part is getting the liquor because there are many counterfeit liquors and liquors of bad quality, so she must know how to differentiate them.  This is the first loan that she has requested from Kiva partner MFP, and she wants to pay it on time as she plans to take out other loans in the future.  She is well-loved at her communal bank because she always gives great joy to the rest of the members.  With the 1,000 new soles loan she will buy more beverages to better stock her store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva

His children are growing up so he wants everyone to have their own bedroom so that each one can have privacy. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":446386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Pay for materials & labor required to finish the bedrooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-12-11T19:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":666.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":671.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077821},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":671.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123914073},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":671.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949731},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":671.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678556},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":671.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712981},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":671.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152048323},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":671.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636856},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":671.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850977},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":2666.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2685.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258889}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T04:01:40Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T08:50:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":165473,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"37-year-old Juliet is married with four children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She wants to increase the number of chairs she has because of the high customer demand for renting chairs for their parties in this season. The amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan of $3,000 from FATEN. When Fatema gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase chairs and increase the number of rental chairs.

Both of her daughters are married and on their own. Since 2000, Altantsetseg has made a living selling children\u2019s clothing at the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She started out by renting a small stall but has done a good job of increasing her capital and attracting more customers. Today she has many regular customers who enjoy doing business with her. She is applying for a loan for 1,200,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) to buy more children\u2019s clothes to sell this autumn and winter.

Subsistence is always a battle in this arid region, where most people still depend on rain-fed cultivation of their staple crops: millet, yams and peanuts.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.  Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.  However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.  This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.  Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Irrigation pump","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-11-04T17:46:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alioune","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-19T03:13:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T02:06:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10817},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T21:55:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13108},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16912},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16928},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16944},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16960},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2007-05-29T19:35:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":18496},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41445},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50186},{"amount":855,"local_amount":855,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":855,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63339}],"funded_date":"2006-11-05T03:13:17Z","paid_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5437,"name":"Abigail","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abigail is a hairdresser.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":483045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Kalala has many years of experience in this business.  Kalala needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kalala joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Kalala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kalala P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Development Group-Lugazi. She is 40 years old and happily married with two kids, both of whom are attending school in Namengo-Lugazi. \r\n\r\nTo get a viable and sustainable financial means of subsistence that she and her family could rely on, she began her fish selling business two years ago. To take root in this business, she had to use savings from her bar business, which is still a side business for her. In a week, out of her fish business, she makes profits totaling up to 500,000 shillings.  \r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of this loan, Fatuma wants to boost her business by buying more fish to resell and some to smoke and keep as reserve just in case client demand goes up. Just like in any other part of Uganda, fish customers in Lugazi normally have preferences, some an inclination for smoked fish and some fancy fresh fish. The upshot of increased sales, Fatuma gleefully says, is going to be an increase in profits for her business.

From very early in the morning she opens her store hoping that neighbors will come to buy the things they need.\r\n\r\nShe is a very cheerful and attentive vendor, always welcoming guests with a smile and willing to help them with their purchases. What she likes about her job is talking with her neighbors. She has been running this business for one year now and believes that the hardest part is having to spend all day in the shop without the possibility of leaving.\r\n\r\nOver time, she hopes to expand her store and fill it with more merchandise to offer customers a better variety of products. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is willing to pay all her dues on time, as she does not want to cause problems for the community bank, which is beloved by the other members. \r\n\r\nWith the additional 1200 soles requested she will buy more products to improve her store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":629635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy more products to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-04T06:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349785}],"funded_date":"2010-11-04T19:37:05Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":248024,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolas is 35 years old.

This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase new materials for fishing. She wants to continue to save up for the future, sustain their daily needs and provide for the education of her children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He\u2019s been selling seafood for the last two years.  He and his life companion decided to go into this business together because of the need to earn income to subsist.  Julio and his life companion buy fish and shrimp in one of the country\u2019s ports every week.  They prepare their coolers with enough ice and place 50 pounds of shrimp and 50 pounds of fish in them.  They buy directly from the fishermen so they earn a good profit margin.\r\n\r\nHe is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy larger amounts of fish and shrimp because they sell it quickly and at a good price because they\u2019ve staked out a market in the north of the country where fish and shrimp are scarce.  To go sell there they take up to three buses with their merchandise and it takes an entire day to sell their merchandise.\r\n\r\nJulio sees the seafood selling business as quite a good source of income but at the same time it requires much sacrifice so he plans to save up some of the income he earns to be able to buy himself a car to have his own means of transportation and sell his seafood faster.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":894571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She got pregnant when she was 16 which obliged her to quit school.  The father of her son refused to assume responsibility so Catarina had to arrange for another husband.  With their first child something went wrong, and since she was unable to have more children she was rejected for the second time.  She decided to return to her mother's house and never married again.<p>She started an business to sell various products and gradually was able to build a home.  Catarina has lived for 6 years raising chickens.  She works alone, learned from a friend and has 6 years of experience.  She has an average monthly production of 300 chickens which equates to about 3,000MT per month. <p>This is the second loan with Hluvuku and she had one with the Tchuma cooperative.  The first loan with Hluvuku was for 10,200MT and the second will be for 16,000MT.  All proceeds are for raising chickens.  She came to know Hluvuku through a friend who was already a client.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling different kinds of vegetables in the local community. Alma has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used for additional capital to buy more vegetables to sell. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to buy additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixteenth loan taken out by Alma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Norma Garc\u00eda is 42 years old, married, and has two young daughters.  Sra. Norma operates a firewood business from her home.  This is not a small business since she has to buy large pieces of firewood and is responsible for splitting them into smaller logs before distributing them to nearby stores or selling them at the market. She has 15 years of experience in this business.  However, it is important to mention that she also had a grocery store, but she had to close it down because too many customers purchased on credit and never paid her.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Norma is requesting a loan so that she can expand her business.  Her dream has always been to prepare her daughters so that they could study at the university and provide them a better life with all the conveniences.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She is 40 years old. Jovita is widowed and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling coco and wood charcoal in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jovita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional charcoal to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jovita from HSPFI.

They all live in a little house that\u2019s humble but theirs.  Since childhood Mateo has been farming, an activity that has provided sustenance to support his family all this time.  His children are strong enough now to help him with the field work so the entire family, including Antonia, works hard in the fields.  \r\n\r\nHis main crop is peas since that\u2019s what earns the most income but he also grows potatoes, lima beans and corn.  The main difficulty this tireless father faces throughout his life is the lack of capital to expand his crops and produce in larger quantities, a situation he\u2019s been managing thanks to the coordinated work with his communal bank.
