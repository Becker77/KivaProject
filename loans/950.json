Four years ago she opened her grocery store, a business which has been a great advantage for her family and for the people who live in her area.

She has taken out and repaid her one loan successfully. This lady is very hard working and is determined to educate all four of her children at the higher level of education. She is involved with buying and selling fashion dresses in Mbon Market Park Mbengwi and promises that if given the new loan she will expand her business by adding jewelry, sandals, ladies slippers and also baby wear. She is very positive that her business will succeed because the demand for her fashions is very high in that locality. She has regular customers and she always supplies goods to them at low prices so that they can resale and make their own profit. She has been running the business for five years and understands the techniques and tactics needed to capture and maintain both old and new customers. She strongly believes that from this business activity, the community will benefit from low prices, regular supplies and availability of high quality products.\r\nWith the profit generated from this loan, Mercy Ijang promises to further the education of her children and grandchildren, improve the living standard of her family with the support of her husband and provide medication to the family.

She has five children and has been doing agricultural work for 15 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, crops, and transportation services. She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is being her own boss and feeding the cows is her passion. Her biggest challenge is the high cost of inputs and animal feeds. Animals on the farm have been given the names of lelgina, cheptuigong, asyier, lelmet.  In local language these mean white tummy, dark eyes, black and white one and the one with the white forehead, respectively.\r\n\r\nJane chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan after hearing about the program from existing members. This client learned about credit management during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. As a result of the loan, Jane said her income will increase and she will be able to educate her children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jane owns the following: cow, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle but does not own pig, automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and running water but does not have electricity, solar power, sewing machine, TV, DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1187047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She has one child, and she has been in farming for four years.  Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and crops, which all go to the local market, and her employment salary. She will use the loan to buy irrigation pipes\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming:  \"She loves keeping poultry and loves seeing chicks grow to big hens!\" Her biggest challenge is \"poultry diseases, which sometimes bring a lot of loses.\" The dairy cow on the farm has been named \"Lelmet,\" which refers to one with white forehead.\r\n\r\nRuth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"She heard from existing members.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session:  \"She has learnt about record keeping.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Ruth replied:  \"From the loan, she will be able to get more income and thus feed her family well and educate her child.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ruth owns the following:  a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does NOT have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Ella recuerda que  inici\u00f3 su  negocio el 26 de Mayo del 2011,  atendiendo la sugerencia de sus amigos y porque adem\u00e1s posee conocimientos en los productos de belleza y que su negocio poco a poco ha ido ganando muchos clientes, porque adem\u00e1s de vender producto capilares, tambi\u00e9n ofrece secadores, planchas de cabellos, queratinas, masajes capilares, champoo, silicona  y perfumer\u00eda. Wendy realiza sus ventas a cr\u00e9dito, de lunes a domingos y trabaja hasta que el cliente lo requiera. Para realizar su estrategia comercial,  visita a sus potenciales compradores y tiene una gu\u00eda especializada mediante la cual ofrece sus productos, los clientes solicitan el pedido y ella a su vez pide la mercanc\u00eda a su proveedor de revistas, para responder el pedido,  en un periodo de tiempo promedio no mayor de 30 d\u00edas. Sus  clientes son sus vecinos, amigos y referidos que compran a ella con mucha frecuencia. Su principal meta es alcanzar el doble de su clientela y por eso se esmera en darle una pronta respuesta a ella, pero su principal desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para lograr responder a sus expectativas de acortar el tiempo de respuesta lo cual le impide crecer. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 secadores, planchas, masajes, productos capilares perfumer\u00eda y productos de limpieza capilar. Con su credikiva, lograr\u00e1 tener un stock de mercanc\u00eda con el cual reducir el tiempo de respuesta de su clientela y poco a poco, contar con un capital de trabajo independiente para estar mucho mas holgada.  ","en":"Wendy, 21, sells beauty products to customers from her house, where she lives with her husband in the southwestern part of the city. She started the business on May 26, 2011 at the suggestion of her friends and because she was knowledgeable about cosmetics. Slowly, she built a client base because, in addition to selling hair care products, she offered dryers, hair irons, keratins, hair massagers, shampoo, silicone solutions, and perfumes.\r\n\r\nWendy sells on credit and works from Monday to Sunday as her customers need her. Her business strategy is to visit her potential customers and show them a catalog of products. Customers place their orders, and then she orders the merchandise from the suppliers. On average, the orders are filled in no more than 30 days. Her customers are her neighbors, friends, and referrals who buy regularly. Her main goal is to double her client base and, therefore, she strives to respond quickly to her customers. Her main challenge, however, is insufficient working capital to respond promptly to her cutomers' needs, which impedes her growth. Therefore, she has requested a Kiva loan to buy dryers, irons, massagers, hair care products, perfumes, and shampoos. The loan will allow her to keep stock and reduce the response time to her customers' orders. Slowly, she will build her own working capital and be more comfortable.

She has two daughters, who she raised and educated on her own.  A number of years ago, she separated from her long-term partner.  She now lives in her own home and works a lot; she wants to give a better quality of life to her daughters and to her 4-year old grandson, who she is raising. \r\n\r\nDoris works selling second-hand clothing.  She selects the garments that are in the best condition, then separates the women's from the men's, and finally distributes the clothing, both children's and adult's.  On a weekly basis, Doris travels with a friend to the villages and out-lying towns to sell her merchandise.  She has been in this business for over 13 years, and it is going very well.  Additionally, Doris has a small grocery that she runs out of her home.  Doris likes her work because she can travel to different places and bring back various products that the people give to her or that she trades for in the villages.  Doris recalls that she started her business because her household's low income meant that she couldn't give her daughters a good education.  But since she started working at her current business, things have gotten a lot better. \r\n\r\nThis is Doris's second loan with MFP, and she is grateful for all those who have made it possible for her to get a loan.  She feels satisfied with her communal bank; she feels that it's a united and supportive group.\r\nWith the sum she has requested of 2000 soles (USD $775), Doris will purchase more clothing for her business.  She will also purchase fruit, sweets and beverages for her grocery store.

Her greatest dream is to raise her son and offer him a good quality of life and better economic opportunities to move forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1177977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a fast-food cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caldas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71336},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73321},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75361},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77459},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79614},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81830},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86447},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88853},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91326},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93867},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96479}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.08,"local_amount":67962,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70731.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617825},{"amount":42.25,"local_amount":73474,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76468.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640738},{"amount":45.18,"local_amount":78582,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81784.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029847},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":73360,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76349.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165926},{"amount":48.14,"local_amount":83713,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87124.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548473},{"amount":358.17,"local_amount":622909,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":648292.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098362}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T15:01:41Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":465834,"name":"Marleny Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marleny aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven la actividad de la confecci\u00f3n y consigui\u00f3 trabajo r\u00e1pidamente en una empresa, y as\u00ed contribu\u00eda econ\u00f3micamente con sus padres para tener una mejor calidad de vida en el hogar.

To generate the household income he needs he has a repair shop for motors for lawnmowers and other agricultural machines.\r\n\r\nThe idea of his business came up when a customer told him that this type of shop was not easy to find.  This made the overhead for transporting the parts desirable for a nearby business.  This was how Yonar, with his experience and having studied mechanics, decided to set up his motor-repair business.\r\n\r\nSince he set up his shop, his family's quality of life has improved considerably and his daughters have been able to get a better education.  Nevertheless, he still has a lot of problems with capital in his business, so he's looking for a loan to buy the parts he needs to repair motors and shelves for storing the parts and his tools.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to get his family ahead, giving his daughters a better education and a better quality of life at

His biggest challenge is lack of enough capital for expansion. The dairy cow on the farm has been named Mukie.\r\n\r\nKipkurgut was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied he found out from church by a friend.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session and he said he learnt about how to invest the loan from Juhudi.\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked how this loan would benefit his family, Kipkurgut replied he would get milk for the family and sell the surplus, thus increasing his income.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Kipkurgut owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1187109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

North West region of Cameroon. Being a single mother, she has faced many difficulties in life which include inadequate funds to take care of her children including providing them with medication, adequate education and other necessities of life.\r\n\r\nSince she joined GHAPE in the year 1998, her life has become a success story. She can now be proud of educating her children, having a poultry farm to call her own, and she is also engaged in gardening. She has taken out and repaid her loans 14 times and says, if given the new loan, she will expand her business, add more chicks to her poultry farm and also do a table business. She holds the positive view that her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business. She has attended seminars on poultry farming and says the community will have quality products at low prices from her business. Her products will be available to them at all times. Also, she will give credit to trustworthy customers.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from her business, she will educate her children, provide medication for her family, add a room to her compound and also engage in the production of fruits like watermelon, pineapple, lime and lemon. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, convenient repayment intervals, availability of a loan when in demand, and the education of members before the loans are disbursed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1187086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

is a widow with six children and they live in Mbengwi Momo Division, North West Region, Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life including poverty and ill health. She faced the death of her husband leaving her with no choice but to provide medication, education and three square meals to her children alone.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 1999 and has taken out and repaid loans 11 times. If given the new loan requested, she promises to buy chicks, feed for the chicks, chick medication and also get involved in a little bit of agriculture. From this activity, her community will develop widely. She will convince community members to buy the chicks and keep them to resell, so as to make profit. She will supply at low prices and also supply some on occasions warranting the need for chicken meat. She holds the positive view that her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business, experience and commitment.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will educate her children, provide medication for her children and also take care of other children of the family. She says GHAPE loans are preferable because of the low interest rate and no collateral before loan

With the new loan requested, he plans to buy more provisions like bags of rice, cartons of soap, cartons of maggi and other items.  He holds strongly to the fact that his business will succeed because he has regular customers, he has been doing it for a long time and he is the only person who sells such items in that locality.  From this business, the community will have regular supply at all times, credit facilities will be offered to regular customers, goods will be sold at reduced prices and a variety of goods will be made available to the community to enable them to consume what they desire, not what they find available.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, he plans to educate his children, buy medication for his family and make sure his family eats well to avoid many illnesses.

She has been in this business for five years. However, her yields have been limited due to unpredictable weather (flood or drought). To supplement her income, she also sells Vietnamese crepes. Chea's group is composed of two members; both are first-time borrowers with VisionFund. Chea is applying for 1,000,000 KHR and her co-member is asking for 600,000 KHR. As the leader, Chea will use her portion of the loan to buy more non-perishable ingredients to support her food-selling business.

This city has colonial and modern architecture and a cold climate, and the people there are hardworking and still preserve the culture and traditions of their communities.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Nube, who's on her third loan with this communal bank.  She lives near the Jaime Roldos residential complex in the city of Cuenca.  She's 46 and married, and has six children from this relationship.  Two of her daughters are married and live independently, two of her children work and help her financially, and the last two attend school in the town.  Her husband's a professional driver who drives a school bus.  Together they built the house they live in.\r\n\r\nNube works taking care of her home and family.  Also, to help her household financially she works in business selling clothing, cosmetics, and plastic Tupperware products.  She has done this work for 10 years and she works from Monday through Saturday with no fixed schedule.\r\n\r\nShe's going to invest her new loan in buying clothing, cosmetics, and Tupperware products to have more variety for her customers.\r\n\r\nAs she's a small businesswoman, her goal is to continue growing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1178060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

To add more income, she also raises pigs at home, while her husband works as a paid worker. From the current business that she has been with for several years, she is able to earn about 22,000 KHR per day and save about 16,000 KHR each day for future needs. However, the main challenge for her rice is drought, which lowers her yield. \r\n\r\nLang received her first loan with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund, three cycles ago, while her other group member has been with VisionFund for one cycle. The past loans have helped her better support her current business. \r\n\r\nShe is now leading her group of two to request a loan with VisionFund. With her portion, she is going to buy fertilizers for her farmland and build on her savings to renovate her house.

provide a high-quality life and moral path for his family. He is married and the responsible father of four school-aged children. Someday he hopes to offer them a higher level of education. Nath farms rice and he uses his spare time to run a recycling business for additional income. From the two businesses, he is able to generate a suitable income of 18,000 KHR each day while his spouse earns about 12,000 KHR each day from her hog-raising business.\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain his recycling business, Nath needs additional capital for a large purchase of recycled materials.

She sells soft drinks during the week and detergents and other household products at weekends.  She says that she has operated the business for 10 years and enjoys mixing with her customers.  She tells us, too, that she struggled at first because she had a clothing sales business before that barely paid and, consequently, she was reluctant to start another business.\r\n\r\nThis is Juanita's first MFP loan.

All family members work hard, but they still don\u2019t have enough income to make some savings and improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrma is requesting a loan to purchase wheat seeds. She will sow more wheat, harvest and sell at a good price. This will increase the income of the family and that will hopefully improve the family's living

He and his wife, Dora, have three grown children.  They live together, along with a young grandson, in a house that they scrimped and saved to own.  \r\n\r\nKreiver operates a mototaxi business.  He started the business 15 years ago with a loan and his own savings.  Mototaxis quickly wear down from daily use and Kreiver has had to repair and replace his over the years.  He says that he likes the business because it provides a steady income for supporting his family.  He adds that he started it because there was no paid work at the time and he needed a way to make a living.  For the best, as it turns out, because he likes being his own boss and setting his own hours.  His greatest challenge, he says, is maintaining his vehicle.  When the mototaxi breaks down, he has to figure out how to repair it quickly so that he can go back to work.   \r\n\r\nThis is Kreiver's second MFP loan.  He is grateful, he says, that you are willing to help him meet his goals.  He adds that he likes his community bank because its members are helpful and supportive.  \r\nKreiver will use part of this 1000 new soles loan to carry out vehicle repairs--new seat covers, etc.--and the rest to save for his next mototaxi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1178170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Manzura's first loan from IMON International. She is a conscientious and hard-working young woman. Manzura was born in the countryside in the family of a shepherd, and even as a child helped her father raise livestock. In 1997, she entered the first grade of secondary school. She was a good student, actively participated in extracurricular activities, and successfully finished grade 11 in 2008. In that same year she became a correspondence student at the Tajik Technological University. When Manzura was in her third year of university studies, her only brother was suddenly taken ill and needed a large sum of money for his medical treatment. As Manzura's father is a shepherd and her mother is a nurse, they were unable to find such funds. At the same time, the family needed to pay for Manzura's education. After paying his only son's medical bills, Manzura's father was unable to cover her tuition, and Manzura was expelled from university. Despite this setback, this year she has enrolled in the Tajik State University. \r\n\r\nManzura's family has no source of income other that her mother's salary. For this reason, Manzura has turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to pay her tuition. She is counting on your financial support and would like to receive higher education in order to serve her country in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1190506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for her university studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-09-08T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-08T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":420,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.3,"local_amount":67.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-28T10:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":68.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316392180},{"amount":32.85,"local_amount":32.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":32.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162670},{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":68.86,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740552},{"amount":72.63,"local_amount":71.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":72.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801589},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":34.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":34.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915142},{"amount":36.7,"local_amount":36.27,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":36.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381692892},{"amount":36.93,"local_amount":36.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":36.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555692},{"amount":73.01,"local_amount":72.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":73.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549581}],"funded_date":"2012-09-08T18:10:44Z","paid_date":"2013-09-21T08:50:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":469046,"name":"Raul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raul is 34 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She has successfully used her past loans to relieve her family\u2019s financial burden with the income that she has received for the improvement of her business. \r\n\r\nNow Chek and her fellow group member are seeking a loan with VisionFund in amount of 1,400,000 riels (KHR) and 1,000,000 KHR respectively. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her cassava field and use a part of her loan to help her children start up a fish-selling business. Chek hopes this loan will enable her to increase her income to improve her family\u2019s standard of living and also hopes to help her children to have a proper business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1187034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers for her cassava business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-08T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-08T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Touch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":2400000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2433000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197229}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T12:11:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:31:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":469065,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane has operated her retail business in Nakuru town for the last two years.

Her partner is Eduardo, with whom she has eight children, whose ages range from 10 to 20 years old. They currently live with only five of them. This family lives in a house of their own, located in an indigenous community of the forested central part of the country. \r\n\r\nDina is a farmer, and she has three plots of land where she grows coffee, plantains and yuca. Coffee production is profitable, and for that reason she has to cultivate it all year. The money she obtains is sufficient to cover her daily expenses, to invest in the next planting, and to save some. At the same time, the plantains are the key to her daily sustenance, because the harvests are weekly. The yucas are primarily used for her family's daily consumption. With the help of Eduardo and her older children, she is able to optimize her work and make it more pleasant. About her communal bank and its activities, she remarks that \"The educational talks also help us a lot.\" \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP, and for her part she is committed to making her payments punctually. She also expresses gratitude and identification with her communal bank, \u201cFlor de San Juan.\u201d\r\n \r\nShe will invest the funds from this loan in paying the laborers whom she will contract to clean up her fields, since harmful weeds frequently invade her coffee plantings, impeding the growth of her crops.

The crops cultivated will serve the community as food, and because she keeps animals, the manure will be used for fertilizing the farm and as such she will have good yields. She will also sell to her friend, who will resell in the Bamenda food market. From this business, the community will benefit from low-price, high-quality farm produce and availability at all times.\r\n\r\nShe promises that the profit from the loan will be used for family medication and to buy other commodities which she cannot produce; also payment of her children\u2019s school fees and purchase of books.

She is single and the only one responsible for her children's well-being, since she has no help.  Marina sells products by catalogue, such as perfumes, make-up, hair color and other items.  Her business is fairly stable since she has many customers who consume her products on a monthly basis.  \r\n\r\nShe works door-to-door and visits each household where she shows her catalogues.  This is how she earns a living to feed, educate, cloth and do even more for her children.  This is why she is requesting a loan to buy a wider variety of cosmetics and have different products to offer her customers.  Marina sells to most of them on credit so she needs a certain amount of money to invest in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1178539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cosmetics for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-09-08T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-08T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":21.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":21.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":22.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":23.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":28.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":63.86,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":63.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308350041},{"amount":22.82,"local_amount":22.82,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":22.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321403},{"amount":23.43,"local_amount":23.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":23.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929951},{"amount":24.46,"local_amount":24.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":24.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331925079},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":25.12,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846204},{"amount":26.13,"local_amount":26.13,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004104},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":27.42,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":27.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447523},{"amount":28.26,"local_amount":28.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450702},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":28.8,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":28.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382264813},{"amount":29.7,"local_amount":29.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":29.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411737732}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T00:59:48Z","paid_date":"2013-10-25T08:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":469101,"name":"Silvestra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Silvestra is 47 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is married to Rodrigo and they have eight children, but they are all independent adults now.\r\n\r\nFarming gave her the satisfaction of giving her the income to help educate her children, who are now living in the city of Lima.  She grows corn, peas, and barley on her own land and on rented land.  She sells each harvest in the country's capital, where her children help her out with contacts.  She also has five cows, all of them diary cows, that produce an average of 35 liters per day.  Her livestock is doing very well; her secret is that she grows the alfalfa that is their main food source herself.  She also tells us that she gives them animal feed, de-worms them, and checks on them a lot.  \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP and the help she receives puts her at ease.  She is also thankful for the trust they have placed in her and she promises to make her payments on time, as she would not let down this association made up of supportive, responsible people.\r\n\r\nM\u00e1xima will use this money to buy natural fertilizers to scatter on her alfalfa plantings, as well as feed for her animals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1178834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They own the house they live in; she built it together with her ex-husband.\r\n\r\nShe has a 20 hectare plot of land that she bought 13 years ago with the help of her ex-husband. She has different plantings of vegetables and fruits like cassava, banana, lemon, oranges, and chilis.

Her business continues to grow little by little; she even has customers in other cities. She has been in this business for about ten years and she works with the help of her children and two laborers. She likes country life; she has lived in that environment since she was very little, learning from her parents, so she feels very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Loyda's third loan with the MFP institution and she is very happy to know that she has financial support. That way, she feels sure of making progress in her business. In return, she promises to once again repay her loan in a punctual manner. She is also pleased to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe will invest amount she is requesting\u20141500 nuevos soles (PEN)\u2014in expanding her cassava planting. She will hire the necessary labor and she will buy cassava cuttings.

La producci\u00f3n actual que obtiene de su cultivo le genera las ganancias suficientes para sobrellevar los gastos b\u00e1sicos que se presentan diariamente; sin embargo, considera que no es suficiente para poder invertir en otros negocios o para aumentar la extensi\u00f3n de siembra. Es por eso que ha incursionado en el rubro de la construcci\u00f3n trabajando como alba\u00f1il, desde hace 9 meses, y le est\u00e1 yendo muy bien, con el dinero que obtiene de este trabajo, m\u00e1s lo obtenido de la venta de yuca espera aumentar el \u00e1rea cultivada. \n\nEste es su tercer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, por lo tanto agradece a todas las personas que siguen confiando en \u00e9l para acceder nuevamente a este financiamiento que le ayudar\u00e1 a aumentar su capital de trabajo. Sabe que nuevamente tendr\u00e1 que ser muy responsable, y sobre todo muy puntual, est\u00e1 contento de pertenecer su banco comunal, ya que ve que son muy solidarios.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 1200 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 plomada, paletas y esp\u00e1tulas que necesita para desarrollar su trabajo de alba\u00f1il con mejores resultados.","en":"Juan is 23 years old and a jovial, responsible and hard-working man. He is single and does not have any children. \r\n\r\nHe lives alone in a house which he built with much hard-work a number of years ago.  He works in agriculture, specifically in growing cassava. He has land which he inherited from his parents. He has been working growing this product for 10 years and relies on the help of two people, who support him with all of the labour. \r\n\r\nHis current production generates enough income to cover his basic daily expenses. Nevertheless, he considers it insufficient to allow him to invest in other businesses or to extend his cultivation area. For this reason, 9 months ago he started working as a bricklayer. It is going well for him. With the money he obtains from this work, in addition to that obtained from the sale of cassava, he hopes to extend his cultivation area. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and for this reason he is grateful to all of the people who continue believing in him to obtain this new loan, which will help him to increase his working capital. He knows that he will have to continue be responsible, and above all punctual. He is happy to be a member of his communal bank, as they are very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nWith the amount he is asking for of 1,200 nuevos soles, he will buy plummets, trowels and spatulas to carry out his work as a bricklayer more effectively.

He lives with his spouse in his own home which he was able to build with a lot of effort a number of years ago. \r\n\r\nHis business is agriculture; specifically he has made his living in the production of cassava for 6 years.  He has a 30 acre plot of land that he works on with help from his four workers that he hires depending on the amount of land that needs to be harvested or worked on. Previously, he would plant vegetables and other products, but they did not make good profits so he decided to make a change and now he does very well. He has a location in the market where he sells the cassava that he harvests. He feels happy with his job as he sees it as a very profitable business for now and it is what he has always done and the experience in the field has helped him a lot. In seeing the progress that he has made, he has chosen to expand his business by increasing the amount he currently sows. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP, he is grateful for all of the people that trust in him to have his loan that will help him increase his earnings at work.

However, Keo\u2019s children are very appreciative of their parents because of their hard work and sacrifices. They also help Keo in managing the farming business so as to reduce some expenses in labor costs.\r\n\r\nAs there is much work to handle at this time, Keo really needs to hire laborers to help her at the rice field and potato plantation. For this reason, Keo would like to acquire a loan from HKL and Kiva to pay for labor costs. She hopes that it will provide good results and let her earn a higher income in this coming season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1180054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for labor costs for the rice field and potato plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-09-09T05:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-09T05:00:10Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":506875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355835028},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":506875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420253906}],"funded_date":"2012-09-09T08:20:14Z","paid_date":"2013-11-19T10:00:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":466445,"name":"Ana Josefa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Josefa de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo quien es jubilado y de edad avanzada.
