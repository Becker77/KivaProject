Although she started her restaurant with very little capital, Maria has managed to overcome the difficulty of capital that she has with her effort and is offering every time better products to her customers. Thanks to her restaurant,  Maria has been contributing economically to her household to improve the quality of life at home where she lives with her husband and their five children in such a way that her children are able to access a better quality education and have been overcoming gradually the great financial difficulties that the family had.

Intentando superar la dificultad de capital que tiene, Jairo busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar materias primas como siliconas, recinas, algodones, entre otros m\u00e1s para seguir ofreciendo un buen servicio a sus clientes.\n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es poder separar su consultorio odontol\u00f3gico de su casa y as\u00ed ofrecerles una mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes. Adem\u00e1s, podr\u00e1 ofrecer una mejor calidad de vida a su familia y tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de seguir progresando junto a ellos. \n","en":"Jairo is a very hardworking person, thanks to which he has succeeded in getting ahead despite the great difficulties he has confronted in his life. Jairo is a dentist and has been engaged in this profession for the past 8 years. Thanks to his effort and dedication to his work he succeeded in opening his own dental office four years ago. Despite having little capital, his hard work enabled him to overcome the great obstacles he has encountered in his business and this has allowed him to continue moving forward while always looking for improved economic opportunities for his family. With the goal of solving his capital requirements, Jairo is requesting a loan to purchase basic supplies such as silicone, resin and cotton, among other items, in order to continuing providing the best service to his patients.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to be able to separate his dental office from his house and thus provide better care to his patients. As well, he would be able to provide his family a better quality of life and have the opportunity to continue succeeding along with them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1177933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dental","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to purchase basic supplies, such as silicone, resins and cotton, among other items, in order to continue offering good care to his patients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-09-09T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-09T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jairo Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57069},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58657},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60289},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61967},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63691},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65464},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67285},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69158},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71082},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73060},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75094},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.45,"local_amount":54136,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55117.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617820},{"amount":66.76,"local_amount":118684,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":120835.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640730},{"amount":1.8,"local_amount":3195,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3252.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029840},{"amount":69.63,"local_amount":123790,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126033.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165919},{"amount":1.05,"local_amount":1868,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1901.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548465},{"amount":280.31,"local_amount":498327,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":507359.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098355}],"funded_date":"2012-09-09T18:06:26Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":466495,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de tienda de abarrotes,la socia vende productos de primera necesidad como arroz,azucar,leche y galletas,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,la socia es una mujer emprendedora que el sue\u00f1o que tiene es que sus hijos terminen de estudiar y sean profesionales,la socia ya tiene 5 a\u00f1os en este negocio,en sus tiempos libres a la socia le gusta salir con sus hijos a pasear.La socia solicita el credito para comprar arroz,azucar,leche y galletas al por mayor.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"The member continues to be dedicated to her grocery store business.

After years of work in this sector, she was able to buy a market stall, which significantly helps her save money on rent at the moment. Her best selling items are blouses, jackets, and sweaters. \r\n\r\nOlga needs an additional 10,000 griven in order to purchase women's fall and winter clothing. She cannot always count on getting a loan from local loan institutions because they are reluctant to give loans to people approaching retirement age. Therefore, a Kiva loan is a real solution for Olga's problem and naturally, a godsend for the development of her business.

She lives in Paz Centro, which is an area with many traditional specialities such as cheesecake, tiste (a sweetcorn and cocoa drink), and the making of tile bricks. The people are very welcoming, humble and simple, but very hardworking. Maritza has an industrial grinder, which she rents out to people in the area who need to grind sweetcorn in order to make all the various typical foods that use it as an ingredient: tiste, pinolillo (a similar drink, but sweeter), tamales, g\u00fcirilas (a sort of sweetcorn pancake). She keeps the grinder in her house and has been in this line of business for ten years. Her mother taught her how to operate the grinder and derive an income from it. Her mother, who is now very old and sick, gave it to her so that she could continue the family business. In spite of these difficulties, Maritza's business is faring reasonably well.

I've managed to bring a few of my relatives in my village to join me in Accra. I make the designs, they carve them, and I finish them. My experience as a carver helps me judge when a piece has been properly carved, so I also do quality control.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank everyone involved in this microcredit for thinking about me and for giving me this opportunity.

I did not realize that it was the beginning of a career. Then we received an order for carved oware games and within four weeks I had developed and mastered my own style. Now I also enjoy researching the game and its history. I wrote 'The Rules for Playing Oware' booklet, a practical manual officially recognized by the Oware Society in London and Ghana.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assistance such as this microcredit will encourage me to produce new items and improve my cash flow.

Nevertheless, I have taken several textile courses.  My work focuses on resuscitating our ancestral culture and linking it to the present.  I work with my family, and our materials include wool, cotton, and both natural and artificial dyes.

Marita lives with her longtime partner and their two children. She and her partner work together in order to make a living. While she is busy selling frozen foods, her partner works at a slaughterhouse, where he is the butcher. According to Marita, her partner is able to earn about 400 Philippine pesos (PHP) daily as his compensation for being the butcher. Her partner also buys and sells pigs, earning about 2,500 PHP a week.\r\n\r\nMarita's children go to school already, so she needs to work hard in order to send them to a higher level of education. She's hoping that her food sales business will continue to grow so she can obtain greater income for the bright future of her two children.

He lives next to his parents, who help him a lot with his work. \r\n\r\nAlep is very excited to have his own small business selling and raising laying hens and selling eggs. He devotes about nine hours a day to his business, then goes to class at night. He thinks that the business will go well because he has a lot of determination and, above all, because he is friendly with his customers. \r\n\r\nAlep is very grateful for the Kiva loans, since thanks to their help he has been able to buy more hens and prepare a larger corral . In this way, his business has been able to grow more and he has been able to improve his profits. At the same time, he will continue fighting each day to make his dream come true - to finish his education and grow his business.

Nancy is 33 years old and lives in a common-law relationship. She has five children aged 17, 15, 11, 8, and 4, all of whom attend high school, primary school, or kindergarten. Her partner is a businessman.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Nancy learned how to sew and make clothes in a nearby college, and now she uses her knowledge and earns her own money. She opened a small sewing workshop in her home and makes all kinds of clothing, but only in the evenings and at weekends as during the rest of the week she works as a seamstress in a workshop in the centre of town and receives a weekly wage. Nancy works every day from 6 am to 6 pm in the workshop and then at home  until 9 or 10 o\u2019 clock at night, sometimes even later when she has orders to complete.  She\u2019s been doing this for eight years so she can have money of her own which comes in handy to help with her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used partly to pay for a sewing machine that Nancy bought some time ago, and partly for fabric and other sewing supplies. She is in her third loan cycle with her Community Bank and likes the system because the loans are made quickly and without too much red tape. Her dream is to have her own workshop in the centre of town with some employees to help her. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1179744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for a sewing machine, fabric, and sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-10T01:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-10T01:10:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150609},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383711},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990714},{"amount":210,"local_amount":210,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":210,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127089},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517616}],"funded_date":"2012-09-11T23:19:25Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":470216,"name":"Dieu Est Grand Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe DIEU EST GRAND est form\u00e9 de cinq personnes qui exercent la m\u00eame activit\u00e9.

For nearly fifteen years, she has been selling plastic bags, condiments, and rice out of her home and via the distribution system. She does her work with passion, and this enables her to meet her needs and those of her children. She gets her supplies  from a market in Benin and from Nigeria.\r\n\r\nSeeking to satisfy her customers and with the aim of increasing her working capital, Mariam is requesting, along with the other members of the group MIWONONVI, a loan that will be used to respond better to customer demands and to make more profit.

She works as a cook in a local school and, as a supplementary source of income for her family, cultivates crops and raises livestock, having started her business 13 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kulnasiyna's hard work, her herd presently includes 2 cows with offspring, 15 goats and sheep, as well as 2 horses, while the monthly income from her business amounts to roughly 6,000 som (KGS). Kulnasiyna's business profits have allowed her to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Kulnasiyna has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase 2 cows and 8 sheep or goats for fattening and resale. She plans to reinvest her profits from this loan into her business by purchasing a plot of land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1192088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Jar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-09-10T14:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-10T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":37.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulnasiyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5040.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071237},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10081,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862928},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013814},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10081,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942370},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749280},{"amount":1130.76,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":55445.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":37.99,"payment_id":529946683}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T20:04:04Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":469633,"name":"Liza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liza is known as the responsible mother of five children.
