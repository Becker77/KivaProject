For that reason, years after regaining her health, she started a service that allowed her to continue generating income and at the same time attend to her children. \r\n\r\nThis was how she ended up investing a small amount of capital in sweet tropical fruits, to be sold from her own home, little by little adding corn chicha beverages, snacks, tropical frozen sodas and cookies made by herself and her mother, which she prepares from a base of unrefined whole cane sugar.\r\n\r\nShe makes her sales in cash and her market is her neighbors. Previously, she had received a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she bought a freezer for the storage of frozen goods such as ice and ice cream products. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy snacks, chocolates, ice cream products and chicha in larger volumes in order to strengthen her sales and raise her working capital. Her goal, then, is to achieve an increase in her profits and in the future, adapt the space where she has her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1180971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks, chocolates, ice cream treats and chicha","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-10T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-10T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1080000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69786},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80654},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82536},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84462},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88450},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90513},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92625},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94787},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96998},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99262},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113494}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.77,"local_amount":69786,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70367.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387491},{"amount":44.81,"local_amount":80654,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":81326.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994321},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":82536,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":83223.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130673},{"amount":46.92,"local_amount":84462,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85165.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519531},{"amount":48.02,"local_amount":86433,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87153.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071373},{"amount":49.14,"local_amount":88450,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":89187.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497593},{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":90513,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":91267.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527405},{"amount":51.46,"local_amount":92625,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":93396.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928173},{"amount":52.65,"local_amount":94787,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":95576.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705344},{"amount":172.09,"local_amount":309754,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":312335.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967642}],"funded_date":"2012-09-24T22:48:00Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":469673,"name":"Diaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Diaa is from Iraq.

She is single and has one child. For the past seven years, Allen has been working hard to manage her restaurant which sells posho, matoke and other local foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Allen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a refrigerator so that she can sell chilled drinks, and it will help Allen to generate greater profits and pay for basic needs for her daughter because it is difficult to do as a single mom. Allen hopes that in the future she will be able to pay for school fees for her daughter and grow her restaurant. \r\n\r\nAllen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Looking to generate another job, Claudia seeks a loan to buy a tabletop sewing machine and supplies like cloth and thread in order to provide the working tools for the new job that she will create in her workshop.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to continue moving forward with this business and to continue making progress together with her husband and two children, offering them a better quality of life and greater economic opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1182706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

They survive on the earnings of the head of the family, Edwin, who offers transport services, using his own vehicle, as a taxi driver. Since his daughters are in secondary school, the costs continue to increase and the income of a taxi driver is insufficient, at times. They have to refrain from buying some things and postpone paying for other expenses.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Edwin's taxi is damaged and since it is his only source of income, this affects his ability to sustain his family. In order to be able to do so, he needs to repair his vehicle, so that he can improve his family's quality of

On occasion he was a day laborer with others and on occasion he worked on family farms.  Gelasio became independent from his family when he married Julia with whom he has a son to whom he has also instilled the love of work in the fields since in the community where they live they can\u2019t rely on many employment options.  \r\n\r\nPart of Gelasio\u2019s coffee production is conventional coffee and part is organic coffee.  He is doing the necessary work to convert all of the coffee production to organic coffee and is being advised by the staff of the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d with the purpose of obtaining better results.  For the next harvest he needs to buy organic fertilizer for his farms and he also wants to process his own coffee since in this way he can sell it at a better price.  In order to carry out this work he is applying for a loan which he will pay back at the end of the harvest.  \r\n\r\nApart from harvesting coffee, Gelasio also produces beans and bananas in order to have extra income for his family.  One of the things that Gelasio would like to achieve from the coffee harvest is to paint his house in order to give it a better image."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1182729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer and to process his own coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gelasio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":912,"local_amount":11831.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":12044.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936724},{"amount":13,"local_amount":168.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":171.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810665}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T01:14:35Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":467481,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to renew his coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9244.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810668}],"funded_date":"2012-09-11T22:01:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":469758,"name":"Pramila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pramila is a 48-year-old widow lady living with her daughter, age 19, and son, age 16.

order to support her three children. Two of her children are students and one is helping the family's business. She has been engaged in this business for seven years. For this business, the dropping price in the market is the key challenge for her as it affects her income. \r\n\r\nSokhei has been with Kiva's partner VisionFund for five loans. After each loan has been repaid, she feels empowered to upgrade her living conditions better than before. Now, she forms a group of two to apply for a new loan. The other member is a first-time borrower and seeks a loan of 1,000,000 KHR.

From a very young age he has worked buying and selling livestock, but for the past 14 years he has also worked in agriculture with the help of his father. He then moved on to working with his son, growing 4,900 square meters of corn. Sadly, his son passed away, and Daniel now grows 7,000 square meters of corn by himself.\r\n\r\nDaniel gets his agricultural inputs in a city located four kilometers from his home. To get there, he has to pay for a vehicle to travel back home. Once he gets home with his purchase, he has to pay for a cart pulled by oxen to take the inputs to the area where his crops are grown, which is located two kilometers away.\r\n\r\nThe loan Daniel has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy fertilizers and manure and to pay labor expenses. He will do this in order to improve his corn-growing business and his family\u2019s quality of life, and he hopes that his other children can finish their university education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1183337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and manure and to pay labor expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525246}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T11:52:18Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":469793,"name":"La's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"La is 39 years old and single.

They have five children, some of whom are in school and two of whom are still in the couple\u2019s care. Madeleine and her husband live together with their children and jointly provide for various household needs. Madeleine did not attend school. For almost 10 years, Madeleine has been selling food (rice and cornmeal mash) in a neighborhood of Benin. Madeleine enjoys her work that allows her to support herself and her children.

For the future, she hopes to gather more funds to buy new land and increase her crops but for now she\u2019ll be grafting the cocoa beans.\r\n\r\nThis is her 16th MFP loan and she recognizes that she has the obligation to make all her payments punctually and is determined to do so.  She\u2019s aware of all the agreements made by her communal bank because she\u2019s a very participative member.  She will use the 1000 new soles to buy cocoa bean plant grafts to grow on her land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1183503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa plant grafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-11T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-11T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1045,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529079}],"funded_date":"2012-09-11T21:45:12Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":470025,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alicia is a 55-year-old resident of Barangay III, Tangub City in the Philippines.

Over the last few years the private sector has taken advantage of this growth to expand its investment in development of shopping centers, residencial complexes, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this growth center is where Nancy lives.  She only received an elementary education because of the economic difficulties in her family, but thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit, which she inherited from her mother, she set up her own fast food business five years ago where she spends six hours a day, Monday through Friday, and 12 hours on weekends.  For Nancy, the loan she received through Fundacion Alternativa, financed by Kiva, helped her acquire the products she needed to add value to her business, which have increased her income so she can give her children the education she was unable to

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'The loan should be used in income generating activities or projects.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Margaret replied 'Income from the cow will help in paying school fees and in expanding farming projects.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Margaret owns the following: 'poultry, a bicycle' but does not own 'a cow, a pig, a pump, a motorcycle, or an automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'a mosquito net' but does NOT have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

central Rift Valley. For the past five years, she has been a farmer and her primary products are milk and crops. Catherine finds horticultural farming and growing French beans especially enjoyable. Her business challenges include the lack of irrigation equipment. Her cow, which is her farm animal, is named Meni, which is a name given to a cow with a black spot on its body\r\n\r\nCatherine is requesting a loan to to diversify her farming business by buying poultry and fertilizer. She chose Juhudi Kilimo for her loan because it is offering loans for farming. Catherine attended a required micro-finance training session and learned that it is easier to access a loan from micro-finance institutions compared to other financiers like banks. Her largest monthly expense is school fees. Catherine believes that her loan will increase her French bean and tomato crop which will help her to pay school fees and provide for her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Catherine owns a cow, poultry, and a bicycle, but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a household mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1190381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
