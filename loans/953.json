He is typically a farmer and grows tomatoes, beans and bananas.\n\nHe wants UGX 3,000,000 to pay school fees for his children who are going for their third term. The season has been slow and he may, therefore, not get enough funds at once to pay his children's fees. This is the reason he is opting for a loan. He will also use part of the loan to buy seedlings. He resorted to farming because it was easy and accessible since he had land.

For the past four years Prossy has worked hard in her maize fields to make a living. \r\n<p>\r\nProssy has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy fertilizer for her crops and so help her to generate greater profits. With these she will pay school fees and cover her family\u2019s basic needs. Prossy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy pigs to raise and sell. \r\n<p>\r\nProssy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started with growing only a few vegetables like potatos, tomatoes and onions, but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumber, lady finger and<i> brinjal<\/i> (eggplant). She has a very good relationship with her customers, as she sells fresh vegetables to her customers.

They stay at home organizing suitcases which they use to take the clothing out to sell, and come home between midday and 1:30 to prepare the lunch for their children. Then, during the evening, they go to church. They buy the products they need for their business in a city. To get there, they need to walk for about 15 minutes, and then take a bus for 30 minutes before arriving at their destination.\r\n\r\nMiguel plans to use his loan to buy two dozen skirts, blouses, bras, women\u2019s underwear, socks, men\u2019s underwear and boxer shorts, handkerchiefs, etc. He plans to use this money to meet the need for better items, as his customers request things which they cannot supply due to a lack of money. They also go to buy items every eight days, and with the loan they will be able to buy for the whole month, so that they can buy at better prices and with more variety. Miguel and his wife do all they can to give their children a better quality of life, and their goal is to ensure that they finish university, but Miguel has not been able to do this yet due to a lack of resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1180820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy two dozen skirts, blouses, bras, women\u2019s underwear, socks, men\u2019s underwear and boxer shorts, handkerchiefs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-12T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-12T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Ram\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.02,"local_amount":106.02,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383067},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":55.47,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":55.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990148},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":57.21,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":57.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970460},{"amount":58.56,"local_amount":58.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517184},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":58.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":58.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069026},{"amount":61.34,"local_amount":61.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":61.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495294},{"amount":303.19,"local_amount":303.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":303.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525242}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T06:25:34Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":470796,"name":"Twige Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Henriette fait partie du groupe Twige et  habite \u00e0 Cibitoke.

Es agricultor desde su ni\u00f1ez, disfruta de lo que hace, tiene mucha experiencia produciendo 30 sacos de ma\u00edz por 7,000 metros cuadrados de cultivo siendo su limitante los recursos econ\u00f3micos para ampliar su producci\u00f3n.\n\nCompra los insumos agr\u00edcolas en una ciudad que esta muy lejos de donde \u00e9l reside, para desplazarse le es dif\u00edcil ya que donde vive carece de transporte; lo m\u00e1s com\u00fan es trasladarse a caballo, siendo esa la raz\u00f3n por la cual se le dificulta trasladar los insumos.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar siete sacos de fertilizantes, dos galones de herbicidas, semillas de fr\u00edjol para cultivar 7,000 metros cuadrados de fr\u00edjol. Con la inversi\u00f3n, manifiesta don Jos\u00e9 que comprara todos los insumos de una sola vez y pagara un vehiculo para trasladarlos evitando perder tiempo y dinero. Al mismo tiempo, garantizara que sus cultivos tengan los fertilizantes en el momento oportuno; a fin de obtener una mejor producci\u00f3n e ingresos con los que espera proporcionar a su familia lo mas necesario como lo es la salud y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. \n\nDon Jos\u00e9 espera, que el cr\u00e9dito sea una alternativa para realizar cosas, que con sus propios recursos se le dificulta como la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, mejorar la vivienda. Quiere darse a conocer en la Instituci\u00f3n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 31 years of age, married, and has two children. He is known to be a hard-working person, who has an entrepreneurial spirit and is highly dedicated to his family and their prosperity. He has worked as a farmer since his childhood, and enjoys what he does. He has a lot of experience, and harvests 30 sacks of beans per 7,000 square meters sown. His only limitation is the financial resources he lacks to expand his crop harvest.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 buys his agricultural supplies in a city which is very far from where he lives. It\u2019s difficult to travel there as there is no transportation where Jos\u00e9 lives. The most usual way is to go by horse, and this is why it is so difficult to transport the supplies.\r\n\r\nThe loan Jos\u00e9 has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will be used to buy seven sacks of fertilizers, two gallons of herbicide, and bean seeds to sow 7,000 square meters of beans. Jos\u00e9 says he will use this investment to buy all the supplies at once, and will also pay for a vehicle to transport them, thereby saving time and money. Likewise, he will ensure that his crops have the fertilizers at the right time, so that he can have a larger harvest and greater income, which he hopes will give his family what they need in terms of health and the education of his children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 hopes that this loan will offer an alternative to allow him to do things that aren\u2019t easy for him due to his limited resources, such as educating his children and making improvements to his home. He would like to become well known within the institution.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1185189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seven sacks of fertilizers, two gallons of herbicide, and bean seeds to sow 7,000 square meters of beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-12T14:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-12T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.15,"local_amount":45.15,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":45.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399985},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":41.06,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383077},{"amount":90.08,"local_amount":90.08,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":90.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970467},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":42.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":42.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517191},{"amount":105.82,"local_amount":105.82,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495300},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":46.43,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":46.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525250},{"amount":178.56,"local_amount":178.56,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":178.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133510}],"funded_date":"2012-09-30T05:27:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":470225,"name":"Sambath's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sambat is a 52-year-old farmer from a rural area of Kror Kor district, Pursat Province, Cambodia.

Her farming business enables her to earn around 27,000 KHR per day and save less than 9,000 KHR. Sokhoeurn has been with VisionFund for two cycles. She has completely paid back the first loan. The first loan that she requested helped her better her family\u2019s living conditions. Due to low corn yields, she is now leading a group of two to take out a new loan with VisionFund. She is going to spend her loan portion on plowing her corn field and buying corn seeds.

In spite of being young, she is a very kind, hard-working, and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to succeed.  Sadly, for various reasons, she separated from her life partner.  Ever since then she has been father and mother to her little one.  In her free time she likes to play sports.  Sometimes she makes the delicious duck with rice to share with her family.  Liliana was not able to study for a career in gastronomy as she so wanted to do.  However, she hopes to be able to do so very soon.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, and with support from her mother, Liliana started her small business of selling beauty products.  She devotes approximately 12 hours a day to her business.  During that time she is able to tend to a good number of customers.  Liliana believes that her business is going well because of the good products that she sells and the kind and respectful way that she treats her customers.\r\n\r\nLiliana is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help given to her she will be able to buy two display cases and merchandise like perfume and cosmetics, among others.  This way Liliana will have a better stocked and better equipped business.  She will be able to better display her products.  This way she hopes to be able to increase her sales and her income.  By doing so she hopes to be able to, little by little, save the money needed to expand her business and have her own place to make her sales.  \r\n\r\nIn the not so distant future she wishes to fulfill her big dream of having her own house.  She also dreams of seeing her young son become a professional and an honorable man.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1185192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

To provide for the daily basic needs of her family, she has been farming for four years, earning about 20,000 KHR per day. The lack of water is a big challenge for her farmland. Malat has been with Kiva partner VisionFund for four cycles. The previous loans have enabled her to improve her family\u2019s living conditions.

With the passing of time and working hard they\u2019ve been able to acquire more land to increase their assets and yield more coffee. During the harvest, Macario hires his three children, who are all married, so they can help him in the field with cutting the coffee plants, something that would be impossible for him to do by himself. Macario has land that has not yet been sown because he acquired it just a short time ago. He would like to clear it and buy plants so that in three years it will generate coffee and that way his income will increase. To be able to do this, he is requesting a loan that he\u2019ll pay back after his next coffee harvest, and with any money leftover, he plans to buy a truck so he can transport his own coffee and not have to hire someone to do it. Macario\u2019s personal goals include renovating his house and supporting his children so that they can start their own businesses and generate better income.

While on the job working for others, he realized the frequency that gutters and shutters had to be replaced due to the inclement weather conditions in South Florida.   This realization would guarantee any quality business in this arena a steady clientele. With the creation of Rain Shield Gutters, a company that specializes in the installation of gutters and shutters for private and commercial properties, Mario not only found a niche but also accomplished a dream.  \r\n\r\nMario wakes up every day with a smile on his face because he feels that his work is meaningful to communities in South Florida.

Most importantly, Mario puts his heart in every single job.\r\n\r\nMario has seen a significant growth in demand for his services in the past year.

While providing hair care, extensions and styling to women for so many years, she often found herself having to mix several products together in order to get the results she wanted for her clients; mostly women of color. In 2006, she began a creative quest of research; trial and testing in order finalize a product that could help women of color hair types. In 2009, she started Tress Labs Inc. in order to formalize her freelance hair styling as well as to be able to trademark Formula N Hair Care, a line of natural and organic topical hair treatments intended to strengthen, build elasticity and hydrate brittle, chemically processed and natural hair types. The very first hair treatments were released this spring including Formula N Drop N's and Formula N Oil Steam Treatment. See http:\/\/formulanhaircare.com\/\r\n\r\nAll other products are still in development but for now, she needs a loan from Accion to fund the completion of her website and to help her fulfill her first large order from Ana Hair Design Studio located in Upper Manhattan. She has received much interest from other stylists and would put part of the funds towards marketing and packaging. In addition to the freelance styling she does for private clients, she also is a stylist for BET, Black Entertainment Productions. Njeri is well connected in the world of black women's beauty and has the potential to take her business to the next level. Please help Njeri get her products off the ground and help her to market them on her website.  Njeri has big dreams. Help them become a reality.

She has five children, two of whom are dependent and still in school. To support the family, she has been in rice farming on five hectares of farmland for five years and complements the income by selling cakes while her husband works as a paid worker. Having been in this business for 10 years, she and her husband are able to earn about 27,000KHR and manage to save about 10,000KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses. Drought is the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nSe has been with VisionFund for one cycle while the other members are just with VisionFund this cycle as well.

She has 2 children and has been doing this work for 6 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops.\n\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'She loves Dairy keeping  because it's a sure business!' Her biggest challenge is 'Getting feeds can be a bit hectic.' The animal on the farm has been given the name of 'Lelgina.'\n\nSarah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'heard from other existing groups.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'She learnt about the various products in Juhudi also the importance of credit.'\n\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Sarah replied 'She has got an alternative source of income thus will be able to educate her children.'She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. From the following list of assets to choose from: Cow, Poultry, Pig, Bicycle, Motorcycle, Automobile, Tractor and Pump, Sarah owns the following: cow, poultry, pump.\n\nJuhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. For this the borrower is asked which of the following items are in the household: mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD. Sarah has mosquito net, tv.\n\nNote: By using mobile devices in the field to build this profile, Juhudi Kilimo is making its operations more efficient.

is 41 years old and married woman with two children. She is an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) and lives with her family in the IDP Settlement.  Nahida is a widow; she lost her husband during the war and raises her two children alone. She is a farmer raising seasonal fruits and vegetables. She has eight years of experience, which makes her an experienced and skilled person in this field. \r\n\r\nNahida usually sells her crops from her house. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made from vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch. Her monthly income is 70 AZN. Raising crops is taking a lot of strength.

Perfecta sells chicken, Raquel sells clothing, Maria Isabel sells cosmetics, Cipriana Gabriela sells food and provides a dressmaking service, Angela sells footwear, and Celsa and Jose Luis sell underwear.  The group is located in a region where people grow sugarcane.\r\n\r\nPerfecta tells us that her parents only sent her to school up to high school level and then taught her to work so that she could earn a living and provide for herself.  She is the single mother of two children and has had to work hard as a saleswoman in order to provide for them.  She currently sells chicken (in pieces) and cheese.  She places her scales and her products on a table in front of her house.  As she has been selling for a number of years, she doesn't have to go out to make her sales as her customers come to her.  She also tells us that in her free time she weaves bags and blouses which she then sells to make a little extra money.  What Perfecta likes most about her business is that she can take care of it without neglecting her children.  At the same time, she is able to teach her children to work as they sometimes help her to serve her customers.  Perfecta will invest this loan in buying chickens and cheese so that she can continue making her sales.  In the future, she would like to continue building her house and ensure her children further their studies.\r\n\r\nThis group is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they are

Maria, 33, lives with her husband.  They have three children, 12-, 7- and 3-years old, respectively.  The two oldest children are now in school.  Her husband drives a taxi for a living.  \r\n \r\nSra. Maria operates a clothing and cosmetics sales business to help her husband with household expenses and runs the family home.  She stocks her business with products--clothing, Avon and Yanbal cosmetics--that she orders from catalogs and sells them from door to door.  She works two or three hours a day, three days a week.  She works in the mornings mostly because that's when her two oldest children are in school.  She takes her youngest child along on her calls because she doesn't have anyone to leave him (or her) with, but she's never given up.  She sells on credit and collects from her customers every eight days.  She has operated the business for a year and says that she is happy with her progress.\r\n\r\nSra. Maria is applying for a new loan because the last one, she says, was very helpful to her business.  She adds that her business earnings covered the costs of much needed medical care for one of her children and that he (or she) is much better now.  She will use this loan to stock her retail business with clothing, cosmetics, etc.  She started the community bank and says that loans have been very important for her business.\r\n \r\nFor the future, she wants to open her own store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1177833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock her retail business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":116.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150628},{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383730},{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990733},{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127108},{"amount":350.01,"local_amount":350.01,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":350.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517629},{"amount":116.63,"local_amount":116.63,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":116.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069489}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T08:45:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":468537,"name":"Familia Toribio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cFamilia Toribio\u201d se encuentra ubicado en una comunidad muy tranquila donde la gente es muy mable y sociable por lo regular siempre est\u00e1n muy alegres.

The three members of the group all belong to one family and they have never worked with a microfinance group before. As a result they were a little nervous after having signed their contract, but they are sure that nothing bad will come of it. \r\n\r\n27-year old Magaly is the group\u2019s representative. She is a single mother of a daughter aged 1 year and 6 months who does not yet attend school although she is already excited about the prospect. Magaly runs a small grocery store where she sells goods that are most in demand. \u201cI used to work in Mexico City,\u201d she says, \u201c but I didn\u2019t like being so far from my daughter so I started the business so I could spend with more time with her.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe decided to open the store four months ago and she likes seeing how it\u2019s slowly grown. She doesn\u2019t like having to say to her customers that she doesn\u2019t have what they are looking for so she is seeking a loan to buy more products such as bread, milk, soft drinks, eggs, water and sugar. One problem she has at the moment is a neighbour who has run the same kind of store for many years and has many customers.

India formed a group named 'Radha Krushna' (named after the Hindu God lord Krishna and His power Radha whom they believe to be their protector) to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business. Basumati is one of these women. The lady standing on the extreme left in the photo raising her hand is Basumati, aged 26, a very poor tribal lady who lives with her husband and her daughter aged 2. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. The present house where her family is residing has been allotted to her father-in-law under Indira Awas Yojana of govt. of India. (A housing scheme for landless families)\r\n\r\n Basumati has been running a general store in the local market of her small village for the last 8 years. Her husband supplements her in her business. She sells general grocery items like rice, oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks (sodas) and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Basumati was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.5000\/-. \r\n\r\nOut of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and she spent some income on house repair. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase the stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store.This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. \r\n\r\nBasumati hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested.

They greet each other in Mazahua, the local language.\r\n\r\nDon Eusebio, 64, and his wife, Felipa, have been married for many years.  They have four children, all grown now, with families of their own.  Don Eusebio is a hard-working man and has operated his business for many years.  He doesn't remember exactly when he started the business, but says that it must have been sometime in the 1970s.  He sells socks, underwear and other clothing pieces.  When we asked him how he started the business, he said, \"I had space in one of the large markets in town and had to fill it with something so I started my business there . . . I will use this loan to stock the business\".  Don Eusebio says that he is grateful to the VisionFund for past loans because they have helped him to grow his business.\r\n\r\nDon Eusebio works almost every day, only taking Thursdays off.  He likes the work and jokes, \"My customers like to gossip about local goings-on and I know they'll come back to pick up where they left off\".  He adds, too, that he, \"can spend more time with his wife because she helps me with the business\".  Don Eusebio will use this loan to stock his business for the busy season ahead.  He tries, he says, to keep the business fully-stocked so that he won't lose customers.  When we asked him about his goals for the future, he told us, \"At my age, I don't have any grand plans, but I would like to carry on the business so that my wife and I won't have to worry about supporting ourselves in the future\".  Don Eusebio is grateful for our help because we have always supported his efforts to grow his business and improve his quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1185302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock his retail business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2920.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3099.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3231.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3415.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3574.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3759.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":222.65,"local_amount":2920.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2939.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407692},{"amount":236.33,"local_amount":3099.38,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3119.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392124},{"amount":246.37,"local_amount":3231.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3252.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068037},{"amount":187.79,"local_amount":2462.88,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284790},{"amount":631.86,"local_amount":8286.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8340.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199117}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T00:20:46Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":470713,"name":"Ma.

Her mother says that she takes after her father.  Diana, 28, tells us that she and her husband, Ruben, have three school-aged children.  She operates a business milling nixtamal.  (Nixtamal is a cooked maize preparation that provides the base for tortillas.)  She says, \"I got the idea for the business when my husband's cousin was laid off from the nixtamal mill where he used to work . . . I decided to put up the money so that we could start our own mill\".  The business is seven-years old now.  Diana says that she likes the business and has learned a lot about it over the years.  She never imagined that it would be so successful, but she's very happy that it is.  She travels out to sell product from the mill but many come to her because her customers have referred them to her.  For the future, Diana wants her children to study for professional careers.  She says that her children are very smart and she is sure they will do very well if they have the chance to continue studying.

He is married to Sra. Marcelina, a housewife.  Don Jes\u00fas never had a chance to go to school because he had to go to work when he was very young.  He worked at an electricals repair shop in a small city for a few years and when we asked him how he picked up the skills for it, he laughed loudly and said, \"Well . . . the owner was my teacher, but he's 6 feet under now\".  He started his own auto repair business 23 years ago, he says and adds, \"What I most like about my business is fixing cars and knowing that my customers will be happy with my work and come back if and when they need additional work\".  Don Jes\u00fas is applying for a loan to buy the spare parts he needs to operate his business.  He usually receives supplies of spare parts 15 days after he submits orders for them.  He hasn't been able to grow the business in the way that he'd like because his supplies are expensive and long lead times are often a problem.  For the future, he wants to expand and improve his shop so that he can provide an even better service.  Don Jes\u00fas wants you to know that he, \"is very grateful to KIVA lenders and VisionFund for supporting small businesses over the years and helping me and others to help ourselves\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1031196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to fund his vehicle repair business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1463.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1497.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1532.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1568.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1604.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1642.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1680.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1719.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1760.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1801.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1843.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1886.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225.78,"local_amount":2961.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407694},{"amount":236.44,"local_amount":3100.84,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3121.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392126},{"amount":375.75,"local_amount":4927.92,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119989},{"amount":265.34,"local_amount":3479.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3502.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068038},{"amount":277.87,"local_amount":3644.18,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3667.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284791},{"amount":143.82,"local_amount":1886.12,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1898.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199118}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T16:03:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":470723,"name":"Ludivina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ludivina, 49 years old, is married and lives in the Philippines.

and energetic women from Duajhar village, Khariar Block of Nuapada district in Odisha, India. This group was started in 2010 with the purpose of raising the income level of the families. \r\n\r\nThe featured member, Bhumisuta, is one of them. The lady standing to the far right and raising her hand in the photo is Bhumisuta. She is 37 years old, and lives with her husband, two sons, aged 17 and 15, and mother in-law. Her sons are attending college. For the last ten years, Bhumisuta has maintained her family by running a small business making and selling sweets with the help of her husband. She specially makes a locally popular sweet named \u201cKhurma\u201d (fried dough dipped in sugar syrup). Her husband uses his moped every day to supply the product to wholesalers in the local market as per their orders. Bhumisuta also supplies sweets for functions in their village as per the order of the customer. \r\n\r\nBhumisuta and her husband cook for six hours in an open fire every day, making 50\u201360 kg of sweets with a daily expenditure of 2,500 INR. Bhumisuta needs to replenish her stock of raw materials such as dough, oil, sugar, and firewood once a week. She says that the prices of raw materials are changing very frequently and that she has been a victim of the price rise many times due to her frequent replenishment cycle. To safeguard herself from price fluctuation, Bhumisuta will use the loan amount to buy raw materials such as oil, dough etc. in bulk and then store them. This will  help her to save the repeated transportation and purchasing costs. Bhumisuta dreams of buying a four-wheeler in the near future to make the transporting and supply of her manufactured products very smooth with low transportation costs. So she and her husband are working very hard to save money to help their cherished dream materialize.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rohini, Malati, and Droupadi who run clothes and grocery shop businesses to help support their families.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1190803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing of oil,dough etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rohini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Droupadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T03:56:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":470745,"name":"Adela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adela is  43 years old, married and lives in the Philippines.

The five group members are all weavers who inherited the weaving skill from their mothers in their teenage years. \r\n\r\nPi Hoikholhing spends three to four hours daily in weaving while the children are in school and at night when the children sleep. As she is weaving the traditional way, she is able to finish only three shawls weekly from the traditional \u2018Loin\u2019 as seen in the photograph. \r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Pi Hoikholhing wants to buy a Loom, which is a quicker and faster weaving machine. Pi Hoikholhing believes that, with the additional income she earns by weaving more shawls with the Loom, she will help ease the family burden considerably.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a hand loom weaving machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglienmawi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-13T17:48:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":470748,"name":"Masika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Masika is grateful for a previous loan she received because it allowed her to buy more charcoal to sell to her customers.

Gracias\u201d  ","en":"We went to visit Maria and she told us that the investment of her Kiva loan in her business steadied her tamale production, and with it she was able to increase her sales and likewise increase the number of customers. She brought her family together and with her profits she was able to make repairs to her home, since it didn't have concrete floors. She built walls and a roof, which in the future will serve as a base to make a second floor.\r\n\r\nOnce these adaptations had been made, she could have her business in her own home and she stopped paying rent and this makes her feel very happy. Her current sales average 150 to 200 tamales. Her customers ask for more every day and she has a sales potential which she would like to approach, but her working capital does not yet permit it. For this reason she is thinking that with a new Kiva loan she will do it little by little. She says it will be new aid, to continue with the expansion of her business in the marketplace and to help with the fulfillment of her customers' orders which have not yet gotten her response.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan she will buy supplies and raw materials wholesale. She wants to achieve her goal of business growth, which she dreams of. Her message to those who provide financing through Kiva is this: \"I want to thank you for the vote of confidence, your support, and the help in fulfilling my dream of working as an independent person. In this moment you are participants in this dream and with your help I will have the opportunity to go forward and become a great producer of tamales. Thank you, through this noble work I have brought my family forward, offering them a better quality of Life.

Since then she has been working hard to support her children. \n\nShe started the business of selling fresh fish and dried fish. Drying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use by drying them in the sun until the water is completely evaporated. Dried fish has a storage life of several years. Dried fish is used in different delicacies as fresh fish is and is very popular in the region.\n\nShe buys fish directly from the local fishermen and sells some of them fresh and dries some of them to sell as dried fish. She purchases 10 to 12 kg of fresh fish and 18-20 kg of dried fish and sells it by roaming door to door in the nearby villages. She earns 4,000 INR per month.\n \nShe has applied for a loan of 20,000 INR so that she can purchase the fish in a bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season. There is a huge demand for dried fish during the monsoon season as not much stock is available in the market. So she can get a better price as well. \n\nThis loan will help her to increase her working capital to run her business by increasing her revenues almost 50%, giving her 5,000 to 6,000 INR per month.\nShe wants to save enough to give her children a good quality of life and send them to college. She wants to see them educated and not working as fishermen.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1187948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish in bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season for her fish business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanakalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T03:20:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":470105,"name":"Ann Sara Akasha Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group Ann Sara Akasha Self Help Group (SHG) has 10 members who are all from the same neighborhood.
