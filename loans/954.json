She lives in a village close to the beautiful Chilika Lake, one of the biggest lakes in Odisha.\n\nKanakalata got married to Madhu when she was 20 years old. Like other village folk, her husband was a fisherman who went to Chilika for fishing. Unfortunately, she lost her husband in 2009 in an accident when he went fishing. Since then she has been working hard to support her children. \n\nShe started the business of selling fresh fish and dried fish. Drying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use by drying them in the sun until the water is completely evaporated. Dried fish has a storage life of several years. Dried fish is used in different delicacies as fresh fish is and is very popular in the region.\n\nShe buys fish directly from the local fishermen and sells some of them fresh and dries some of them to sell as dried fish. She purchases 10 to 12 kg of fresh fish and 18-20 kg of dried fish and sells it by roaming door to door in the nearby villages. She earns 4,000 INR per month.\n \nShe has applied for a loan of 20,000 INR so that she can purchase the fish in a bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season. There is a huge demand for dried fish during the monsoon season as not much stock is available in the market. So she can get a better price as well. \n\nThis loan will help her to increase her working capital to run her business by increasing her revenues almost 50%, giving her 5,000 to 6,000 INR per month.\nShe wants to save enough to give her children a good quality of life and send them to college. She wants to see them educated and not working as fishermen.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1187948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish in bulk to make more dried fish and stock up during the monsoon season for her fish business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanakalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T03:20:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":470105,"name":"Ann Sara Akasha Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group Ann Sara Akasha Self Help Group (SHG) has 10 members who are all from the same neighborhood.

The group is located in the community of San Agustin, an area  in which many residents work in the rubber industry extracting pitch and rubber resin from trees. The other major industry in the region is the cultivation of sugar cane.\r\n\r\nAmelia is 23 years old, and studied two years at a university. She is a single mother with a young son, and just over a year ago, she opened up an internet caf\u00e9 in a small space in the front of her home. She comments that, \u201cI thank God that business is going well, and since I am located just across the street from the school, many customers visit my caf\u00e9.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmelia offers several services to her customers, including computer access, document scanning and printing. She believes that things are going well because she is very attentive to customer needs and will even help customers learn how to use computers free of charge. She plans to use the support from this loan to repair and service some of her computers, as well as to purchase ink cartridges and reams of copy paper to restock the business. Amelia hopes that this investment will help to grow and strengthen her business, leading to an improved quality of life for her and a better future for her son. She also would like to begin selling USB flash drives at her business.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\nMargarita, whop operates a general store.\r\nArmando, who sells hot dogs.\r\nImelda, who sells traditional Mexican food.\r\nMaria del Carmen, who sells perfume.\r\nLeonor, who sells traditional Mexican food.\r\nEvelia, who sells shoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1185482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"repair and service her computers, as well as purchase ink cartridges, reams of paper and other supplies for her internet cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin, Tezonapa, Ver.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6765.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407699},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6765.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392132},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6765.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119995},{"amount":146.35,"local_amount":1927.52,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1931.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068044},{"amount":366.15,"local_amount":4822.48,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4833.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698714}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T16:31:42Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":468350,"name":"Belinda Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Belinda tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y vive con sus padres y hermano menor en el municipio de Tela, Atl\u00e1ntida.\nBelinda es una persona muy emprendedora, se dedica a su propio negocio desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, vende ropa nueva y usada para damas, jeans, blusas, camisetas, short y otros como perfumes y accesorios.

They are from Duajhar village under Nuapada district in Odisha, India and started a new venture to contribute to their family income by forming a group in the year 2012. The featured member, Kamala, is sitting in the middle raising her hand in the photo. She is 42 years old and lives with her husband, one son age 16 and one daughter age 13. Kamala is a very energetic and hard working lady. She has been running a cloth weaving unit in her house for the last 25 years. Now she is managing her business successfully with three weaving units. In two units, she is weaving saris and in one unit gamchha (towels). Kamala has engaged three skilled laborers to help her with the weaving. They produce three saris and three towels per day. Kamala pays Rs 100\/- per sari and Rs 50\/- per towel as labor charges to the weavers. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread per unit costs around 10,000\/-) from a stockist in a nearby town on credit and gives the finished products to the same stockiest who does not give as much return to her compared to her efforts. Therefore,  she is running at a continuous loss and facing a lot of trouble maintaining her family.  So she is planning to use the entire loan to purchase more stock of raw materials like yarn. This will help her to eliminate some unnecessary expenses resulting from frequent movements to bring in raw materials. The role of Kamala in the business is to process the thread. Sometimes her daughter also helps her in this processing work. Kamala hopes to repair her house and wants to purchase some assets for the marriage of her daughter. \r\n\r\nIndra, Sasidei, Rukmani and Sasi are the other four members. They are running a medicine store, a cloth business, a utensils business and atailoring business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase yarn\/thread for weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T05:24:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":468578,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA SE\u00d1ORA ELISA TIENE 36 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD Y TIENE TRES HIJOS EN EDAD ESCOLAR, ESTUDI\u00d3 S\u00d3LO LA PRIMARIA.

cerca a la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias. Su vida transcurre entre su trabajo en su tienda  y su familia conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y su hijo de 6 a\u00f1os de edad. Deyanira desde hace 2 a\u00f1os se dedic\u00f3 a la actividad comercial,  vendiendo mercanc\u00edas mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos,  como ropa, calzado y cosm\u00e9ticos, actividad con la que le fue muy bien y logr\u00f3 agregar ingresos a su hogar, adem\u00e1s de ense\u00f1arle su oficio de comerciante. Cuando se mud\u00f3 cerca a la carretera troncal en su pueblo, percibi\u00f3 el peligro que corr\u00edan los habitantes del pueblo al cruzar esa v\u00eda, al comprar  diariamente sus v\u00edveres y los art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar que en su familia consumen. Este hecho le dio la idea de adicionar a sus ingresos un nuevo negocio,  que fue el montaje de su propia tienda para venderles tambi\u00e9n, art\u00edculos que sus vecinos requer\u00edan, como lo que hoy hace al comercializar productos de primera necesidad, ranchos, v\u00edveres, refrescos, l\u00e1cteos etc., ropa  y calzado. Con su negocio ha visto el progreso desde su propia casa al generar ingresos; su proyecto futuro es hacer crecer  su tienda para aumentar los ingresos de su familia. Deyanira realiza sus  ventas diariamente y de contado principalmente, mientras sus compras las realiza una parte a cr\u00e9dito y otra parte  de contado.  Ella tiene un gran desaf\u00edo que superar y es el de no tener, muchas veces,  los productos que sus clientes necesitan, por eso se ha acercado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para aplicar a su primer credikiva con el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres que rotan f\u00e1cilmente como arroz, az\u00facar, aceite, l\u00e1cteos, enlatados y refrescos.   Con esta inversi\u00f3n proyecta mejorar sus ventas con m\u00e1s art\u00edculos y aumentar el n\u00famero de sus clientes fijos. Su meta es mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales y terminar sus estudios, lo cual le significa tambi\u00e9n un gran desaf\u00edo personal. ","en":"Deyanira, 31, lives in the artisanal community of Costa Caribe very near the city of Cartagena de Indias.  Her life unfolds between her store and her family composed of her spouse and six-year-old son.  Deyanira has been a merchant for two years;  she started selling merchandise like clothes, shoes and cosmetics via specialized catalogues .  She did very well with this activity and was able to contribute income to her home in addition to learning how to be a merchant.\r\n\r\nWhen she relocated near her town\u2019s main highway she realized that residents in the town exposed themselves to danger crossing that highway to buy basic staple items their families consume every day.    This gave her an idea for a way to increase her income with a new business which was to open a store of her own to sell products to her neighbors that they needed and has been doing so to date; she sells basic staple items, snacks, foodstuffs, soft-drinks, dairy products, clothes and footwear, etc.  With her business she\u2019s seen her home improve as she\u2019s generated income.  Her future project is to make the store bigger thus increasing family income even more.  \r\n\r\nDeyanira sells every day and mostly for cash while her purchases are partly on credit and partly cash.  She has a great challenge to overcome which is that often she does not have everything her customers need in stock which is why she\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for her first KIVA loan to buy the items that sell the most like rice, sugar, oil, dairy products, canned goods and soft-drinks.  With this investment, she\u2019s anticipating improved sales with more merchandise and an increase in the number of her regular customers.

The featured member of this group is Tilottama, sitting second from the left and raising her hand in the photo. She is 35 years old, living with her husband and three daughters. She is a very active lady of BPL (below poverty line) category. For the last 10 years, she has been running a tent house (giving bowl, tent, cloth boundary wall, chairs, light, sound system etc. rented for social functions) with the help of her husband. She initially started the business with limited items like bowls, chairs, tarpaulin etc. As she owned a small house, she stored some items for the tent house in her house and some items in a rented house.  At that time, she was earning a monthly income of Rs 4,000 per month. With her limited earnings, it was very difficult on her part to manage her household expenses. With the present loan, Tilottama has decided to purchase a sound system, some more chairs, bowls, drums, mats, pillows etc.to rent, taking into consideration the present demand. This will help her to generate extra income to meet her immediate requirements like providing a better education for her children in the nearby advanced school. She has a long-term vision to construct a go-down (warehouse) of her own to keep the tent house materials safely as at present she is keeping the materials in a rented go-down (warehouse). The other three members of the group are Kumudini, Laxmi and Bisaya who sell betel nuts, run a grocery shop and run a tiffin (light meal) restaurant.

She earns a monthly remuneration of Rs 1,000\/-. In comparison to the family needs, the income from the above sources is not sufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family. So, looking at market demand and their traditional occupation (raising cows), in the year 2010 Jamuna purchased a cow and started a milk business. Presently, she is getting 6 liters of milk per day from a single cow and supplying it to a tea stall in a nearby town @ 16\/-. This additional income helps her to a great extent in maintaining the educational expenses of her two sons. Looking at her success in the milk business. Jamuna has planned to invest a portion of her loan to buy another cow of the jersey variety and the rest to repair her cow shed to get more output. Jamuna dreams of developing a dairy farm in the future and supplying milk to the milk processing plant. The other three members of her group (Nalini, Jugalmati and Kshame) are also running similar businesses . \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a cow and repair the cow shed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Thakpali,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T20:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T20:40:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nalini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jugalmati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshame","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":116000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T08:35:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":470780,"name":"Philimon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philimon farms in his local home area in Nyamira, Kenya; poultry is his main produce for the local market.

","en":"28 year-old Karine started her own business in 2010. With two years of legal experience, she rented some space and opened her own small law office. Karine works on relatively small cases, but hopes that the experience she gains will enable her to expand her business in the future. Karine doesn't take days off and works late into the evening.

years old.  He is a conscientious and hardworking man, who is married and raising an adolescent son.  His father works as a driver and is also simultaneously involved in animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops with Davron.  Davron has plenty of experience in animal husbandry and farming.  He primarily grows wheat, barley and potatoes.  He uses a portion of the harvest as a feed for livestock and sells the remainder to the local residents.  A large number of this village population buy wheat and then obtain flour at a mill and bake bread for personal consumption, and use the waste from the wheat to feed livestock.  According to Davron's words, he has good conditions for animal husbandry, but does not have enough financial means to purchase livestock.  He wants to use the resulting income to improve his household conditions.  He is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 somoni to buy five cows.  He awaits your

She learned this skill from her mother, who always accompanied her. Today, she sells clothing and shoes, especially for the beach since she lives in a tourist city near the Caribbean Sea. This type of clothing is needed here due to the atmosphere of the beach, the breeze, and the sea by this historic, fortified city.\r\n\r\nAmelia is currently separated and is a mother of two children ages 5 and 7. She works hard because she dreams of seeing her children as successful professionals. They are her motivation to work hard as a merchant.\r\n\r\nAmelia sells sweaters, blouses, shorts, shoes and other items to new and regular customers who request this merchandise, which she buys in the city of Barranquilla when she recoups her working capital. The majority of this capital comes from her accounts receivable. Her main customers are found on the beaches of Cartagena and Barranquilla, and they are mainly tourists looking for the clothing options that Amelia offers. She sells from 8am until 5pm and her purchases are made weekly in cash at places that have constant promotions and sales that are convenient for her, and especially for her customers. In the future, her goal is to have her own home by working a lot and saving for this accomplishment.

She is resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is married to Roberto, self-employed and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarcelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 32,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarcelina hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She is 40 years and lives with her husband, father in-law and mother in-law. Chanchala hails from a Below Poverty Line family. For the last 20 years, Chanchala has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. She has one weaving set. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread for weaving saris from a trader in a village 20 kms away. A bundle of thread produces 80-100 pieces of saris and costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Chanchala does the initial processing of the thread to make it ready for weaving. After that, her husband fits it to the weaving machine and starts the weaving work. Chanchala\u2019s husband works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves a single piece of sari.  On a weekly basis, Chanchala sells saris to the local traders in her village. She earns a monthly income of Rs 3, 000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. Chanchala wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk with the loan. Purchasing more stock at one time will help her to reduce the purchasing cost of the raw materials. Chanchala wants to increase her business and save enough to complete the construction of her house.\r\n\r\nUpama, Ujal and Bhanumati are the three other members of the group who are running a general grocery shop and a cloth weaving business, and getting support from their husbands for the over all development of their families. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Upama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ujal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhanumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T23:47:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":467679,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Magdalena, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

She is married to Ronnie and has a child. She and her husband manages their own household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNorma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNorma hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1183845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3527.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114633},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3528.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350679},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2821.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959787},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":705.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094500}],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T12:01:18Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:31:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyle Setzer","image":244339}},{"id":468865,"name":"Yaneth Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yaneth con su anterior credikiva compr\u00f3 insumos para prepara las comidas en su restaurante y gan\u00f3 descuentos por su compra de contado y en mayor volumen.

It is a group comprised of four women members of the village called Dumerbahal. It is located in the Nuapada district; one of the poorest districts of India. One of the members of this group is Dibyarani who has raised her hand in the photo. She is 26 years old and her family consists of her husband, one small daughter, father in-law and mother in-law. Dibyarani has been running a small bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband for the last 12 years. In the factory, bakery items like bread, cream roll and toast etc. are being prepared. She has engaged four skilled laborers for the processing and making of the bakery items. Her husband supplies the products to three or four nearby towns within a 40 km radius. Dibyarani says owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locals, but due to a shortage of stock she could not meet their demands. She does not like to say \u201cNo\u201d to her customers and wants to give better service to her customers. She now wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, etc. to increase her production level to meet the demands and grab her customers. A portion of the loan will be used to purchase raw materials in bulk, which will reduce her purchasing and transportation costs. As the present location of the factory is in her residence, Dibyarani wants to construct a separate house in a prominent place in her locality to run the business smoothly. She also hopes to save money from the sale proceeds for provide a better education facility to her only girl child.\r\n\r\nThe other three active members of the group are Nabina, who has a sweets-making business and grocery shop, Jajnaseni, who sells and supplies bakery items, and Rangalata who has a grocery business and hopes to provide better education to their children and increase their living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase oil, dough, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dumerbahal,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dibyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jajnaseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rangalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T14:42:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":471564,"name":"Orokia's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme OROKIA repr\u00e9sente le groupe DIOUGOU SOMPRIN.

Its five members are all women who belong to the Below Poverty Line category (BPL) from the village called Gadramunda.

The lady sitting in the middle raising her hand is Panchu. She is 29 years old; living with her husband, three sons aged 10, 8 & 5 years and one daughter who is 2 years old. She is a very active lady and fond of cooking. She has been running a snacks & sweets-making and supply business at her house with the help of her husband for a couple of years. She initially started with two varieties and slowly expanded to three different varieties. She, along with her husband, cook local salty snacks named 'Namkin' (locally popular food of triangular shape and salty in taste), \u201cGaja\u201d (fried dough dipped in sugar syrup) & Ladduu (one type of round shaped sweet) and make packages. Her husband travels to the surrounding villages selling to local shops there. He travels almost 40 km in a day. She and her husband spend almost four hours a day making snacks and packets and selling them.  In this process, her family earns a profit of rupees 200\/- to 250\/- daily. For raw materials like cooking oil, sugar and dough, her husband travels to the nearby town frequently every three days and spend more time and transportation cost. She now wants to have a stock of raw materials like cooking oil, sugar and dough, so that they have enough stock to carry on their business regularly with out any intervention. Panchu has planned to use a portion of the loan to buy the raw materials in bulk, saving the transportation cost and getting a cash discount. She hopes to complete her half-built house and start a screen printing business as her husband has sufficient experience in that field by using the rest of her loan. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Sasirekha, Jachana, Pana and Suraj and they have businesses like selling milk, running a grocery shop and cultivating vegetables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase dough, sugar, oil etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sasirekha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panchu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jachana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T08:11:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":470625,"name":"Maa Maheswari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The name of this group is Maa Maheswari (named after a village deity of the locality).

He does daily labor and earn a very small income. Saila runs a milk processing unit at her house. She has only one cow, which produces 8 to 10 liters of milk per day. As the milk is not sufficient, Saila and her husband go to three or four nearby villages and collect 200 liters of milk per day to process and produce milk products like Paneer, Chhena (cheese), butter, ghee, khua and Peda (a sweet item made of khua) and sell them to earn an income of Rs 400 to Rs 500 per day in the off season (August-October). In the peak season, i.e. in the marriage season, (November-July) they earn Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per day by selling the milk products. She employs a person to help her in the processing. She has a small freezer to keep the products and supply in the market but it is insufficient for her. With the loan, she is planning to purchase a deep freezer of 1500 kgs capacity to store the milk products for days together and sell them at peak time to earn more profit. In addition, she has a plan to construct a cement kiln for her processing unit. At present, she is educating her children in the nearby high school and college. As providing college education is very expensive,  she is trying to increase her income to meet the demands of her children.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Lida is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLida hopes to grow her business and dreams of creating a good future for her family through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance

Her business was born in the month of July of 2006 since she learned how to handle computer technology as a big hobby. Her father supported her interest, purchasing three computers for her to initiate an income-generating business. So began her road to success as she made a good profit which allowed her to add printing services for which she purchased a machine, as well as international calling, by which she went about establishing a customer base, taking the opportunity to add products for sale that might fit well with her business, such as the stationery items and frozen treats. \r\n\r\nHer main customers are students, neighbors and business employees who access the technological services and make purchases from morning until 9 at night. She exerts herself constantly to tend to her customers' every need because she wants to achieve the dream of laying the foundations so that when her children arrive to the home she shares with her husband, they would have everything ready to achieve their well-being. Currently she has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to access a Kiva loan with which she will purchase new computer equipment to replace that which has become obsolete. In this way she will provide greater speed for computer tasks which will attract ever more potential customers and build the loyalty of her regular customers, earning more and more money for her work. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1187220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase new computer equipment.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php40,000 loan.

His greatest challenge is the lack of tools and working capital to make this move, and this is why he has requested a Kiva loan. This is the first financing he has applied for from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and he will use it to buy a crane to lift engines, a metal spray gun and a compressor. Henry\u2019s goal is to have his own workshop in the future, and to improve his car repair and maintenance services.

He loves them dearly and cares for them in a house that he bought many years ago.  Celso has been a widower for four years and, over those years, he has had to work hard for his children, take care of them and take over their mother's role.  He says that it is a little difficult but he has managed to gain their confidence and they are very fond of him.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, Celso opened a workshop in his own home where he makes all kinds of bread-making machinery such as mixers, cutters, bread ovens, etc.  He has managed to gain good customers and perfect his construction abilities.  He has a lot of machines that help him in his work.  He has a lot of work in the month of December and so he hires staff during that month as he doesn't just make machines but also maintains, repairs and improves them.  He would like to improve his business and be able to hire a professional to replace him because he doesn't have the strength he once had.  However, as he is a responsible man, he says that he will always oversee the business that he loves so much.\r\n\r\nThis is Celso's third loan from MFP and he feels very happy that he is able to carry out his work as normal thanks to the support that you all give him.  He pledges to make his loan repayments on time as he has always been a hard-working, respectable person.  Celso will invest the money he has requested in buying materials such as aluminum sheets, bolts and other supplies that he uses to make his bread-making machinery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1187285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy aluminum sheets and bolts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":123.7},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":135.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":151.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":160.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":172.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101,"local_amount":252.51,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":263.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447539},{"amount":54.33,"local_amount":135.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":141.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188363},{"amount":117.17,"local_amount":292.93,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":305.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572295},{"amount":327.5,"local_amount":818.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":854.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121940}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T12:32:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":468909,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan Carlos tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad y se dedica a ofrecer servicios de consultor\u00eda en software y hardware;  desde muy joven le gust\u00f3 aprender el desarrollo de programas de computaci\u00f3n, mantenimiento y reparaci\u00f3n de equipos de inform\u00e1tica.

The group\u2019s representative is called Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana, and is pictured with her hand raised in the photo. This is the first time that this group has requested financial assistance from Alid\u00e9, and they have done so to increase their business levels. \r\n\r\nAblawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana is 39 years of age, and is married to Sylvain. The couple has three children, all of whom are at school but none of whom are dependent on them. Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana lives with her children and husband, and she and her husband make sure that the various household expenses are covered. \r\n\r\nAblawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana went to school until secondary level, and about 10 years ago started her business selling fabrics, shoe, kitchen utensils, and perfume in a Benin neighborhood. She gets her supplies in a market in Benin and in Togo. Customer demand is growing, and given her limited means, she can no longer meet their requests. Due to this, and because of her lack of resources, Ablawa B\u00e9n\u00e9dicta Tatiana and the other members of the Jesukpego 7 group have requested their first joint loan from Alid\u00e9.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1194180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

cual tuvo que trasladarse  para realizar sus estudios de econom\u00eda en la Universidad P\u00fablica del Valle. Gracias a su dedicaci\u00f3n y buen desempe\u00f1o, fue apoyada por la universidad para cubrir los costos de su matr\u00edcula, al igual que fue merecedora de ayudas otorgadas por la instituci\u00f3n a personas con dificultades econ\u00f3micas y con buen desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico. Estos apoyos le permitieron culminar satisfactoriamente sus estudios de pregrado. \n\nEl traslado a esta nueva ciudad fue todo un reto, no solo por lo que significaba encontrarse con un mundo diferente y desconocido, sino tambi\u00e9n por la necesidad de afrontar condiciones asociadas a una dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica por la que pasaba su familia en ese momento; con su madre desempleada y su padre fallecido se vio en la necesidad de combinar sus estudios diurnos con diferentes trabajos que le permitieran formarse como profesional. \n\nAhora, Karina tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una Maestr\u00eda en el Reino Unido para lo cual ha venido prepar\u00e1ndose desde que culmino sus estudios de pregrado y la \u00fanica forma para pagar los ex\u00e1menes y gastos de aplicaci\u00f3n es recibiendo el apoyo de Kiva.\n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \n\nActualmente, trabajo para una organizaci\u00f3n que busca el desarrollo y la mejora de la calidad de vida de las familias vulnerables en el Valle del Cauca, trabajo que desarrollo con amor y dedicaci\u00f3n buscando que muchas personas as\u00ed como yo tambi\u00e9n tengan acceso a oportunidades que les permitan cambiar su historia. \n\nEl apoyo de Kiva me permitir\u00eda seguir adelante con mis sue\u00f1os siendo un apoyo fundamental para fortalecer las competencias que requiero para la postulaci\u00f3n y posterior ingreso a la universidad (TOEFL, Documentos de inscripci\u00f3n), gastos que en este momento y sin este mecanismo serian muy complicados de cubrir impidi\u00e9ndome llevar a cabo el sue\u00f1o en el que llevo trabajando por m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os. \n\nEste es un sue\u00f1o que espero compartir una vez regrese al pa\u00eds dedic\u00e1ndome a seguir ayudando a las personas menos favorecidas, trabajando en un organismo Gubernamental para  la investigaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas destinadas al desarrollo social y econ\u00f3mico de poblaciones vulnerables, buscando de esta manera mecanismos concretos de apoyo para que los ni\u00f1os y  j\u00f3venes de nuestro pa\u00eds tengan mejores oportunidades as\u00ed como yo las pude tener alg\u00fan d\u00eda.\n","en":"\r\nKarina, age 29, was born in Buga, a small city that is close to the place where she had to move for her study of Economics at the Universidad P\u00fablica del Valle.  Thanks to her dedication and good effort, the university supported her in order to cover the cost of her tuition.  She was also deserving of other help the institution gave to people with financial difficulties and good academic performance.  These supports allowed her to satisfactorily complete her undergraduate studies.\r\n\r\nThe move to this new city was a complete challenge.  This is because it meant not only encountering a new, different, and unknown world, but also because of the need to face conditions associated with the difficult financial situation her family was experiencing at the time.  With her mother unemployed and her father having passed away, she saw the need to combine her daily studies with different jobs that allowed her to receive a professional education.\r\n\r\nNow Karina\u2019s dream is to get a master\u2019s degree in the United Kingdom.  In order to do so, she has been preparing herself ever since she completed her undergraduate studies.  The only way to pay for the exams and the application expenses is to receive Kiva\u2019s support.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nI now work for an organization that seeks to develop and improve the quality of life for vulnerable families in the Valle del Cauca.  I do this work with love and dedication as I look for people like me to also have access to opportunities that will allow them to change their lives.\r\n\r\nSupport from Kiva would allow me to continue on with my dreams.  It would be a fundamental support to strengthen the proficiency that I need for application and later for tuition at the university (TOEL, registration documents).  These are expenses that, at this time and without this loan, would be very difficult to cover.  These expenses would keep me from realizing the dream I have been working on for over three years.\r\n\r\nThis is a dream I hope to share once I return to the country.  I will be devoting myself to helping other people who are less fortunate.  I will be working with a government agency to investigate and carry out public policies for the social and economic development of vulnerable populations.  In this way I will be looking for concrete mechanisms to support children and young people in our country to one day have better opportunities just like I did.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1195281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the application expenses for her studies to get her master's degree in economic development.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042085},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710434},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-28T09:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.9,"payment_id":450401462},{"amount":68.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-24T08:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.33,"payment_id":459082492},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895248},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118016},{"amount":158.67,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":285282.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504236994},{"amount":53.83,"local_amount":95000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96792.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517523758},{"amount":70.6,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":127358.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":530535509},{"amount":129.84,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-23T10:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":254716.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.83,"payment_id":561631627}],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T17:51:57Z","paid_date":"2014-11-23T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":470705,"name":"Florissa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Florissa, a 36-year-old resident of Caloocan, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEstela operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEstela dreams to have their own house through all her hard work on her business.

She has one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy spare parts and accessories for the motorcycle, as well as to maintain it. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMaribel dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies at these meetings. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He also works in construction during the summer, but he mainly earns his living from selling livestock.  Because of this, he wants to grow his business and increase the size of his herd.  While livestock is at a low price, he plans to buy two cows and feed them until the winter, when he will then sell them at a reasonable price.  Uktam currently owns three large dairy cows that he also needs to feed, so he is applying for a loan to buy the two cows and their feed.  His plans for the future include educating his children, improving his living situation and buying some necessary household appliances.

She started a business five years ago with the goal of providing for her family's needs, as her husband is a taxi driver and does not earn enough to support the family.  She has a store near the central hospital where she sells food and dry goods.  A few years ago, Farida's life took a difficult turn when her husband suddenly became ill and underwent surgery.  After the operation, her husband couldn't work for two years.  She thought long and hard about the solution to the problem of how to feed her family and decided to rent a storefront and borrow money from relatives.  At first, it was very difficult, but she gradually grew accustomed and learned the skills of her trade.  Farida is a second-time borrower with our organization.  She has a good credit history and wants to expand her business so she can increase her income.  She wants to use the proceeds from her business to educate her children.  She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1193763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

May God bless you.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1186662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy cleaning supplies, rice, oil and soft-drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":72790},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82189},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86069},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88077},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90132},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92235},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94388},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96590},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98844},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101150},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":113429}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":72790,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75602.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387494},{"amount":46.7,"local_amount":82189,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85364.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994324},{"amount":47.78,"local_amount":84107,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":87356.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130676},{"amount":48.91,"local_amount":86069,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":89394.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519534},{"amount":50.04,"local_amount":88077,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497596},{"amount":103.62,"local_amount":182367,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":189412.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527408},{"amount":53.63,"local_amount":94388,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":98034.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928176},{"amount":54.88,"local_amount":96590,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100321.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705347},{"amount":60.24,"local_amount":106021,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":110117.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967645},{"amount":57.57,"local_amount":101318,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105232.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816864},{"amount":60.27,"local_amount":106084,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":110182.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323173}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T16:38:53Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":463692,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 36-year-old, married woman from Tiribe, Kenya.

Unfortunately, Magnifique\u2019s family was forced to flee from the war in DRC, and he has grown up as a refugee in Namibia.\n \nMagnifique shows a passion for empowering youth to make better choices. Magnifique has an interest in youth entertainment and  showed that he has entreprenieral skills when he started his own production initiative called MN Productions to encourage youth that they can have fun without alcohol.  He continued to develop this entertainment company to provide safe entertainment for young people even though he faced a few challenges along the way (not all young people were interested in his idea of alcohol free entertainment!) To further develop his interest in the entertainment industry, Magnifique interned with an audio company to train himself in the mechanics of running technical audio systems. \n\nMagnifique is also particularly environmentally conscious. He created the R CUBED Committee (Recycle x Reduce and Re-use) in his high school, which he says allowed for his peers to have an avenue to make their science classes practical. \u201cIt is important for students to be involved in things they care about\u201d, says Magnifique. \u201cSchool is about implementing accessed information and not just remembering it for exams,\u201d he says. \n\nMagnifique\u2019s impressive leadership skills have been apparent from a young age. At the age of only 16, Magnifique became the Junior Deputy Mayor of the Rehoboth Junior Town Council \u2013 a prestigious position that he was selected for by his school principal based on his leadership potential.  As a member of the Junior Council, he was extremely involved and even has the opportunity to attend the Youth 21 Global Youth Leadership Forum on Inclusive Governance in Nairobi, Kenya. \n\nMagnifique is passionate about physical sciences and mathematics. He is especially interested in alien life and robotics \u2013 he has even already started designing his own robotic modules. He hopes to one day become one of the world\u2019s greatest scientists. A true entrepreneur, Magnifique hopes to one day open a bank in Africa that will grants dreams and ideas the opportunity to grown and be sustainable. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1194356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magnifique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748403},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735286},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614219},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629743},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668055},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159792}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T02:27:07Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":469614,"name":"Kombe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kombe lives in the Mariakani area of Coast province, Kenya.

He sees problems as challenges to be overcome \u2013 the traits of a true entrepreneur. This quality was shown clearly when, during secondary school in Kenya, Dawit noticed that students in his school were not focused on their education and had trouble understanding the material. Dawit decided to do something about the problem and formed a club called \u201cFuture Leaders\u201d aimed at tutoring young students. Through this club, he coordinated a group of top students in the 11th and 12th grades to tutor other students three days a week. Thanks to Dawit\u2019s initiative, many students dramatically improved their academic performance and many also started to have a more positive attitude towards their education. \n\nIn his short 17 years, Dawit has demonstrated compassion of the highest degree. When one of his friends lost his father from AIDS and the family began to struggle economically to the point where they were unable to pay for food and rent, Dawit took it on himself to raise money for his friend\u2019s family by organizing a community Iddir (traditional saving mechanism in Ethiopia). Furthermore, he even started a non-governmental organization called Tesfagoh that supports and takes care of HIV carriers. In doing so, he was able to raise the money to help his friend's family and also increase awareness regarding HIV\/AIDS.  \n\nAcademically, Dawit has always been a high achieving student.  In secondary school in Kenya, he was among the top performing students in all of his classes. In recognition of his leadership and academic excellence, Dawit was given the opportunity to participate in a forum on women\u2019s education in Ethiopia held in Addis Ababa.\n\nDawit is also passionate about environmental conservation and climate change. He has been instrumental in creating awareness about these issues in his school, using drama as a medium. As Dawit\u2019s knowledge of environmental issues has grown, so too has the impact of his awareness campaigns. Dawit was able to share his knowledge with villagers in his community, to whom he was able to teach sustainable methods of planting and growing seeds.

They all belong to the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica is one of the members of this communal bank. In the picture she is the fifth person from the right, wearing black pants and a black jacket, with brown long hair. She has worked selling sunflower seeds for one year. These seeds can be used in different ways: to make oil, to feed animals, or for human consumption. She says she works from home, where she roasts the sunflower seeds and packs them for sale. She works Monday through Sunday and distributes her schedule according to her availability.\r\n\r\nShe buys whatever merchandise and supplies she needs to sell her sunflower seeds from distributors, and at the supermarket she buys low-cost bags to pack the seeds, which are the most affordable.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan only to purchase sunflower seeds.\r\n\r\nOne of M\u00f3nica's goals is to purchase some items, such as ice cream, to sell in addition to the sunflower seeds and generate more income so that she may access a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica lives with her husband and their two children, who are sixteen and nine and are in school. On a business level, her dreams are to expand her business and grow as a microentrepreneur by adding more and more products to sell so that she can offer her family good stability in life.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has given her, because it has allowed her to invest in her business. She also feels very comfortable around the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank group, because they share different activities and interests, and that provides some leisure. As far as the trainings offered at the meetings, they have helped her manage her business better.\r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central area of the country. It constitutes the administrative, financial, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of Chile's central valley. In Chile, there is a curious saying about Talca: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (Talca, Paris, and London). Among the myths explaining this, some say it is derived from something originally said by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London) on account of the fog that frequently covers the city during the winter season, as it does in the capital of the United Kingdom. (Both phrases sound virtually the same in Spanish).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1188206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sunflower seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1682960,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110473},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":111552},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":121155},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117716},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":118524},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118254},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":121089},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":120956},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121779},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":122608},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":123445},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":124285},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125128},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":125996}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":718.8,"local_amount":343180,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":345382.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147860},{"amount":1249.46,"local_amount":596539,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":600368.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381017},{"amount":1030.75,"local_amount":492117,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":495275.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988167},{"amount":525.99,"local_amount":251124,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":252735.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331124644}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T09:04:25Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":470902,"name":"Latifeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Latifeh is a 56-year-old conservative married woman, so she asked her son to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nLatifeh wishes for her son to complete his studies and get his BA degree.
