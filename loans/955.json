For this reason he unfortunately was not able to finish primary school, and he was not able to pursue a professional degree in Agricultural Engineering as he wanted to, although he really would have liked to do so. In his free time, he likes to spend time in the countryside, and sometimes his wife spoils him by cooking him his favorite food, such as the delicious Seco de Res [stewed beef].\r\n \r\nWith great dedication and enthusiasm, and thanks to what he learned from his parents, Jos\u00e9 works in agriculture. He has a small plot of land where he plants camu camu, which is a typical fruit of his city. In addition, he also has small plantings of watermelon, yuca and corn. Every day he starts his work at an early hour. He can work approximately 12 hours a day, and he believes that it is going well for him because of his dedication and the friendly treatment he provides to his customers. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help provided to him he will be able to maintain, fertilize and irrigate his crops. In this way, Jos\u00e9 will be able to ensure that his crops develop in a satisfactory way and that they are in optimal condition for harvest and sale. Thus he hopes to obtain a higher income, which will help him very much so that in the near future, he will be able to expand his business and improve his family's quality of life.

booth at one of city markets, where she trades in men's and women's clothing.  Ovsanna would like to refresh the clothing variety in her booth for the autumn-winter season.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nI'm Simon, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration at the Maharishi Institute. I am the fifth in a family of eight and I was raised by a single parent, my mother. As two of my siblings are also studying, we survive off of my mother's wages as a domestic worker and my sister's part-time salary as a waitress. I enjoy dance, drama, music and playing instruments. \r\n\r\nI want to be a well-developed human being who will have an impact in the business industry. Initially I'd like to work for probably three years at a well-established company like Anglo-American, and then I'd like to open my own businesses. My long term goals are to start a music school, and also start a transport business for long-distance trips. Finally I plan to buy shares from well-developed companies and go into business franchise. Education is important because it is the most valuable treasure, and I believe will open closed doors for me. It is a gift that no one can take away from me.

would like to work in port administration in Indonesia. He comes from the village of Kapuas Hulu, in the upper Kapuas River, the largest river in Kalimantan Island, Indonesia. The local conditions and the situation of his origin motivate him to learn and aspire to be a professional employee in a harbor. \r\n\r\nHowever, Bonevasius faces difficulties in his studies because his two parents have died. During this time, he was funded by his siblings, but his siblings are now married and each has a child.

As proof, there are various enterprising families who began some years ago with small businesses and who are now microentrepreneurs who contribute to the generation of employment. Studies reveal that majority of businesses began empirically and were welcomed by the passing of tourists, businesspeople, and travelers that move from one region to the other. Furthermore, it is the third most populous city in the country.

She is a hard working and enterprising woman, happy and charismatic. She is married to Lucio who is a teacher, and they have 3 children, Leyder, Patricia and Elar of 26, 23, and 21 years of age respectively, living in their own house which they managed to buy through their many efforts.\r\n\r\nGilda sells food, from a menu with extra dishes, in a small facility that she adapted in her own home, where she put the tables and chairs needed to accommodate her customers, with delicious dishes, with good homemade flavors that she learned from her mother, earning the appreciation of her clients. She also sews undergarments in the evenings, winning many clients through her good service. She started her business more than six years ago, and has an assistant helping whom she pays monthly. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work because she has an income that helps her husband with the household expenses, because many times the earnings of her husband as an employee of a private entity was not enough, so she decided to start her business. On the other hand she does not like it because she is exhausted at the end of each working day. But that does not discourage her and she continues working wanting to get ahead. This is why she has plans to grow her business, improving the atmosphere and varying the dishes, and also she wants to sell vegetables in front of her house.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan through MFP.

The activity will help the community in that it will provide tailoring services at short notice or distance and offer it services at a lower cost to community members. \r\n\r\nThe profits will be use to better the standards of living of her entire family, that is, nutrition, healthcare, and education.  The rest of it will plough back into the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1192935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy a sewing machine, buttons, and cloth material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She is a hard-working and happy woman. She is married to Ricardo, who is employed and is the father of two children. The first is 14 years old and is of school age, while the younger is a pretty and robust recently born baby of 6 months, who is one more reason for Liz to work hard to offer them a better quality of life. Liz's business is selling cold soft drinks and candies of various flavors and brands. To do this, she has a refrigerator that she bought with her savings. This is where she keeps her soft drinks cold. She installed her shelves at the front of her own house, where she serves her products to her customers. She began with a loan from MFP more than a year ago and tends her business alone, serving her customers in a cordial manner. From time to time, she also makes decorations for children's parties. She feels that her business is profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be at home and care for her little children, whom she loves very much, in addition to having the economic income to pay the household expenses. On the other hand, she doesn't like it when it rains a lot, since it is difficult for her to sell her products, since she depends a lot on the weather to improve her sales. But this does not discourage her, and she has plans to continue and to increase the variety of her products. This is her 12th loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have a loan so that she can complete her goals. On her part, she promises to be on time with her payments and thus stay on good terms with the group (communal bank) she belongs to, since they are all very responsible and very good.\r\n\r\nOf the 1400 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest it all in the purchase of soft drinks and candies of various brands and flavors to have a ready stock for sale, seeking lower prices by making her purchases for cash and in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1189826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks and various brands of candies for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":215.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":212.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":231.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":240.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":244.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":256.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.66,"local_amount":215.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":220.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452375},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":212.25,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":217.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447556},{"amount":90.92,"local_amount":231.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":237.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053454},{"amount":94.31,"local_amount":240.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":246.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188379},{"amount":95.96,"local_amount":244.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":250.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572310},{"amount":100.77,"local_amount":256.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":262.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121969}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T22:57:00Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":471341,"name":"Iluminada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iluminada, 56 years old, is a patient mother with three children who are presently working and have own families.

Because of this big household, she has struggled to provide for her children's basic needs, with rice cultivation being the main source of income. To supplement the family's income, she also raises pigs at home while her husband works for others for a fee and produces palm-sugar to sell. \r\n\r\nHaving been in this business for several years, she is able to make about 23,500 KHR per day. Rom took her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner) one cycle ago and completely paid back the loan. The previous loan has helped her to grow her cash-crop and to better support her household especially paying for her children's education. \r\n\r\nNow, she is applying for a second-cycle loan with an amount of 1,000,000 KHR. She will use this loan to buy fertilizer for her rice farm and to buy a cow to support her business including for plowing.

She is separated and mother to four children aged between 2 and 8 years of age, three of whom are already at school. She opened a small food store a year ago, which she manages in a neighborhood of the capital. Thanks to her experience in this area and her warm welcome and rapport with the locals, she has been able to build up a very large customer base. \r\n\r\nThe constant increase in Minette\u2019s customer base means that supply is lower than demand, and loans are therefore important for her business. Thanks to these loans she has been able to buy basic goods (a box of soap, bag of rice, box of sugar and cubes), which will allow her to easily satisfy her customers, increase her sales and have a higher profit margin. Minette plans to reinvest part of her profits in her business, while the rest will allow her to provide for her family, for which she is responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1194895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To buy basic goods (a box of soap, bag of rice, box of sugar and cubes).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20683},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21468},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22253},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23038},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23823},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24608},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25392},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26177},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26962},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27747},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28532},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29317}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":20683,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21098.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914928},{"amount":42.93,"local_amount":21468,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":21898.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047162},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":22253,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":22699.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436956},{"amount":1.35,"local_amount":674,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":687.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989374},{"amount":92.37,"local_amount":46187,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":47113.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622986},{"amount":377.47,"local_amount":188735,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":192522.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842197}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T12:22:55Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lambert","image":1083859}},{"id":471369,"name":"Geofrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geofrey is a 46-year-old married man.

She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her pig-raising business and also hopes to feed her pigs to be fat and healthy so as to sell them for a good price to gain more income to improve her family's living condition. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1192967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy piglets for raising.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T11:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T11:20:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1600000},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118851},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":202750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265926},{"amount":320,"local_amount":1280000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1297600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197290},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":405500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046595},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1216500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942028}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T13:43:30Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":471392,"name":"Viviana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Viviana is 56 years old with four children.

She is a widow and mother to two children, one of whom is a student at a local public school in the community. From a one-hectare area of farmland, she can grow rice as a main source of income; she also adds to her income by selling clothes and grocery items. She can make about KHR 33,000 per day from the current business that she has been with for 25 years. Her main challenge is lack of water supply for her rice field.

She has two children; one of whom is dependent on her. She and her husband are rice farmers, who have been in farming to make a living for several years in order to better support their family. Her husband sometimes works as a paid construction worker in the local area. From the current business, she is able to earn about KHR 24,000 per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. Low crop yield has been the main challenge for her rice farming business. \r\n\r\nSokun\u2019s group consists of three members who are all females.

Meanchey, Cambodia. She has three dependent children. She has farmed rice on one hectare of farmland for ten years and has been involved in growing beans to supplement her family\u2019s income for several years. The current business earns her approximately 25,000KHR per day and manages her to save about 10,000KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses for future needs.\r\n\r\nSoma has been with VisionFund for one cycle while the other member is just the first cycled client with VisionFund.

mother of four children who currently are living with her. To meet the daily basic expenses in her household, Mean has been farming on one hectare of farmland for 45 years, earning about 14,000 KHR per day. Besides helping in the rice field, Mean\u2019s husband also helps with a pig-raising business. For this couple, their main challenge is the insufficient water supply for her paddy field. \r\n\r\nIncluding this cycle, Mean has joined VisionFund (Kiva's partner) for two cycles. With success, she has paid back the entire first loan which has helped her to afford working capital to buy fertilizer for her rice farm and additional pigs to raise. Also, she has received a decent income from her business. Now she forms a group of four female members; three members, including her, are in the second-cycle seeking 1,200,000 KHR each while a remaining fellow group member is in the fourth-cycle applying for 500,000 KHR. As the group leader, Mean will use her loan portion to buy more fertilizer and to pump water for her farm. She also will use a portion of it to buy pig feed. She expects to receive more profit from her cash-crop so as to stabilize her lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1193116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

His mother lives with him. With the loan, he wants to buy another milk cow. He already has three, and he wants his business to grow. He plans to produce more milk, cream and cheese in order to sell these products at the local market and other places in the area, and thus increase his income and have a better quality of life. This is his first loan with field partner Fudecosur. He never even took out a loan with a state bank: he turned to Fudecosur because of the much lower interest rates and the less strict granting conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1190138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Since she began to generate an income, the economic conditions in her home have improved considerably, which has been allowed her husband and her 3 children to enjoy a higher quality of life.

Since that time, she has been making sandals and handbags which she sells to neighbors, friends and customers who are referred to her. She decided to start her business so that she could generate income, which she uses to contribute to her household and achieve a better quality of life for her husband and their 4 children, since they were in a very difficult economic situation. The greatest advantage she has is that she can manage her own time, so that she can offer her children the time they need, preparing their food and getting them ready for school. Thanks to the fact that she has had good sales recently, Luz Marina is seeking a loan to buy synthetic material, soles and threads so she can fulfill orders she was not able to fill due to a lack of capital. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to help her family get ahead, providing them with a good quality of life and better economic opportunities. In addition, in the future she hopes to be able to have her own house. She also aspires to have her own shoe store one day, where she can offer her own products.
