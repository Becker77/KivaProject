Cuando naci\u00f3 su primer hijo se dedic\u00f3 al hogar y dej\u00f3 atr\u00e1s la actividad, pues no ten\u00eda quien cuidara de su hijo y a pesar de que las condiciones econ\u00f3micas de su hogar se deterioraban no ten\u00eda otra opci\u00f3n. Hace 1 mes retorn\u00f3 al negocio y decidi\u00f3 hacerlo de manera independiente montando su propio negocio, y aunque comenz\u00f3 con muy poco capital y muy pocas unidades de yogurt a la semana, ahora su negocio ha crecido y tiene buenos pedidos por parte de sus clientes. Yajaiza manifiesta que su mayor ventaja es poder trabajar en su casa y estar al cuidado de sus 2 hijos de 3 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, y al mismo aportar econ\u00f3micamente junto con su esposo al sostenimiento econ\u00f3mico. Ahora que su negocio ha captado muy buenos clientes y tiene la oportunidad de vender grandes cantidades, Yajaiza busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un fog\u00f3n, ollas, canecas lecheras, y materia prima para poder hacer crecer el negocio.\n\nDe esta manera espera superar la dificultad de capital que tiene y sacar adelante su propio negocio, con el que su esposo y sus 2 hijos tengan una mejor calidad de vida gracias a sus ingresos y en un futuro puedan tener mejores condiciones econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"Yajaiza took classes nine years ago in dairy processing and then she learned much more about it working in a business over the course of four years. When her first son was born, she devoted herself to home life and left her other activities behind, since she did not have anyone to care for her son and in spite of the fact that the economic conditions in her home deteriorated, she did not have a choice.\r\n\r\nOne month ago she returned to her business and she decided to do it independently by setting up her own business. Even though she started with very little capital and very few units of yogurt per week, now her business has grown and she has good orders from her customers. Yajaiza states that her biggest advantage is to be able to work in her house and be caring for her two children who are 3 and 5 years old at the same time as she is contributing economically, together with her husband, to the support of the household.\r\n\r\nNow that her business has captured very good clients and she has the opportunity to sell large quantities, Yajaiza is seeking a loan to be able to buy a stove, pots, milk cans, and raw materials to be able to grow her business. In this way she hopes to overcome the trouble she has had with capital and propel her business forward. With this loan, her husband and two children will have a better quality of life thanks to their income, and in the future they can be in better economic conditions and they will progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1190666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The difficulty she has is that since she does not have the right machine, she cannot make whole clothing, and her payment is very low. For this reason, Flor is requesting a loan to purchase an overlock sewing machine which will allow her to take orders for whole clothing and her income will increase considerably.\r\n\r\nFlor hopes that the economic conditions in her home improve considerably, and that her two children will be able to have a better quality of life and access to a better quality education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1190683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Besides working on the rice field, this couple also raises pigs at home for additional income. The current business that she has been with for 11 years earns her about 13,000 riels (KHR) per day. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle for Sokhoeurn and her fellow group member (they are in the same group of two female members). She and her co-member are applying for loan portions of 700,000 KHR and 500,000 KHR, respectively.

The loan will be used to buy more paint, iron sheets, varnish and cement, and will help Dennis to generate greater profits and increase his family's prospects.

At present, she is single and has no children, since she would like to prepare herself for that phase both emotionally and economically. She lives in her parents' house with her parents and her sister, and together they strive every day to improve their quality of life. Carla's work is selling clothing of various brands and different sizes, colors and styles, for men, women and children. She personally takes charge of buying the garments wholesale and selecting them one by one, always thinking about what her customers will like most and the comfort they will feel while wearing the clothing she sells. She has help from her mother with her work. She has already done this work for 3 years, working at her house or visiting some other homes. She has been able to build up a list of steady customers among friends and family members. Sometimes she sells on credit, and other times for cash, and she receives good earnings which help her to stay ahead of her expenses. She really likes what she does, because she has the freedom to manage her time and organize herself according to her customers' availability. At first, like any person who has just started a business, she had some areas of insecurity, but over time she was able to overcome them, and now the business is a great generator of income in her household economy. She hopes to set up a clothing store so that she can keep contributing to her family's progress. This is loan number 3 for her with the MFP institution. She feels happy to know that she has access to a line of credit to move forward with her business. For this reason, she is committed to being responsible with her loan payments, so she can continue in the future. She notes that she likes the work of her communal bank because she considers them a responsible and united group. With the amount she is requesting, 1000 soles, she will buy a great quantity of clothing, including shirts, blouses and pants, which are popular among her customers. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1190742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy shirts, blouses and pants to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":171.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":183.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.58,"local_amount":153.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452376},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":151.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":158.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447560},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053458},{"amount":68.6,"local_amount":171.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":179.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188395},{"amount":69.8,"local_amount":174.51,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":182.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572314},{"amount":73.22,"local_amount":183.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":191.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121973}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T18:29:37Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":471526,"name":"Adwowa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwowa sells saucepans  at Mpredwow.

Despite the fact that in the beginning the earnings from the business were very low due to the fact that she could do only the sewing process with her machine, being able to care for her four children from home made her quality of life improve considerably.  Thanks to her efforts her tailoring workshop has been growing and with the same earnings from the business she has bought more machinery, which has permitted her to do other tailoring processes and so, little by little, she has more opportunities for work.  Currently she has large orders from her clients but as she doesn\u2019t have the proper machine she must perform the sewing process two times and so Maria is looking for a loan to be able to buy a twin needle sewing machine and thus speed up her production in order to get more work.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to come to have a large tailoring workshop where she can generate employment for other relatives who are in financial difficulty.  She also aspires to be able to have a better income for her household and that this will permit her to offer her four children and her husband a better quality of life and greater economic opportunities in order to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1190690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

pudo construir su casa con mucho esfuerzo y que ahora puede disfrutar habit\u00e1ndola con su familia. La actividad de Emerson, como todos los d\u00edas, es de conducir mototaxi, realiza su trabajo por las principales calles de la ciudad en busca de sus eventuales pasajeros a quienes transporta hasta su destino con bastante serenidad ya que considera que la seguridad de sus clientes es lo m\u00e1s importante, de la misma manera siempre brinda su numero de celular para que pueda ser contactado por alg\u00fan cliente que necesita de su servicio de transporte. Los 5 a\u00f1os de experiencia y la calidad de su trabajo lo coloca como una pieza clave en el oficio que desarrolla. Tiene tambi\u00e9n un puesto de venta de abarrotes en un mercado de la ciudad pero que lamentablemente est\u00e1 decayendo, es por eso que ahora quiere dedicarse a la venta de ropa porque lo considera m\u00e1s rentable y de esta forma complementar su trabajo como mototaxista. Aunque al principio no le fue muy bien, afirma que ahora esa situaci\u00f3n ha cambiado y sus ingresos se han visto multiplicados gracias a las recomendaciones de algunos de sus clientes a quienes prest\u00f3 sus servicios. Ahora espera continuar trabajando como mototaxista y en un plazo relativamente corto desea consolidar su negocio de venta de ropa. Este es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 4 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Es por eso que agradece a quienes hacen posible este financiamiento que le ayudar\u00e1 a cumplir con sus objetivos. Por otro lado, comenta sentirse a gusto con su banco comunal, pues conoce a sus integrantes y los considera personas responsables y solidarias.\nEl monto solicitado 2000 soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en la refacci\u00f3n de su mototaxi para que funcione de manera \u00f3ptima, otra parte del dinero lo invertir\u00e1 en el acondicionamiento de su local de venta de ropa. \n\n","en":"Emerson is 30 years old. He is an honest and very kind man who has always worked hard so that he can offer a better quality of life to his family. He lives with his partner Idaura, and they have a two-year-old son. \r\n\r\nCurrently he lives on a plece of land belonging to his mother-in-law, where they have provided him a space where, with much effort, he was able to build his house. Now he can enjoy living in it with his family. Emerson's day to day work is driving a mototaxi. \r\n\r\nHe carries on his work around the main streets of the city, seeking his casual passengers, whom he transports to their destination quite calmly, as he considers that the safety of his customers is the most important thing. In the same way, he always offers his cell number so that he can be contacted by some client who needs his transportation service. \r\n\r\nHis five years of experience and the quality of his work make him a key figure in his trade. \r\n\r\nHe also has a stand selling groceries in a market in the city, but business is unfortunately declining. That is why he now wants to sell clothing, because he considers it more profitable and wants to complement his work as a mototaxi operator in this way. \r\n\r\nAlthough at the beginning things were not going very well, he says that that situation has changed and his income has multiplied, thanks to the recommendations of some of his customers to whom he provided his services. \r\n\r\nNow he hopes to continue working as a mototaxi operator, and within a relatively short time, wishes to build up his clothes-selling stand.  \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with the MFP institution. That is why he is grateful to those who make possible this loan that will help him fulfill his objectives.

She is a widow, and for this reason had to raise her two children alone.  They are now grown and financially independent, but live near her.  She has her own home, where she also takes in her grandchildren.  She works a great deal, as she would like to have a higher standard of living and be able to live out her senior years in peace.  Mirna\u2019s work involves food sales.  She works in her house, generally at night, but on weekends can work all day and starts very early.  Her daily food staple is chicken soup, whereas on weekends the public prefers her delicious ceviche and grilled foods.  She has been in this business for more than 5 years, and carries out this work with the support of her son and daughter-in-law. Since she started this enterprise, her finances have been improving.  She continues with this work because it\u2019s allowed her to use her earnings to carry out other activities such as room and rickshaw rentals.\r\n\r\nShe is currently not in good health, which is why she will dedicate herself only to the rentals business.  She very much enjoys her work because it uses her culinary skills, but she knows that she is at the stage where this will end because of her health.  For this reason, she wants to devote all her priorities to economic activities that won\u2019t demand too much effort, yet continue to generate the income her family needs to live peacefully.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan with MFP.  She thanks all those people who have provided her the opportunity to access credit so she can finalize her plans.  She comments that she likes belonging to her cooperative bank as she knows all the members and considers them to be responsible and unified people.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,500 Peruvian soles requested, she will buy some ingredients necessary to prepare the food she sells.  However, she will invest the majority of the funds into repairing her rickshaw so that it works perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1190855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for preparing food, and also to send her vehicle to a mechanic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-17T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-17T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":230.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":227.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":247.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":257.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":261.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.45,"local_amount":230.75,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":230.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452378},{"amount":87.13,"local_amount":227.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":227.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447564},{"amount":95,"local_amount":247.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":247.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053462},{"amount":98.54,"local_amount":257.06,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":257.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188400},{"amount":100.26,"local_amount":261.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":261.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572319},{"amount":105.62,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":275.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121978}],"funded_date":"2012-09-18T16:45:43Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":471671,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon, 63 years old, is a responsible mother who is engaged in a hog-raising business.

She first sold only to friends and family in her home, but now she sells her products by offering them directly to her customers by going house to house and selling them at comfortable prices.  The clothing that she sells if brought from another city where she can buy it in bulk and then she sells the pieces individually.  They are characterized by the quality of the material from which they are made and by the vanguard designs that can be found in each model.  She also has worked for the past 7 years selling candies in the streets of her city.  What she likes best about her work is that it allows her to decide her own schedule.  She can manage her own time and dedicate herself to different activities.  She thinks that the most difficult thing is that initially she has to move a huge quantity of merchandise, although this burden diminishes the faster she is able to sell her clothing in the houses that she visits.  In spite of this challenge she does not get discouraged and she continues to move forward in her work.  She hopes to have a formal clothing store where she can exhibit her inventory and be more tranquil.  This is her first credit with MFP, and she thanks all of those who make her credit possible so that she can continue with her objectives.  She promises to comply with the loan payment requirements in a punctual manner.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank since all of the members are very kind and supportive.  With the requested loan of 1500 soles (Peruvian currency), she will buy different items of clothing, principally polos, blouses, and lingerie that she hopes to sell quickly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1190861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy different items of clothing, principally polos, blouses, and lingerie that she hopes to sell quickly.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-17T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-17T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":230.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":227.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":247.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":257.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":261.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.45,"local_amount":230.75,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":230.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452379},{"amount":87.13,"local_amount":227.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":227.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447565},{"amount":95,"local_amount":247.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":247.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053463},{"amount":98.54,"local_amount":257.06,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":257.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188401},{"amount":100.26,"local_amount":261.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":261.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572320},{"amount":105.62,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":275.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121979}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T00:57:06Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":471674,"name":"Juvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvie lives in Malaubang, Ozamis City.

She is very creative, but she recognizes that she is just beginning in this field and she hopes to supply her sewing shop with everything necessary in order to do good work.  She is happy with her activities since they provide necessary income in order to meet family expenses.  Also, the contact with the public is what makes her feel good every day.  Now she hopes that her grocery store will continue improving and similarly that her sewing shop will continue to progress for the good of her family.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she is thankful to all of the people who continue supporting the organization so that she can access once again this financing which will help her increase her working capital.

the city of Ica in the Santiago district.  She loves her children, and they are her main reason for living.  Sadly, for a number of reasons, Juana separated from her partner.  Ever since, she has dedicated all of her efforts to get ahead with her family.  Juana was not able to study for the nursing degree that she desired, but she would have liked to have been able to do that.

She works daily for about 8 hours, and during this time she serves about 30 customers.  She believes that her business is doing well because of her good prices and because of the kind treatment she provides to her customers.\r\n\r\nJuana is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they are providing, she will be able to purchase merchandise such as: pumpkins, limes, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, and other vegetables.  In this way, Juana will be better able to stock up her business, and with this extra merchandise she hopes to be able to increase her sales and her earnings.  This will help her to acquire her own store in the near future, so that she can realize her greatest dream, which is to see her children become good professionals and good men. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1190755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy merchandise, including vegetables and tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTIAGO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.160833 -72.257222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-09-17T02:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-17T02:40:26Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":123.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":130.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":133.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":140.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":145.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":152.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":159.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":164.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":178.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":123.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":123.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109350},{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":130.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":130.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345565},{"amount":51.28,"local_amount":133.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":133.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954768},{"amount":54.02,"local_amount":140.91,"processed_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":141.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089174},{"amount":55.68,"local_amount":145.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":145.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478719},{"amount":58.46,"local_amount":152.48,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":152.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031403},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":159.56,"processed_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":159.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775904},{"amount":63.01,"local_amount":164.38,"processed_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":164.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482720},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":171.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":171.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372888806},{"amount":68.4,"local_amount":178.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":178.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381663748}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T17:57:40Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:35:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":472692,"name":"Yelian Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"YELIAN est un groupe de trois personnes, dont les membres exercent les m\u00eames activit\u00e9s au B\u00e9nin.

He has been doing this work for 15 years. He likes his work since it allows him to have time to be at the side of his family, in addition to being able to drive his children to school and to the different places they need to go. He remembers that he began this work when he was very young, and little by little he gained experience, thanks to the days of work that at times became very uncomfortable when the sun was very strong or when there was so much rain that some parts of the city flooded. He hopes to continue working and, true to his style, continue bringing his family the tranquility to be able to grow. This is his 4th loan with the MFP institution. It is for this reason that he is thankful to those who make possible this financing that will help him to meet his goals. On his part, he comments that he feels comfortable in his communal bank, since he knows its members and considers them responsible and united people. With the 1500 PEN he has applied for, he will buy some parts and make some repairs on his mototaxi, in addition to regularizing his documents, since they are about to

Tiene un peque\u00f1o puesto de venta en la vereda de su casa en donde pone a la venta diversos art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como arroz, sal, az\u00facar, aceite, huevos, diferentes verduras, tub\u00e9rculos y condimentos.

Complementa esta labor con el alquiler de 2 mototaxis propios y con la venta de ropa que ofrece quincenalmente en zonas alejadas de la ciudad.  Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que es muy relajado ya que no precisa ejercer ninguna funci\u00f3n que requiera esfuerzo, en el caso de venta de ropa la \u00fanica dificultad que encuentra son las largas horas de viaje que tiene que emprender hasta llegar a su destino.

She lives with her partner of many years and is a mother of four grown children. She and her partner live in her mother's home, along with 6 other people. She works a lot because she wants to give her family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nVilma sells groceries. She has a small stall on the sidewalk of her house where she sells diverse articles of basic necessity like rice, salt, sugar, oil, eggs, different vegetables, tubers and condiments. She has been doing this for more than two years. Her mother and sister help her. To complement this work, she owns 2 mototaxis that she rents out, and she also sells clothing semimonthly in far-away parts of the city. What she likes most about her work is that it's very relaxed since she doesn't have to do anything particularly difficult - in the case of selling clothing, the only difficulty is the long hours of travel that she needs to get to her destination. In spite of everything she is very calm because all of her work gives her the money she needs to cover her personal and familial expenses. \r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she thanks all the people that continue trusting in her so that she can get this new loan that will help her to increase her wok capital. She knows that once again she will have to be very responsible and, above all, punctual. She is happy to belong to the village bank because they are very united. \r\n\r\nWith the requested 1000 soles she will buy groceries and some clothing that she needs to continue her business, as well as to upholster one of her mototaxis that is in bad shape.

Sarsekhan farms and raises livestock as her family's main source of income.  She started this business four years ago with 10,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her hard work, Sarsekhan now has two milk cows and their offspring, and one horse.  Her monthly income from her business is about 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nSarsekhan also has 3.3 HA of land where she raises barley, potatoes, wheat, and clover, which serve as feed for her cattle.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Sarsekhan applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep, which she will fatten and sell.  Sarsekhan is planning to invest the income from her loan in the development of her business.  This year, she would like to perform a major remodel of her home.\r\n

kids. In order to secure her family\u2019s finances, she has been growing rice as a primary source of income while her husband catches fish to sell. Savoeurt has been in the business for 30 years, earning approximately KHR 37,000 per day and leaving around KHR 13,000 for her savings, after deducting daily expenses. Savoeurt now needs money to buy fertilizers and rice seeds to use in her farmland. Thus, she is leading a group of three to request a loan with VisionFund. Savoeurt is a fourth-cycle client with VisionFund while her two fellow group members are the first-time clients.

Each day, she earns approximately 16,000 KHR, but she is able to save only around 6,000 KHR, which is considered to be a very little amount of money in a six-member family. Due to unexpected climate change, which sometimes causes natural disasters that provides negative effect to her rice-farming business, she is now leading a group member, Pov, to request a loan of 600,000 KHR each. This will be the first loan for both of them with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. She will spend her loan portion to buy fertilizers and rice seeds to use in her rice field, to cover plowing fees, and to planting vegetables for extra income.

This year the ASC decided to farm a collective field for its member\/shareholders. Each member has his own plot of land which he farms. This activity allows them to provide for their needs as well as those of their respective families. The man in charge of the team (dressed in smart clothes) is a married man.

She received a previous 30,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase a greater quantity and variety of grocery items and products needed in her general store. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and for her personal, household, and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nNenita is requesting another 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her store inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. Nenita knows that more items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from her loan will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and provide for her children\u2019s education. Nenita looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. She hopes to grow her business and she dreams of being able to give her children a good, high quality education. Nenita faithfully meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Her husband is a vendor, and they have three children. She earns a living by buying and selling clothing, and gets her inventory from wholesalers and sells it on a retail basis to both men and women. Her customers like her low prices and wide inventory. Most of the people who buy her clothing are her neighbors, and she earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan for PHP 50,000. She will use the loan to buy more items to sell to her customers and to expand her inventory. By boosting her business, she expects this loan to increase her income. In coming years, she hopes to expand her business and draw her family closer to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from her religion.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 people who gather weekly to study religion, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, Julieta is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulieta hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMarneth hopes to be able to expand soon, and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He will incorporate his loan into his current revolving fund that he uses to buy materials. His profits from his business will definitely help him to sustain his daily needs.

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business of sewing women's clothing at home in 2009 with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to persistence and hard work, Asel's monthly business income amounts to 20,000 som (KGS), and the earnings allowed her to purchase a sewing machine and an iron.  In order to further develop her business, Asel requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase materials and thread.
