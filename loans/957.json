She buys and sells personal products by catalog: lotions, creams, cosmetics, and hair products, among other items. She has had her little business for a number of years, and it has given her a lot of experience in sales, which allows her to obtain better earnings. She makes her sales as a walking vendor and from her home, in all the surrounding areas of her district.\r\nShe has acquired a lot of customers, and she is well known and reliable, since everything she sells is of first quality and affordably priced. In addition, she provides excellent service. Irma is an energetic person, dedicated to her work. She likes to strive for what she wants, and for this reason she works very hard day after day, with much effort and with love for what she does, since she knows that only this way can she achieve success.

She began this business with only 5,000 Kyrgystan Som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Baktygul's farm now has 1 dairy cow and calf, and 5 head of sheep. Her farm brings in a monthly income of 15,000 Som.\r\n\r\nBaktygul approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 Kyrgystan Som for the purpose of developing her business.

She has a bakery where she sells all types of savory and sweet bread like cakes, turnovers, rolls and French bread, among others.  She\u2019s been in business for several years and has gained quite a bit of experience cooking.  She leases the space for the bakery and it\u2019s in a strategic location with many passersby.  She\u2019s acquired a large clientele who prefer her because of the quality, good prices and exceptional service; she\u2019s always at her customers\u2019 disposal.\r\n\r\nNancy is a woman who\u2019s dedicated to her work; she\u2019s active and very tenacious.  She works to the maximum degree every day to earn a better future for her and her family; they are the most important things in her life.\r\n\r\nLike all good merchants, Nancy wants to increase business because she knows that if she increases production, profits will increase too.  But to do so she needs capital which is why she\u2019s asked Integral for a loan to buy flour, sugar, yeast, sweetener, milk, eggs, etc.  Nancy Esmeralda has good payment references and is sure that she will be able to repay the loan while at the same time has faith that she will be able to bring economic security to her home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1192382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and raising two children.  Her husband earns a small salary.  This salary is not sufficient to provide the family with all of the necessities.  Fotima decided to help her husband in order to improve the family's welfare.  For this, she completed a course, called \"Achieve Success,\" organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  Now, she can organize her business and become successful in this field.  She wants to organize a business of sewing women's clothing because she has experience in this type of business.

He is married and has three children. Saleh has a permanent job in a sugar factory, where he works from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.. His salary as a general worker is too low to cover his family's needs. He comes to work to his shop after 2 p.m. Ten years ago he started to seek new options to make money and an idea about opening a mobile phone shop came into his mind. Now he is a successful entrepreneur and his monthly income is 400 AZN.  He hired his son as a salesman and now the mobile phone shop is considered the family business. His store is successful because he has a very good location in the central bazaar.

married and has two children.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 20 years, having started this business with 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kalybu's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and three horses, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 17,000 som (KGS).  She also works on three hectares of land, growing clover, used for livestock feed, and vegetables - potatoes, pumpkins and onions.  In order to further develop her business, Kalybu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow in order to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business by buying additional livestock, so that she could hold a wedding for her youngest son upon his return from the

She has been involved in animal husbandry farming since 1996, having started this business practically with nothing.  Thanks to Bubinazira's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and 0.90 hectares of her own land and 1.0 hectare of leased land with watermelons, corn and cotton.  Thanks to the business earnings, she was able to hold a wedding for her son and prepare a dowry for her daughter.

They live together in a house they rent with one of their nieces and her sister. Susana's business sells motorcycle lubricants. She has a store set up in a space she rents. All of her merchandise is brought from the city and she sells it at competitive prices. She has been able to earn her customers' preference and they recommend her to other people, which increases her customer base and makes her store a very busy location.\r\n\r\nShe started out over two years ago. It was her partner's idea and she had her own capital, but he supported her by tending to the business in his time off.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business is quite profitable because there is high demand for her products, her prices are fair, and the total vehicle stock is on the rise as well. \r\n\r\nBefore she started her business she didn't have her own income, wich is why she decided to find work and generate her own financial earnings. That would also allow her to help her partner realize their plans of buying a home. So in light of the positive results, in the future she would like to increase her amount of merchandise and expand by selling motorcycle spare parts. This is her 13th loan with the institution MFP, so she can count on their cooperation in order for her to carry out her plans. On the other hand, she once again promises to pay her installments as she did with previous loans. She also enjoys being a part of her communal bank because all of its members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles in the purchase of wholesale lubricants so that she has stock available for sale.

adem\u00e1s de ser alegre y cordial en su trato con las personas. Est\u00e1 casada con M\u00e1ximo quien es comerciante y padre de sus hijos quienes ya son mayores e independientes. Juntos habitan c\u00f3modamente su propia casa. La actividad que realiza Julia es la comercializaci\u00f3n de abarrotes, art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda, medicamentos y otros, para esto abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en su propia casa, desde donde atiende las necesidades de sus vecinos, quienes son sus principales clientes, a los que atiende muy amablemente. Tambi\u00e9n vende golosinas y bebidas gasificadas en su bodega.\nSe inici\u00f3 hace m\u00e1s de 8 a\u00f1os logrando hacerse muy conocida por las zonas que oferta sus productos y hasta el momento lo viene realizando sola.\nConsidera su negocio rentable porque casi siempre acaba todo lo que lleva para vender, dej\u00e1ndole buenas ganancias. Antes de empezar con su negocio ten\u00eda dificultades econ\u00f3micas ya que los alimentos suben  de precios constantemente y los ingresos de su esposo no les alcanzaban para cubrir todos sus gastos, por eso quiso apoyarlo gener\u00e1ndose sus propios ingresos econ\u00f3micos.\nPor tanto, viendo lo bien que le resulta su negocio, desea continuar y mantenerlo. Este es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 13 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Por tanto cuenta con  un peque\u00f1o pr\u00e9stamo para que pueda cumplir con sus objetivos. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s de cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9dito que tuvo. Tambi\u00e9n comenta que se siente a gusto con banco comunal pues lo considera un grupo unido y solidario.\nCon el monto solicitado de 1200 nuevos soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en su negocio comprando abarrotes en general como arroz, az\u00facar, aceites, entre otros, y golosinas, buscando aumentar su capital con las ganancias de las ventas, por eso espera conseguir precios c\u00f3modos por sus compras en volumen.\n\n","en":"Julia, 63, is a hardworking, enterprising woman besides being cheerful and treating others kindly.  She\u2019s married to M\u00e1ximo who is a merchant and the father of their children who are all independent adults now.  They all live comfortably in their own house.  \r\n \r\nJulia\u2019s activity is selling groceries, stationery supplies, medicine and others.  To do so, she opened a small home-based store where she tends to her neighbors\u2019 needs who are her main customers and who she tends to kindly.  She also sells sweets and carbonated beverages in her store.  She started more than 8 years ago and has succeeded in making herself very well-known in the areas because of her product offerings; to date she\u2019s been working alone.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because she almost always sells out everything she brings to sell earning good profits.  Before starting her business she had economic difficulties because the price of food constantly rises and her husband\u2019s income was insufficient to cover all expenses and that\u2019s why she wanted to help him by earning income of her own.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, seeing the good results her business has, she wants to continue and keep it in operation.  This will be MFP loan #13 so she now has a small loan to be able to reach her objectives.  She commits once more to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with her previous loans.  She also comments that she feels comfortable in her communal bank because she considers it to be a united, supportive group.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1200 new soles to invest in her business buying groceries in general like rice, sugar and oil, among others and also sweets hoping to increase her capital though profits from sales.  She therefore hopes to get good prices because of her volume purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1192512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"  to buy rice, sugar, oil and sweets, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-18T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-18T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":191.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":205.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":217.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.77,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452388},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":191.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":197.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447578},{"amount":75.45,"local_amount":190.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":196.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053476},{"amount":81.37,"local_amount":205.57,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":212.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188414},{"amount":84.4,"local_amount":213.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":220.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572333},{"amount":86.28,"local_amount":217.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":225.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121996}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T09:11:33Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":472236,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Emma works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from charcoal retail.

As a hardworking young man, Ever's main dream is to get ahead and create a better future for himself. He makes a living as a taxi driver transporting passengers between districts. The commute usually takes half an hour, so Ever likes to make sure his passengers are comfortable during the ride by playing music or chatting with them. He has been working as a taxi driver for five years now (since he was 19), and he really enjoys his work. Thanks to his parents and money he had worked to save, Ever was able to buy his own car for transporting his passengers. Typically, during the evening hours (between 8:00 and 9:00 at night), there aren't many passengers looking for a ride, so Ever often has to wait longer to make trips with even two customers. Sometimes, he has to wait until the next day to continue working.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 nuevos soles of support from this, his first loan, Ever plans to purchase replacement parts for his car, so that he can continue with his taxi business. His dream is to eventually buy another vehicle to expand his operation. He is very grateful for the support he has received, and promises to make all scheduled repayments on time and make an effort to get to know his fellow group members.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1192533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase replacement parts for his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-18T23:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-18T23:00:15Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ever ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529106}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T09:25:28Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":471092,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Luisa, ella se dedica a su actividad comercial que es la compra y venta de Artesan\u00edas, principalmente de elementos y joyas en plata y cer\u00e1mica, productos que comercializa en uno de los principales mercados artesanales y tur\u00edsticos de la ciudad.

Most of all she is highly motivated to get ahead.  From the time she was very young, she learned what it is to earn her living by the sweat of her brow, since  her parents came from a very humble background.  At times what they earned was not enough to support the household, so she worked in order to help them.  She lives in the city of Chincha, which is characterized by its warm climate and friendly atmosphere.  There are beautiful beaches, and the local people have a gift for making delicious dishes.  \r\n\r\nWhen she has some free time, Milagros very much likes to read, and sometimes she enjoys one of her favorite dishes \u201cPollo a la Braza\u201d (barbecued chicken with French fries).\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of enthusiasm, she works as a secretary in a city institution.   She works for around nine hours per day, and in the evenings she uses her earnings to finance her studies.  She is pursuing a career as a lawyer.  She believes that things are going well in her work because she is highly motivated to succeed, and above all she is very responsible.\r\n\r\nMilagros is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help she will be able to cover her educational expenses, such as registration fees, monthly tuition, textbooks, school supplies and other items.  In this way she will have the tools necessary to continue studying and will be able to make her greatest dream a reality: \"to have a good professional career and be the pride of her parents\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1191041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He has 23 years' worth of experience in repairing and painting vehicles. He learned this trade because he started working in an auto repair shop as an assistant, since he was very young and unfamiliar with it. However, later on he learned the business very well and set up his own shop where he employs young people who wish to learn the trade.\r\nThe loan he requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase eight gallons of putty, two gallons of paint, electrodes, saws, discs, among other items. With the loan Don Juan will be able to buy the supplies in bulk, so that he can get more accessible prices. He'll also save time by not having to travel so often to the town where he buys the supplies. Besides, with the supplies in his shop Don Juan will be able to tackle any job that comes in, because he'll have the supplies to do it. His goal is to build a larger shop and get protection from the

Cambodia. She is a 32-year-old mother of two children, both of whom are dependent on her and still in school. She has been farming rice for eight years to support her family and also supplements the family\u2019s income by selling desserts in the local area. Her current business earns her around 32,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day, which she uses to meet her family's needs. The main challenge for her field business is low crop yields.\r\n\r\nSopheap has been with VisionFund for one cycle, while the other member has been with VisionFund for four cycles.

Lucita is married to Rodeo and a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. At this time, Lucita is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLucita maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-sales brands such as Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. In direct selling, the dealer buys the customer's order in cash and then gives it to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, hence the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Lucita also has a tailoring business making pillow cases and bed sheets. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers and expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLucita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family.

canteen of a local school. Since 1996, she has been growing crops and raising livestock as a means of supplementing her salary. She started this business with only 6,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Thanks to her persistent hard work, Seinebpu now has 2 dairy cows, 2 calves, 12 sheep and 4 goats. She also has 1.6 hectares of land where she grows corn, clover and wheat. The income Seinebpu has earned has allowed her to pay to send her son to the capital city for his studies. \r\n\r\nSeinebpu approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to develop her business. She will use the money to purchase young livestock to fatten and re-sell. Seinebpu plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest in her business. She wants to buy more cattle in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1197993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uch -Terek village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":60.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seinepbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10081.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754788},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15122.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862935},{"amount":508.69,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25203.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.81,"payment_id":459019304},{"amount":426.65,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20162.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.35,"payment_id":490749281},{"amount":616.79,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30244.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.21,"payment_id":529946686}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T01:09:53Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":472299,"name":"Gilbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gilbert runs a video show business to earn a living.

Among her six kids, she can afford to keep two daughters in school while the remaining four help the family business. They also produce sugar from sugar palm trees in order to assist their mother (Heak) with their basic daily needs. \r\n\r\nHeak and her husband manage their two-hectare (about 20,000 square meters) of farmland for rice crop cultivation to help their big family survive. Heak has been involved in this business for 25 years and earns about 26000 KHR. Her main challenges are water supply shortages and insufficiency of working capital to support her rice farm, especially the cost of harvesting fees. Therefore, Heak formed a group of two women to seek a new loan; she is in the third cycle while her co-member is in the second cycle with Kiva's partner.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully repaying a loan, Heak feels confident that she can sustain her family's living condition as well as her business. For this cycle, she and her fellow group member are seeking the same loan amount: 1000000 KHR each. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to pay a harvesting fee and buy fertilizer for her rice field. She hopes to gain more yield and sell at a higher price so she can keep her children in school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1194603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay a harvesting fee and buy fertilizer for her rice field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T04:30:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1014250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265936},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1014250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837829}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T19:42:34Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Rosetty","image":1201942}},{"id":472303,"name":"Margaret   Wanjiru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 60 years old and is married with four children.

As a result, she can buy chickens and pigs to raise for extra income.\r\n\r\nIn order to boost her yield and keep making good progress with her business, Chreb formed a group of three women to seek a new loan. Chreb is seeking 800,000 KHR, while her two fellow members are applying for 1,000,000 KHR each. As the group leader, Chreb will use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer to boost her yield.
