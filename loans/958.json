This work allows her to earn an income to support her family, since she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she likes the health area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1192649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T06:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T06:10:01Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7777.77,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1287},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1298.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":186.16,"local_amount":1287,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260903},{"amount":187.76,"local_amount":1298.14,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490620},{"amount":187.77,"local_amount":1298.14,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095479},{"amount":187.77,"local_amount":1298.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235554},{"amount":187.76,"local_amount":1298.14,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617389},{"amount":187.78,"local_amount":1298.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347171985}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T11:26:24Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":472311,"name":"Janet   Wambui","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a hardworking business lady and the mother of two children who are in school.

He has experience as a driver, because he needed to drive cars and trucks in the countryside. He has since moved, with his parents, to the center of the province. \r\n\r\nNow he plans to his open a transportation business and he has decided to purchase a truck. In Mongolia it is possible to buy a truck for 7,000,000 MNT. He has sold his livestock for 4,000,000 MNT, but he still needs a 3,000,000 MNT loan to purchase the truck.

It has been 10 years since she has engaged in this business, and it earns her about KHR 25,000 per day. For Nhean, the main challenge for her business is low crop production due to the unpredictable weather issue, pests, and the declining price of corn. The past loan was her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). After the successful loan that has sustained a good living condition for her especially in providing decent food for her children, she has paid back the entire loan. Now, she is a leader in a group of two female members. She and her co-member are seeking the same loan amount of KHR 1,000,000 each. For her loan portion, she will use it to buy seeds, fertilizer, and insecticides for her crops. She expects a larger yield and to receive a high profit so as she can keep supporting all of her children in

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 27,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She buys her mobile phone credit from the phone operators on average twice a week; however, as the demand for the credit is always increasing, she has trouble meeting all her customers' requests. This is because her working capital is insufficient to allow her to restock quickly enough; which causes her to be frequently out of stock, and to progressively lose her customer base.\r\nTherefore, she is seeking this loan in order to be able to increase her purchase of mobile phone credit, cigarettes and candy - this will allow her to retain and grow her customer base, and as a result, her profits. These profits will be invested back into the shop in order to grow it, but some will also be used to cover the family's living expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1198352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call

The group has eight members, headed by a board.  Virginia is the president of the board.  The members operate a range of businesses that include: plastic sales; food sales; a corner grocery; tailoring services; general crafts; sewing businesses; and hairdressing services.\r\n\r\nThe loan will support small businesses.  Virginia tells us that she joined Pro Mujer three years ago, after receiving an invitation to join from a friend.  She has a food business now.  She helped her aunt start the business and joined in to operate it later.  \r\n \r\nVirginia will use the loan to buy the ingredients she needs (flour) to continue the business.

Ella sale a ofrecer sus productos a las diferentes pulper\u00edas y supermercados , pero necesita trabajar con m\u00e1quinas que le ayuden a agilizar m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido sus  pedidos  , es por ello que est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar una batidora grande para mezclar mayor cantidad de mezclas y elaborar m\u00e1s unidades de pan y cumplir con los pedidos pendientes. Pues su sue\u00f1o es ir comprando maquinaria nueva para hacer pan y mejorar la calidad de su producto que le permita tener mayor clientela y solidez en su negocio.   \n","en":"Norma is from Somoto, one of the most touristic municipalities in Estel\u00ed.  It is known for its picturesque scenery and delicious \u2018rosquillas\u2019 [a ring-shaped pastry], which are made with corn and cheese.\r\n\r\nNorma is married, an accountant by profession, and she has three children.  In spite of the fact that she managed to study accounting, she decided to use her knowledge by establishing her own bakery business.   Even though her first experience with business was working in a mini supermarket when she was 34, she decided to stop working there when they tried to rob the business, which she looked after by herself.\r\n\r\nThat is when she took a bakery course and started to sell, by herself, the bread she made with her own hands.  She goes to different grocery stores and supermarkets to offer her different products.  However, she needs to work with machines that help her fill her orders more quickly.\r\n\r\nThat is why she is requesting the loan to buy a large mixer in order to mix larger quantities of dough, to make more loaves of bread, and to fill pending orders.  Her dream is to gradually buy new machinery in order to improve the quality of her product.  This will allow her to have more customers and solidify her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1192693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

He used to work in agriculture, but his income as a farmer was not enough to support his family, who number seven in total.  After much thought about how to support his family so his children wouldn't go hungry, Inhomjon decided to sell his only dairy cow and to apply for a loan from our organization.  With this money, he bought a car - an Opel Astra - and he currently works as a taxi driver.  At first, the work was very tiring, but he now finds that it suits him.

Cambodia. She is a 28-year-old married mother of three children. To make a living, Somyan has been farming rice on three hectares of farmland for ten years, while her husband is a taxi driver to help the family generate extra income. The current business earns them about 18,000 KHR per day and they manage to save about 8,000 KHR for future needs. Lacking the capital to support her paddy-rice is the main challenge for her business. \r\n\r\nSomyan\u2019s group consists of two members who live in the same village, and this is the fifth loan for her group with VisionFund.

She will use the 2,000 new soles to buy lumber to make furniture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1193302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529117}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T22:22:34Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":471556,"name":"Leyda Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Leyda Mar\u00eda  trabaja  en un colegio de la Ciudad de Le\u00f3n desempe\u00f1ando el cargo de docente  Leyla Mar\u00eda sale de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n 6:30 inicia sus labores 6:45 am  finalizando  a las 12:00 pm  con este mismo horario de lunes a viernes,   Por la tarde  dedica dos hora para la planificaci\u00f3n de la clase del d\u00eda siguiente,  Leyda Mar\u00eda es  madre de dos  hijos de 7 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad. \n\nLeyda  solicita un cr\u00e9dito a Ceprodel  el que  utilizara  para compra de uniforme de su hija que participara en el desfile  de la fiesta patria como integrante de la comparsa r\u00edtmica del colegio en que estudia  y uniforme de su Hijo var\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n participara en el desfile.","en":"Leyda Mar\u00eda is a young woman who works as a teacher in a school in the city of Le\u00f3n.

His shop is located at home and he works there in the afternoon.  He\u2019s been in business five years and his nephew helps him with the technical tasks.  On the other hand, he also works buying and selling lumber.  He\u2019s been doing this for ten years and does this work in the morning with help from three laborers.  He buys every ten or fifteen days and works especially with lumber of the \u201clupuna\u201d species that he ships to other cities where it\u2019s in high demand.  He also owns a mototaxi that he drives occasionally through the city streets to generate more income for his family.  He is very happy because both activities are having good results thanks to the good clientele he\u2019s managed to consolidate as time has gone by.  He hopes to continue working like he\u2019s done to date so that later on he can open a carpentry shop or a regional lumber sales business.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #17.  He thanks all those people who continue trusting in him so that he can access financing again that will help him increase his working capital.  He knows that he will have to be very responsible and above all punctual once more.  He\u2019s happy to belong to his communal bank because he sees that all the members are very supportive.  He will use the requested 3,000 soles to increase capital to buy larger amounts of lumber; his bi-weekly expenditure can hover around 1,500 soles.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1193415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber

He comes from Chinandega, in the municipality of Posoltega, which is located in the western part of the country.

Four of his children are dependents, as they are students and still minors.\r\n\r\nHis business, which he has been running for 25 years, is itinerant.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, he was not able to pursue a university education and has therefore had to fight hard for his children to have better opportunities.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Anastasio's routine is to get up at 4:00am every day to begin his journey to regions that are both nearby and far away to buy live hogs and resell them to butchers who will then sell the meat.  He goes about this activity using a wagon pulled by horses, which he owns.  He travels in the same wagon with the hogs.\r\n\r\nHe needs the financing in order to invest in the purchase of hogs to offer his established and new customers.  Jos\u00e9 Anastasio is grateful to the Kiva investors for their help and opportunities for a dignified life that they offer the small vendors with few resources living in poor countries like Nicaragua.

She is single and has four children with whom she shares her home which she built with her ex while they were living together.  Day after day, they struggle to get ahead and improve their quality of life.  Mar\u00eda begins working very early, purchasing the various regional fruits like papayas, bananas, oranges and other products which she acquires from the main market in the city where she lives.  She makes her sales out of her home; she has a large table set up where she displays all of the products that she sells for the satisfaction of her customers.  Eventually, she makes jams with the fruits that are very ripe and then she also sells them.  Her home is located in a well traveled area and this allows her to have very good sales on a daily basis.  She has worked over four years at this and she generally works by herself, although sometimes she receives help from her children.  She supplements this business with the sale of soft drinks and ice cream, the profits from which help her to bear the household expenses.  She enjoys her work because it allows her to complete tasks that don't require great effort.  Moreover, it permits her to have the necessary free time in the afternoons to complete other tasks which also provide income.  She hopes to expand her business.  She has the willpower and the desire to be able to supersede her own expectations.  This is her third loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that there exist people who offer financial support that will allow her to be more calm and advance with her business plan.  Moreover, she promises to make her payments punctually and above all, to empathize with the other members of her communal bank who are very supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the amount of 1000 soles requested, she will purchase more fruits to add to her business, as well as yucca and plantains, since they are products with a high demand from her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1193459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more fruit, yucca, and plantains.

He is 35 years old and lives with his common-law wife and two children.  He is a mechanic who has had his own business for five years.  When he was a child he worked alongside his father, who was the owner of an auto repair garage.  His father taught the business to him and his brothers.  Guillermo was the one who liked this business most of all, and as time passed he decided to open his own home-based business, supported by one brother whom he pays for his work.\r\n\r\nHe does not have any other sources of income to support his family and his household, only the income that comes from this business.  For this reason he is seeking a Kiva loan in order to buy spare parts such as spark plugs, carbon brushes, ball-bearings, nuts and light bulbs that are necessary for him to do his job.  This loan will help him to grow his business and begin selling parts in addition to performing repairs.  This will allow him to obtain more regular customers and better earnings.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to expand his working space and dedicate an area to the sale of parts, which will allow him to have a successful shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1193437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts such as spark plugs, carbon brushes, ball-bearings, nuts and light bulbs.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gullermo Ramon \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":421.52,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":46.84,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":47.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443947},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":46.84,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":47.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048893},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":46.84,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":47.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006048},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":46.84,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":47.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568819},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":46.84,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":47.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118444},{"amount":47.82,"local_amount":47.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":47.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531062},{"amount":98.32,"local_amount":97.51,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":98.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573025},{"amount":42.73,"local_amount":42.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165764}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T20:33:00Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":467011,"name":"Alida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alida tiene 25 a\u00f1os, su pareja es Percy, con quien tiene tres hijos: Mar\u00eda Fernanda de 5, Edith de 4 y Yamile de un a\u00f1o.

She works alone from 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m. She is the single mother of one nine-year-old son.

He is married and raising one child, who is nine months old.  He grew up in a poor family.  His father worked at a collective farm, and mother stayed home and raised children.  Umidjon went to school until the ninth grade.  After completing ninth grade, he started working as a loader.  He started his own business in animal husbandry eight years ago.  He has a large garden, where he grows hay for the livestock.  He sells milk to his neighbors, who are very happy with the natural milk product.

She is a good, hard working woman. She has been married to Albertano for many years. She lives in her own home with her husband and her grand daughter who is 14 years old, to whom she provides for all her needs and tries to give her a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nMercedes has a business selling coal. She runs the business out of her home. She has a table set up where she puts the bags of coal, which previously she has portioned out into smaller bags. Initially she purchased wholesale, buying sacks that could make more than 50 small bags, which she then sold. She buys approximately 5 sacks a week, investing around 100 soles in each purchase. She has had this business for more than 4 years and it is going very well. Along with this business, she also sometimes sells local products like plantains and lemons. Her grand daughter helps her with the business, and also sometimes her husband. She likes her work because she is able to make her own income from the comfort of her own home, and also be able to do the chores that need to be done around the house. She has learned how to keep a balance between her business and taking care of the house. However, she is still not satisfied with her economic situation, which is why she wants to start a new business selling fruit. She already has a location to sell from, located in the downtown area of the city. She wants to sell the most tasty and delicious of the region and of the country, and in this way hopes to increase her income. This is the sixth loan she has taken out through MFP. She is thankful to the people who make these loans possible, which help her to reach her goals. She also said that she feels content with her community bank, because she knows the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.    \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 2000 soles, Mercedes will buy 5 sacks of coal and a few bunches of bananas to sell during this time, the rest of the loan she will invest in the purchase of various tropical fruits like grapes, apples, pears, custard apples, oranges, watermelons and others to start her new business with. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1193469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy 5 sacks of coal and various fruits.

She is a joyful woman and full of life. She is married to Ulises and has five adult children. She lives in the house she owns with her husband, their daughter, and their two grandchildren. She is raising them very lovingly and wants to provide them with the best quality of life so that they have a future with no financial problems. \r\n\r\nLourdes' work is selling sweets. She has a display case at home where she offers the public cookies, gum, candy, and other products that her customers ask for, such as small snacks. She has been in this business for five months and combines it with selling food. She has some tables and chairs that she puts out on the sidewalk in front of her house daily. Her children and grandchildren help her set them up on schedule and occasionally they help her tend to the customers while she cooks some of the meat, fish, and plantains she uses to make the dishes she sells. She has been in this business for two years, and during this time she has honed her cooking skills and improved her customer service. She likes her job because it allows her to stay physically active and, at the same time, generate financial income to cover home expenses.

started her partnership with our organization in 2011.  She sews \"kurpachi\" or national mattresses at home.  Her mother taught her this business, and now Rahbar continues it herself and helps her mother to make \"kurpachi.\"  Rahbar also works as a waitress at a restaurant.  She tries to earn more because her children grew up, and she needs to get ready for them to start a university and save money for her son's and daughter's weddings.  Rahbar has four children, and her husband works hard as well.  She wants to obtain this loan to purchase cotton in order to make national mattresses.  According to our traditions, when a daughter gets married, her dowry must include national mattresses.  Currently, it is the season when everyone is getting ready for weddings and order these kurpachi (national mattresses) from Rahbar.

He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 16 years. He will use his loan to support labor costs and fertilizer purchases during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With the profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo, taken recently at another maize farming plantation, shows him very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

It is Fortune\u2019s long-term goal to bring about change to address this pressing social issue.\n\nFortune identified and addressed a need in his community when he noticed the unpleasant surroundings of the local hospital near his boarding school. Fortune felt the need to improve the area as it had become a breeding ground for mosquitos and snakes. He appealed to his fellow classmates to help the hospital personnel tidy up the surroundings of the hospital. He managed to mobilize a group of students to pick up papers and cut the long grass around the hospital \u2013 efforts that were recognized by the nurse in charge of the hospital.   This is now an on-going project.\n\nA natural leader, Fortune has held multiple leadership positions. In Zimbabwe, leadership roles he assumed included: Sports Commissioner (co-ordinating sporting activities at his school), a junior leader at his church, the chairman for Kutama Cricket Fund-Raising Committee, and  duty-boy at his school (waking up earlier than the others to ensure that everyone woke up on time and issuing cleaning materials for students who needed to use them). In addition to the numerous leadership positions he held, Fortune was still able to excel academically and was even named the best student in Economics in his high school in Zimbabwe. \u201cA good leader needs to manage their time well,\u201d says Fortune.\n\nAn aspiring businessman, Fortune\u2019s entrepreneurial flair was recognised by pan-African bank, Ecobank, when he submitted a business plan to the bank for a business competition. Ecobank praised Fortune for his entrepreneurial ability and acknowledged that they were interested in supporting his plan so that he could execute it in the future.\n\nIn twenty years\u2019 time, Fortune sees himself as a large-scale social entrepreneur in Africa. He wants to build businesses that provide services that will seek to address the problems that the continent will be facing at that time.  He wants to partner with other people who are passionate about developing the continent to maximize the impact of their work and contributions to the continent. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1199520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":" to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortune","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748408},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735291},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614224},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629748},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668058},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159795}],"funded_date":"2012-09-20T01:18:10Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":472567,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is the woman preparing fufu.

pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nShe was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nSinesipho is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nSinesipho is from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and her leadership journey began when she was very young. After losing both of her parents at a very young age, Sinesipho decided to start a support group for girls who had been in similar situations. Despite the hardships she has suffered, Sinesipho was able to use her experience to positively impact the lives of others. She served on the support group as chairperson and met with the group of girls every day after school to provide them with an avenue to talk about their problems and to see beyond the challenges they were facing.  \n \nSinesipho was involved in several extra-curricular activities at her school and even served as the speaker of the Debate Society. Academically, Sinesipho is also a high achiever. She was consistently ranked among the top ten students in her grade. \n\nSinesipho\u2019s passion lies in journalism and drama. She has written poetry for which she has won several awards.  She was also cast as the main character in a short film called \u201cWhen the Truth Comes Out.\u201d During the World Cup in South Africa, Sinesipho received a wonderful opportunity to intern as a writer for ESPN and Global Girls Media in Johannesburg. Through this experience, her keen interest in journalism and drama was cemented.\n\nSinesipho is a born leader who shows an outstanding ability to lead herself and others, and she stands up for what she believes in despite what other people may think. A prime example of this was when her school didn\u2019t have a life sciences teacher and Sinesipho went out of her way to have the principal find a replacement.\n\nSinesipho is passionate about bringing change to Africa. She says that she wants to impact Africa by telling untold stories and giving people a voice through her journalism. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1199527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sinesipho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748409},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735292},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614225},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629749},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668059},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159796}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T23:32:34Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":471644,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She is 26 and married with two children. Her husband works in Russia, but his income does not let him provide for his family.\r\nNasiba raises animals, but her income is not sufficient to cover all expenses. In order to start a new business, she took an \"Achieve Success\" course offered by the Association of Women in Business and received a certificate.

Rasmita, a 24-year-old lady, lives with her husband, a daughter (age 3), father-in-law and mother-in-law. Rasmita makes and sells leaf plates to add some income to her family with the financial support of Mahashakti. She purchases sal leaves (one type of forest leaves) from the tribal peoples, then stitches leaf plates and sells to the wholesaler in the same village. Her husband sells silver utensils moving from village to village. He does this business from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. Although Rasmita is managing her family with the limited income from these two businesses, her family is facing lots of problems due to the lack of essential facilities like a toilet. \r\n\r\nIn rural India, including rural Odisha, 80% of diseases happen due to the use of polluted water. The data say only 7% of rural areas are covered by toilet facilities in Odisha and the national figure is only 22%. Rasmita says, after her marriage when she came to her husband\u2019s house, there was no toilet in their house. She faced many complicated and embarrassing situations due to outside defecation. In the rainy season, the situation is most horrible. So she is determined to provide a toilet facility for her family members and wants to construct a toilet by taking out a loan of 20,000 Indian rupees in two phases. By doing this, she feels that it will be a solace to her father-in-law and mother-in-law who are very old.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1194915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for the construction of a toilet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-20T11:03:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":472020,"name":"Luis Rigoberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis es un joven soltero de 25 a\u00f1os vive en Chunchi un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia de Chimborazo, de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador.

a better life and brighter future. With their prior careers and qualifications nearly inconsequential here in the US, they searched hard for employment opportunities and soon started working in the cleaning and construction clean-up business. After working ten years for other companies, starting from the bottom and working their way into managerial positions, they decided to start their own business, Genesis Clean Services.  \r\n\r\nNow, several years after opening, they have expanded their services, created jobs, and most importantly, taught their children about hard work and responsibility.  Overcoming language and cultural barriers, they embraced the opportunities presented to them and rallied around their family to bring those dreams of a more successful future to realization.  \r\n\r\nThey were recently offered an amazing business opportunity and are in need of financing to purchase a carpet cleaner to fulfill a new, large contract. The impact of this Kiva loan will ensure the stability and growth of their company for years to come.

She remembers one particular facial she received when she left feeling reenergized and beautiful. This experience inspired her to seek to provide this type of amazing service for others.  \r\n\r\nAlways interested in helping others with their health and self-esteem, this field allowed her to follow her passions every day. After receiving several certifications in order to provide a wide breadth of services to her customers, Leah began acting on her personal philosophy. While others in the profession might work solely to create beauty topically, Leah believes, \u201cBeautiful skin begins with healthy skin.\u201d  Dedicated to organic, non-chemical products and remedies, she cultivates beauty from the inside, utilizing a holistic, client-specific approach to her work.  \r\n\r\nLeah is looking for a small amount of financing to help promote her business at a local trade show as well as to purchase new beneficial products for her clients. This Kiva loan will bolster her presence and initiate growth for her business. Inspired every day by the happiness on the faces of her clients after receiving treatment, she is determined to reach even more people in her community and provide everybody with the opportunity to

Originally from Japan, Machiko grew up with the Japanese practice of cultivating intricately designed and beautifully cultivated orchid plants. Although orchids are very common in Japan, they are unaffordable to most. However, during a visit to Hawaii over 30 years ago, she was surprised at how accessible orchids were and how easy they were to grow in Hawaii. It was during this time that she first began raising and cultivating orchids with the dream of sharing the beauty of Japanese orchids with everyone she met.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to the US, Machiko refined her orchid planting and cultivating skills. Orchids are among the most difficult flowers to grow and require the perfect balance of water, sun and nutrients to flower. The way Machiko tenderly cares for her orchids demonstrates not only her passion for her craft, but also her expertise in what she does.\r\n\r\nReady to expand her business and sell more orchids, Machiko will use her Kiva loan to build a shade for her plants, increase her planting area and also buy more flowers. She hopes to grow a larger, more beautiful orchid garden to attract more business and inspire people to fall in love with the flower she has loved all these years.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1191049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Despite her skill-set and education, she instantly faced challenges, coming to the harsh understanding that the business degree and experience she worked so hard to gain in her home country held no credibility here. With limited employment options, she soon started working as a waitress at the restaurant where her mother managed.  \r\n\r\nLike most immigrants, Bei had to rely on her family and community as she struggled to learn a foreign language and assimilate to a new culture, while also trying to figure out how to make her dreams a reality. She shared, \u201cI always had the support of my family, and I knew that if anything went wrong, they would always help me.\u201d \r\n\r\nBei eventually went to beauty school and received her esthetician and nail tech license in 2010. She started working at a nail salon with a close-knit group of immigrant estheticians who taught her the trade and helped polish her skills. During a visit back to China, Bei learned about reflexology, a type of acupuncture treatment for the feet that helps relieve stress and pain, and she decided to incorporate this practice into her treatments. \r\n\r\nCombining her experience in nail care and reflexology, Bei is now opening her very own salon that promotes both beauty and healthy living. She is seeking a $10,000 Kiva loan to set up her salon, purchase equipment, and install a pedi-chair.  \r\n\r\nAfter years of dedication and self determination, Bei has finally discovered her American Dream. Remembering all those who helped her along the way, Bei is looking to pay it forward. She has a strong desire to create employment opportunities similar to those given to her during the course of her challenging, yet rewarding journey.

She is married to Benjamin and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDaisy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDaisy hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work.
