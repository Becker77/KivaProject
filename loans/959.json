Low crop yields resulting from floods is the main challenge for her field business.\r\n\r\nBa has been with VisionFund for five cycles while the other member is new to VisionFund. The past loans have helped to better support the family by having sufficient food to eat. Now she is leading her group of two to request a loan from VisionFund. As the leader, Ba will use her portion to buy fertilizer and seeds for her farmland and use a portion of it to spend on labor fees.

","en":"Ikrom is 36 years old, married, and has 2 children at home. \r\n\r\nWhen Ikrom was still a schoolboy, as the oldest child in his family he was expected to help his father take care of the cattle. Ikrom dreamed of becoming a doctor, but his family's circumstances were such that he couldn't leave for the capital city to enter a medical training institute.

To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1982, having started this business with a purchase of sheep.

years old.  To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2000, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som.  Thanks to Natalya's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring, one bull and seven pigs, and the monthly income amounts to 5,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Natalya requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy three bulls and ten piglets for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to purchase a car to transport meat and milk products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1198238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three bulls and ten piglets for fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":853.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1921.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2775,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":130769.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743604}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T00:12:28Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":472917,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine, 28, lives with her long-term partner and her two children.

She is married and has five children, four of whom are in school. She owns a grocery store which she has been operating for three years. In this business, Zawadi sells greens, flour, cooking oil etc.\r\nZawadi learnt about Milango through a friend, with the aim of accessing credit to improve the business operations.

She lives with her husband Edgar.  They have five children who they care for in the house that she inherited from her mother five years ago.  Victoria is an industrious woman who works with her husband to care for their livestock.  They own several bulls, cows, and sheep.  However, her main source of income is producing traditional embroidered skirts of different colors and textures.  She sells her products to different merchants who come to her house to buy them.  Victoria says that she sells more skirts and receives more orders during the festival seasons, such as the upcoming \u201cEl Santiago\u201d, which is a festival that is held in honor of the animals.  She is now working very hard this season in order to generate more income.  \u201cI hope to take full advantage of this time so that I can earn the most income,\u201d Victoria says happily.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the second loan she has received from MFP.  Victoria is grateful for the support that has been provided because she can continue investing toward the progress of her business.  In addition, she promises to be punctual with her loan payments.  She will invest the money she requested in the purchase of fabrics for her embroideries.  If there is money left over, she will also buy livestock.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1187242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics for making embroideries and acquire livestock with any leftover funds.

His monthly income is 220 AZN and this business is only one source of financial income in his family. Beef is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.

It is called this because there is a mango tree in front of the house of the representative.  They noticed this and used it for the name of the group.  Maxima is a member of the group.  The other members, Lucila and Maria del Rosario, both live in a place called General Sandino.\r\nLucila was interviewed this time.  She is a housewife.  She is married to Rosendo, and they have three daughters who are her responsibility.  They are in elementary school and high school.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to her business activity in order to support her husband, whom she married very young.  She works to be able to get income for her household.  Her parents did not support them with anything to start their married life.  \r\n\r\nThat is why they decided to start working with coffee, corn, and bean crops.  She thanks God that the crops went well for them.  Years later her father decided to support her, and he gave them a little money, which they invested in raising pigs to later sell live.\r\n\r\nWhat she wishes from her business activity is to continue working on her land harvesting corn and beans.  She wants this in order to save the income she will be getting and to support her children who are in school.  She wants them to make something of themselves.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1185502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for purchasing and selling coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-20T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-20T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1182.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1248.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1296.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1421.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1487.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.38,"local_amount":1182.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407703},{"amount":97.52,"local_amount":1248.23,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392137},{"amount":101.28,"local_amount":1296.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120000},{"amount":106.55,"local_amount":1363.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068048},{"amount":113.41,"local_amount":1451.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1473.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284795},{"amount":113.86,"local_amount":1457.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199120}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T11:34:51Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":472981,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to hardship, Elizabeth and her husband hope to earn sufficient income to satisfy their needs.

Thanks to Aishakhon's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and five sheep, and the monthly income amounts to about 15,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Aishakhon requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.

Thanks to Cholpon's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring and eight sheep, and the monthly income amounts to about 7,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Cholpon requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.

She says that they gave their group that name because that's what they call their community; they decided to name the group after their community so that they wouldn't forget the name.\r\n\r\nAlicia has been with the group for several cycles. She says that although she has had various problems\u2014in the last cycle, two of her fellow members fell behind on their payments\u2014she is continuing with the group because she knows that they are very responsible, they are people who really invest their loans in their businesses and are able to pay back their loans, and they mutually support one another.\r\n\r\nAlicia says that she and her husband have a business that makes cinder blocks and bricks and sells gravel and sand. She says that she started this business with her husband more than seven years ago because her husband was working in construction in another country; when he arrived in Mexico, they decided to start their own business and provide for their family that way. She says that they have special machines for making cinder blocks or bricks, which they sell by the thousand for construction. They also sell loads of gravel or sand or whatever their customer orders. She says that she likes their business because it pays well and because she can be available to her children since the business is run from their house. She says that she is requesting a loan from the lender to purchase cement, sand, and gravel, and to repair some of the machines that they use to make cinder blocks and bricks.

This is a very hard-working community and one of the top producers of poinsettias in the nation. Over six million flowers are produced every year. They are sold within the country and exported abroad, since there are several colors such as red, coral, white, and brown, and varieties like Prestige, Oreon Red, Maren, Marble Star, Monet, and Free White. This currently generates 624 permanent jobs and 328 seasonal jobs, 60% of which are for women.

Since sales are good, she has been able to keep the business going and that makes her very happy because it has allowed her to help her husband with home expenses. She and her husband also work growing poinsettias. They don't produce large quantities, but they make a profit. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase pigs and buy them food and vitamins, and also to purchase fertilizer for the flowers. She says she sells her pigs to different local butcher shops, since she has customers who buy the animals.

He lives with his wife and his two children in her old house, which is located in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity. They live in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHis house has some problems such as heat loss and damage to its roof, inside walls, etc. So he is planning to make repairs and insulation using rock wool, cement, and foam. As he thinks, his home will be warmer after the wall, roof insulation, and a new smart furnace are installed. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems, and to buy the cars that run on natural gas.

province, Cambodia. She is 28 years old and married, with three children, one of whom is in school and the other two are under school age. \r\n\r\nShe has been farming rice on one hectare of farmland.  Her husband also complements the family\u2019s income by making palm juice and working for others for a fee.

His wife milks the cows and produces cheese products. In addition, the family has a greenhouse where they grow different kinds of greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Nestor's family sells an average of 80 kilograms of cheese, 1500 kilograms of greens, and 1200 kilograms of vegetables per month. Nestor is a very hardworking person who has a great deal of experience in his work.\r\n\r\nNestor is requesting a loan to purchase building materials and expand his family's greenhouse. After the greenhouse has expanded, he will be able to sow more greens and vegetables and will be able to get a good harvest. This will significantly increase his family's income.

For the past year she has been working hard to manage her small business selling phone accessories. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Deborah has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more phone accessories such as chargers and batteries, and will help her to generate greater profits and improve her family\u2019s standard of living. She hopes that in the future she will be able to get her young siblings into a good school. \r\n\r\nDeborah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, son, and parents-in-law. Her parents-in-law have a retirement pension. The family\u2019s economic activities are two greenhouses where cucumbers and different kinds of greens are grown. Nana does all the relevant seasonal work to ensure a good harvest. In addition, she runs a small dairy farm and has 4 milk cows whose milk is used for cheese production. Her agricultural and dairy production is sold at the local open market.\r\n\r\nNana works hard to generate some savings and expand her agricultural business.

She is married to Miguel Angel and they have two children in elementary school.  She sells Mexican snacks, such as tacos dorados, enchiladas, pambazos, lunches, different flavored juices, soft drinks and cookies, through a co-op she runs at the school her children attends.  She says she has been in business for four years and enjoys the co-op activity because it allows her to be near her children.  She tells us that she arrives at school very early in the morning to prepare to lunch for the students and teachers who eat there.  Every day she goes to the wholesale market in the nearest town to buy fresh fruit and vegetables to make her delicious meals.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to expand her business and buy more sweets and refreshments to have a bit more variety.  She only works at the co-op in the morning because there is someone else there in the afternoon, but she wanted to be the person responsible for the business because it is hard work and people advised her to take it over because she is such a good cook.  Her goal is to open a small restaurant since she is servicing many people, and  hopefully she can make her dream come true one day.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda de la Luz, Mar\u00eda Luisa, Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica, Irma Mar\u00eda, Mario, Luz Mar\u00eda, Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Fanny Mercedes.

His dreams are to live comfortably and save with his partner. He became interested in and motivated to join Esperanza after he was encouraged by others in this group to be part of the program and start his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":1196377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy beef, pork and chicken.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-09-21T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-21T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edermiro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliasin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":164000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11309.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12785.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12987.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":13192.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":13401.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":13613.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":13828.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":14047.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14269.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":14495.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14725.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":14958.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":386.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":291.37,"local_amount":11309.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11363.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387535},{"amount":663.96,"local_amount":25772.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25894.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372079},{"amount":1035.82,"local_amount":40206.84,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":40396.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981019},{"amount":2233.85,"local_amount":86710.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87120.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331964919}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T10:16:37Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":473328,"name":"Me","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Me is 30 years old and married with 3 children.

Her dad, who loved antiques, taught her to always carry a magnet to decipher between brass and metal when shopping yard sales. As she recalls, \u201cWe could always buy good, used furniture, hats, pins and buckles.\u201d Christine would accompany her father at trade shows during her high school years. However, she never truly enjoyed any part of it. \u201cIt was horrible in high school, selling cowboy hats in the heat,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I found myself getting good buys at garage sales and found a booth at an indoor market.\u201d \r\n\r\nSeeing there was potential to make a profit, Christine decided to launch The Last Remains, a small, environmentally friendly business that refurbishes and sells antiques. \r\n \r\n\u201cEveryone throws something away, but we can take those throwaways and sell them.  For instance, at estate sales, I find old suitcases and then \u2018upscale\u2019 them as pet beds,\u201d she says.  Suitcases padded with baby blankets and with chair legs attached, are among her bestselling products. \u201cWe take another item like a burned-out light bulb, remove the filament, wash it out with water and salt, then create hanging flower baskets.\"\r\n\r\nChristine said she spends hours cleaning her finds and sells the new creations at an affordable price. Currently, she employs her boyfriend, who also works remodeling homes. When on the job, he obtains reusable items for crafts. For example, he brought a window frame that Christine used as a photo frame, and a screen door, which she spray-painted and uses to display earrings and accessories at shows. Christine gives new life to old items that others would have trashed.  Doing this helps cut down on discarded items that end up in landfills.\r\n\r\nChristine and her boyfriend are looking to hire a welder to make animal-shaped objects from old tools and other objects such as a wine racks made from horse shoes and wood. In the future, they plan to hire more employees to assist with working multiple flea markets on the weekends, but Christine\u2019s major plan is to open a store within the next five years. \r\n\r\nShe discovered Accion Texas Inc., where she applied and was approved for this loan, through the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) in Abilene. Christine says the loan will go a long way toward purchasing furniture, wood and new materials to immediately begin creating items. \r\n\r\nShe showcases many photos on her Facebook page at: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thelastremains and her website at http:\/\/thelastremains.webs.com. Her father passed away December 2011, but the encouragement and support Christine receives from customers keeps her motivated to continue her father\u2019s trade.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1195826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase furniture, wood and new materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"El Paso, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2012-09-21T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-21T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":636,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":99.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":105.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":108.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.22,"local_amount":99.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308337515},{"amount":106.84,"local_amount":104.54,"processed_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315305863},{"amount":108.14,"local_amount":105.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914547},{"amount":109.85,"local_amount":107.48,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":109.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331745373},{"amount":111.26,"local_amount":108.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T11:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":111.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340153432},{"amount":112.69,"local_amount":110.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":112.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346988994}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T16:35:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":473247,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 42-year-old Mohamed from Waterloo eastern area in Freetown.

Her husband\u2019s salary was not enough to be able to support their four children.  \r\n\r\nWithout much capital, but with great effort, Deyanira got her business ahead.

She is married and has one child who is currently in school. For the past two years, Joweria has been working hard to manage her food stall where she cooks and sells matooke, a Ugandan dish. \n\nTo help expand her business, Joweria has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more matooke for resale, and will help Joweria generate greater profits and pay her daughter's school fees. Joweria hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home on it. \n\nJoweria is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills
