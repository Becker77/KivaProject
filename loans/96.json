For his part, Jos\u00e9 contributes income from his job as a laborer in a cement factory where he has worked for two years.\r\n\r\nCyntia's family is still young and so they view their plans and dreams with hope and confidence.

Milly is a Muganda lady from Impala village, which is found in the Entebbe district. She is 34 years old and married with six children. Four of her children are going to school and the other two are still at home.\r\nBefore Milly joined Life in Africa she used to be a full time house wife and didn't have much to do. Life was really not so easy, having many children to take care of and also having to sustain the family. At the time, her husband was also facing some problems with his work that was on a contract basis, where sometimes the payments would be delayed.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilly is a creative wife and she was involved in making crafts on a small scale at her home, which she would sell in order to try to raise an income for the family. The income generated was not really enough to sustain the family bills and needs and as a result, Milly chose to search for work to sustain the family. After a little searching, Milly was able to find work with Life in Africa. She was one of the people on the Invisible Children bracelet project. This job was a great support in boosting the family's income, but life has to go on. Milly, as a member of Life in Africa, is very instrumental in the community; she is very good in making handcrafts and also at sharing her craft making knowledge with the other community members. She has good interpersonal skills and consistent conduct.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom the salary earned and her savings, Milly was able to make an investment in the form of building rental houses. She managed to build three single room tenant houses and currently two are occupied and the other one is still incomplete. The first two single room rental houses also still need plastering. Currently, Milly has been charging 50,000 Ugandan shillings per room for the two rooms and has been generating an income of 100,000 shillings. Milly is requesting a loan of 250,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD150) to enable her to finish her third house to acceptable housing standards and also to do the plastering on the other two rental houses. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMilly will employ one person for the work. After the completion of the third room and plastering, Milly plans to increase the rent for her houses from 50,000 shillings to 60,000 shillings and she is expecting a monthly income of 180,000 shillings. This will allow her to save enough money from the rentals to build two more rental houses. The two single rooms are going to be built over a long time. It's a long-term investment depending on the profits saved.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLOAN BUDGET\r\n<br><br>\r\nBuying cement (6 bags) for 120,000 shillings;\r\n<br><br>\r\nBuying sand with one trip for 70,000 shillings;\r\n<br><br>\r\nBuying water (50 jericans worth) for 5,000 shillings;\r\n<br><br>\r\nLabour costs 50,000 shillings;\r\n<br><br>\r\nContingency costs 5,000 shillings; \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis totals 250,000 shillings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":46394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Building","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nsimbiziwome-Bukoto Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":8,"posted_date":"2007-07-02T01:52:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-16T05:57:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-08-16T09:15:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43131},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-09-16T09:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55076},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T09:15:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67866},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:15:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82029},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97642},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116207},{"amount":18,"local_amount":18,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-17T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136018}],"funded_date":"2007-07-02T05:57:45Z","paid_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":17401,"name":"Rashad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"47-year-old Rashad lives in the Salyan region, Yenikand village.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":216277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T18:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T21:05:25Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970714},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886931},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436191},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130464},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027266},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613291},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010374},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232685},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664501},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105246}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T20:05:25Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":74769,"name":"D\u00e9lali","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e \u00e0 Kp\u00e9l\u00e9-El\u00e9, Madame Y.

Kholmirzo has been a livestock farmer. He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has 2 children whom he needs to support and give a proper education to. Kholmirzo has improved his financial situation because he has been able to wisely use the loans he has received from IMON International to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

One of the biggest attractions of her business is the reasonable prices she offers. Galina would like to receive a loan for 8,000 Grivnyas to purchase diversified merchandise for further retail sale. These funds will allow her to maintain an adequate amount of inventory on hand and easily update her product selection. \r\n<p>\r\nWe believe that this loan will continue to help her business be successful and provide much-needed income for Galina and her family. She is hoping to use some of her profits generated to take her family on a much-deserved vacation this summer. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":326259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To maintain her inventory and diversify her grocery offerings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Stryi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Galina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1142.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52972428},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63192315},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73620187},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T20:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87057968},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96972804},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.86,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103817813},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1142.84,"processed_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709946}],"funded_date":"2009-05-27T19:48:13Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:28:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":115729,"name":"Christian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio  CHRISTIAN, vive en la provincia D.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

the city parks of Kyrgyzstan. Our following creditor is very unique, because he creates pieces of art.\r\n\r\nBakytbek K., 42, is a member of this group. Being inspired by successful people and historical events, Bakytbek always felt comfortable expressing his emotions in clay. Sculptures have been his passion since early childhood, when he used to make figures from sand on the beach at Lake Issyk Kul. He tried working on monuments and plates with inscriptions, and realized he could turn his hobby into a business.\r\n\r\nTo Bakytbek\u2019s surprise, this business started developing at a high pace. Now he has orders almost every day and is quite busy. Seven years have brought good results. At this moment Bakytbek earns 7,000 monthly, which supports his wife and four children financially. The purpose of his applying for a loan is to purchase raw materials for accomplishing more orders from customers. Bakytbek is very thankful to lenders, because it gives him the opportunity to express his inner world and make a living through his favorite occupation.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She started to look around for a potential area for display. She was inspired to start a carenderia for more income, as a stepping stone to achieve her dream, which included owning a restaurant. In this way she can give jobs to unemployed neighbors, and most of all, she provide for the needs of her 2 kids. Hopefully her husband can have a welding shop, too.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sometimes she goes out to find customers to buy them, but usually her sales style is to sell to her friends and neighbors.  She does not have a fixed schedule for selling her merchandise because she goes out at all hours.

Kamoliddin launched this venture more than 20 years ago. \r\n\r\nHe is an experienced technician who always tries to introduce newer equipment for a quality outcome of his work. His serious and responsible business approach has helped his business grow over many years. \r\n\r\nKamoliddin is seeking a loan of $1,500 to purchase spare parts for the different vehicles he repairs in his workshop. A broader assortment of necessary parts will help Kamoliddin attract more customers to his venture; thus, increasing his monthly income. Kamoliddin is very serious about loan repayment. He has repaid previous loans without any delinquencies.  \r\n \r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He later divorced his wife and she went back to her hometown, leaving him with the children.\r\n\r\nHe works at a mine clearance company as a sapper, but he's also a salesman at Boane's central market. With the help of his children, he sells rice, sugar, flour, and other items, which brings them approximately 5.000,00MT (U$175) per month. At the mine clearance company he makes about 1.650,00MT (U$60) for 5 days of work, depending on the amount of work available. He has never taken loans in other banks and this is his 3rd loan with Hluvuku-Adsema. He asks for 12.000,00MT (U$450) to buy more products (rice, sugar, flour, etc). His first two loans where for 8.500,00MT and 10.500,00MT, for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to pay the loan back within reasonable time so he can apply for other loans, in order to buy a truck to help the transportation of merchandise he buys in Maputo.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She is a very responsible and happy person. She lives alone in her own house and what she wants most is to improver her quality of life. In a small room, Leticia has created her craft studio. Everyday, she starts work very early to fulfill requests. Her work is very sought after by her clients, since the crafts she makes are of very good quality. Currently, she is working for a taxi business, making decorations for their anniversary. What she likes most about her work is that she can create her crafts in the peace and quiet of her home.

With time, she hopes to open a large store in the center of the city, since currently, she only works through requests. This is her sixth loan with MFP. She is committed to make all the payments on time, since she does not want to cause problems for the members of her communal bank, where she is well liked for the happiness she shows.

A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price.

Each member has applied for a loan of 200,000 colons which will be used to make general investments in the expansion of their productive activities.\n\nThe women of this group are engaged in various entrepreneurial projects including plantain harvesting, the rearing and sale of livestock (poultry products) and the purchase of catalogue products for resale.\n\nSpecifically, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of all necessary materials, nutrients, and equipment that are used to plant and harvest plantains. Additionally, this loan will be used to increase working capital and facilitate the purchase of various household and clothing products which will be sold at a later date in the Bratsi community. Finally, this loan will enable group members to buy livestock (chickens) and animal feed to ensure the good health of animals and, in turn, guarantee a high quality final product.\n\nAccording to the group, a common goal is to secure a steady stream of revenues in order to maintain a constant level of working capital. This will allow the women to continually re-invest in their businesses and attract new clients. The women hope to increase sales so they will be able to use the revenues to help pay for their children\u00b4s studies.\n\nThe women of this group face many obstacles. The lack of job opportunities in Bratsi has led the members to take it upon themselves to create a way to make a living. The hot and humid climate of the Caribbean region creates an environment where livestock become susceptible to diseases. Maintaining the health of their animals has been a constant struggle for the members of this group. For the women involved in the planting and harvest of plantains, flooding has caused problems. As they cannot predict when a flood might occur, their livelihoods are at the mercy of Mother Nature.\n\nA major obstacle for all the women of this group has been a lack of financial resources to develop their entrepreneurial activities. This loan will help extend the reach of financial services to a poor community of hardworking women.\n\nThe name of this group, \u00a8United Women\u00a8, symbolizes the philosophy of solidarity and support expressed amongst members. These women have banded together because, they say, \u00a8individually it would be more difficult for us.\u00a8\n\nSara M. G. is the president of this group. This will be her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Sara is in the business of rearing and selling chickens and eggs. She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of livestock and animal feed in order to expand her business and sell more poultry products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":499527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

He is a hard working and responsible husband and father who lives in his own home with his wife, Justa, 52, and their 3 minor children to whom he wants to offer a better quality of life.  With his wife's support, Alejandro decided, 35 years ago, to buy some plots of land in which to work and thus improve his family's finances.  At present, he is still working the land, but it is much more productive now than before. Over time, he learned how to have greater production from his fields. What he likes the most about his job is the close relationship he has with the earth, and he also enjoys watching his plantings grow. He has been doing this for 40 years and he considers the hardest thing to be taking care of his fields in inclement weather, since any oversight can affect the crop. Looking ahead, he hopes that the price of vegetables goes up, since his working capital will be affected if the opposite happens.  This is the fiftth loan Alejandro has had with MFP. He is very happy to have obtained it, since he needed it urgently for his business. He is a well liked member of his communal bank, since he always brings order to the meetings. With the two thousand nuevos soles he has asked for, he will purchase more fertilizer for his plantings and he will also invest in purchasing cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":543917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"He will purchase fertilizer and some heads of cattle.

Benito is married and has three children who study in elementary school.  He works planting edible cactus, manzano chile peppers, peaches, avocado, carrots, potatoes, lettuce and other vegetables.  He has been cultivating vegetables for the past 15 years and says that his father was the one who taught him his love for the land and he says that he likes his work a lot.  He says that at times he also works in construction in his town and in the capital of his country where he can earn a bit more.  He notes that he is going to sell his vegetables in a central market in a town close to his own and he is asking for credit to purchase organic fertilizers and insecticides so that his vegetables will be of better quality.  Benito's goal is to purchase avocado plants and make a large garden in order to sell in bulk since he currently has very few trees.  He says he is very thankful for the credit that he will be given because it will help him improve the quality of life for his family.  \r\n\r\nThe other three members of his group are Reynaldo, Mariana and Virginia.  They will invest their loans in a fur shop, in appetizers, and in the selling of seasonal fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":912211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to plant and sell fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1351.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1438.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1469.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1501.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1566.99},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1600.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1635.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1670.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1706.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1743.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1781.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":209.23,"local_amount":2789.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2828.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573376},{"amount":222.85,"local_amount":2971.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3012.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785087},{"amount":232.57,"local_amount":3100.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3144.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193650},{"amount":242.71,"local_amount":3236.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3281.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330012},{"amount":253.29,"local_amount":3377.28,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044057},{"amount":264.35,"local_amount":3524.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3574,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656360}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T07:05:26Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:47:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":362502,"name":"Abdul Rahman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 32-year-old Abdul Rahman.

She is 34 years old, married, and has 6 children between the ages of 13 and 26.  The two youngest still attend school and the two oldest are already married.  She currently attends 12th grade, after having interrupted her education in the 6th grade, due to her early marriage.  She lives in her own home, and besides her children, she also supports two grandchildren who live with her. \r\n\r\nAngelica never left the city. When she was 24 years old she began to work at the DIC (Directorate of Civil Identification).  She currently works in Matola-Rio and earns a monthly salary of 3.290.00 MT.  She manages to save a bit because she has additional income from business activities, around 6.000.00 MT per month.  \r\n\r\nShe has never requested a loan from other institutions.  She learned about Hluvuku from her sister who is also a client. This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku, for the amount of 20.000.00 MT, which she plans to use to purchase cement, sheets of zinc, etc.  Her previous loans were for 10.000.00 MT, 13,000.00 MT, and 15,000.00 MT, all for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nThe challenge she faces is the high cost of construction materials.  She therefore plans to pay her loan properly to guarantee future loans without problems, so that she can have access to future loans to complete construction and purchase a vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

is a 39-year-old single mother of two from Para\u00edso de Cartago located in the central valley of Costa Rica. She has had to fight hard in order to improve living conditions for herself and her two children.\r\n\r\nPatricia has worked over the past ten years selling podiatrist (foot treatment) services. She learned how to work in podiatry as an employee in a clinic many years ago. She opened her business with an initial investment of 20,000 colones. She specializes in providing podiatry services to clients living with diabetes as well as to seniors.\r\n\r\nThis will be Patricia\u2019s second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer; her first loan was paid back on time and in full. Her goal is to increase her client base in order to earn more revenues and continue to provide a quality standard of living for her children.\r\n\r\nIn a good month Patricia might earn 600,000 colones and in a bad month, only 200,000. She dedicates eight hours a day to her business, while her children are at school. Patricia hopes to use the revenues from her business to finance housing costs, invest in home improvements, re-invest in her business, make contributions to her savings, and to repay her loan.\r\n\r\nThe income generated from Patricia\u2019s business represents 90% of family income and is used to finance the living expenses of Patricia and her two children. Her long term goals are to open her own clinic and to invest in higher quality education for her children. \r\n\r\nRecently, Patricia had a car accident. The use of her vehicle is central to the operation of her business as she uses it to visit clients and carry out her daily routine. She will use this loan to finance repairs to her car so that she can continue to work towards the expansion of her business. At the moment, she is using a car borrowed from a friend to conduct her business.\r\n\r\nPatricia says her only obstacle is time. If she had somebody to help her perform some of her domestic tasks, she would be able to dedicate more time to her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":509426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

They live in traditional families. They are all around 35 years old and have 5 children on average. They grow peanuts and corn for a living. \r\nWith the aim of boosting profits from their agricultural activities the group's members have decided to seek a loan from Soro Yiriwaso.  \r\nKOROTOUMOU S., the group's president, aims to use the loan to purchase a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, small tools and other inputs for cultivating these crops. They source their goods from Kimparana. Following wintering of the crops the harvest is stocked for a given length of time so that it may accrue value before being sold at the same market and in the neighbouring markets for retail and bulk sales. Sales are usually cash-based and the customers usually come from large towns. \r\nThe group's members aim to each generate between 30 000 and 45 000 FCFA which will be used to repay the loan and to meet their families' expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":584780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of inputs, seeds and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Warasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Bakoro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Legue ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi Warafo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":385000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":385000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":385000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-24T08:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":385054.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226150}],"funded_date":"2010-09-06T02:23:45Z","paid_date":"2011-05-24T08:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":227252,"name":"Rosmery","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosmery, de 29 a\u00f1os, es una joven madre de familia muy alegre y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia, junto a su esposo Alex de 29 a\u00f1os, quien trabaja en lima y sus dos hijos, Jefferson de 9 y Grisell de 5 a\u00f1os, a quienes desea brindarles una buena educaci\u00f3n.

The eleven members of this lending group are part of AMK\u2019s Loan Workout Program. All clients have outstanding loans that are delinquent and they are currently unable to pay back the full amount of their existing loan.\r\n\r\nTheir business ventures, which they funded using their existing loan, have failed, putting them in a very unfortunate position. In addition, less work at garment factories and sickness in their families have drastically reduced other sources of income for each family. All eleven clients will use their loan to start a new business making ties and pillow cases.\r\n\r\nAs part of AMK\u2019s workout program, each client is given a workout loan that will be used to purchase sewing machines, an electricity line and additional sewing equipment. AMK has hired a tailor to train the group to make ties and pillow cases. The material will be provided by AMK to ensure that quality material is used and so that the clients do not have to purchase it themselves.\r\n\r\nAMK has partnered with Ahkun.org to sell their ties and pillow cases online. Fifty percent of all profits will go to this group and the other borrowers in their village who are unable to repay their loan.\r\n\r\nThis program is in contrast to the traditional ways that microfinance institutions deal with delinquent clients.  These traditional ways are:\r\n\u2022 By rescheduling the loan and pushing off the problem to another day\r\n\u2022 Repossessing items that the clients own, including their house or land.\r\n\r\nBecause of AMK\u2019s strong social mission, AMK has created this program to provide an alternative solution to one of microfinance\u2019s dark sides. We hope that Kiva Lenders will support us in this initiative.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":629134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To start a new business making ties and pillow cases.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2010-11-02T00:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lory","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nov","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Duer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ban","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":857600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71466.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.34,"local_amount":435800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":481356.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182487229},{"amount":110.66,"local_amount":421800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":465893.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188622015}],"funded_date":"2010-11-02T03:15:30Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:07:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":247748,"name":"Javier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Javier lives in the village of Pan de Azucar in the district of Oyotun.

Together they are raising five children, of whom two are in elementary, one in high school, and the other two still staying at home. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nArlene presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and energy drinks to rice.  Having been at least ten years in business, she knows to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly she is able to earn a net income of Php 10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. Arlene plans to take this opportunity to drive her business toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nArlene's life is never without challenges, both in her business and in her personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":672520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and lives with her husband, son, daughter-in-law, and two grandsons.\r\n\r\nKandalat was born in 1953 into a large and simple farm family. From an early age, she was an independent child who helped her mother with the house. In 1972 after leaving school, Kandalat entered the national university to study biology. In 1977, she graduated, returned to the city of Osh, and  got a job teaching biology in high school. She had two children and continued to work at school while her husband worked in agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn 1982 Kandalat became the principal of the school, and she worked there until 2008. Because of the low salary, in 2008 Kandalat decided to quit and she and her family moved from Osh to the village of Novonikolaevka (in the Chuysky region in Kyrgyzstan). They bought a house and a three-hectare plot of land to grow fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nAt present, thanks to Kandalat\u2019s persistence and diligence, their holdings include one milk cow, three calves, and one bull.  Additionally they grow fruit, vegetables, and the grain and clover to sustain their own cattle on their three hectares and fourteen hectares they rent. Kandalat is asking for a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy watermelon seeds, wheat, and two calves for fattening. In time, Kandalat dreams of expanding their shed, increasing the number of livestock they own, and buying a nice house in the city of Karabalta (in the Chuysky region of Kyrgyzstan).\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":737240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds, wheat, and cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Novonikolaevka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kandalat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50403.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555461},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50403.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125363}],"funded_date":"2011-04-08T11:01:57Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":288722,"name":"Estacion De Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En esta fotografia se muestra al grupo llamado \u201cESTACION DE AMOR\u201d el cual esta ubicado en el estado de Puebla, M\u00e9xico.

WASSA intends to buy one sack of urea and two sacks of a fertilizer complex. \r\n\r\nThis equipment and these entrants are purchased at the big market in Sikasso. After the harvest at the end of the growing season, the products are stockpiled for a certain time so that their value rises before they are sold retail (often wholesale) at the big open-air market in Sikasso, to various customers. \r\n\r\nWASSA expects to make an average profit of 55,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the interest on the loan and to pay everyday expenses for her  family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":786630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy agricultural entrants.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her family in her own home and what she wants most for her children is to provide them a good education. Towards that aim, she works as a weaver, an activity that has many benefits and which has enabled her to take care of her family and provide for their needs. The items that Marleni weaves are of a very high quality, with beautiful finishing details. This has made her products very much in demand at the Sunday market where she sells them. Marleni gets much satisfaction from this activity, since she likes to weave and has done it with great dedication and care for the last six years.

They have similar business activities selling products by catalog.  Sra. Guilfa is a member of the group who is a hardworking single mother with four children, one of whom is already a professional while the rest are in school.  Guilfa is a dressmaker.  She makes high-quality clothing for women and has a good clientele.  In addition, she sells cosmetics through a catalog.  Guilfa receives assistance from the father of her children with a monthly pension to help pay for their education.  In the future, she hopes to produce garments in large quantities so that she can sell them in bulk and ship them to other provinces.  This will generate more income for her to support her children.\r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the group is involved in selling school materials, groceries, products from Argentina, cosmetics, or providing services such as health care and transportation.  They expect to continue working and rely on financing in order to achieve their goals.  Most have experience in their respective fields, so they are not afraid of competition because they have customers who demand their products and services.  The members are also very dynamic and quite sociable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used as operating capital because demand has increased and they need funding to purchase supplies and merchandise.  Most of the members have previous experience working with solidarity loans, so they know how to handle and manage the funds to their benefit in order to grow their businesses and support their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

By the grace of God, Meldred has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the younger ones to college. A dream for most Filipino parents, like Meldred, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMeldred operates a charcoal and firewood business. Many Filipinos are still using the old ways of firewood and charcoal cooking, which is the cheapest way to cook. Charcoal is sold in PHP 5 bags for easier lighting up. She also sells mineral water in their neighborhood. This is mostly used by nursing mothers and households with children, as normal tap water is already part of a normal adult's life. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 650 in sales every day for her firewood and mineral water refilling businesses.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of firewood and charcoal to be incorporated into her inventory. She will also be using a portion of the loan to buy mineral water to be retailed to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nMeldred dreams to be able to give her all of her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

One such individual is 50-year-old Nelson who, from the accounts of people who know him, is a personification of diligence. He is a stickler for hard work. That has been critical to the substantial advancement in his business skills in farming.\r\n\r\nThe father of 4 grows bananas on his farms. Needless to say, bananas are a staple food in most parts of Uganda. This means farmers like Nelson are doing a roaring trade selling their bananas to food traders who come all the way from the nation's capital, Kampala. He is based in Ntungamo. For most families in Ntungamo and other parts of Western Uganda, farming is a legacy. Most families have been able to contribute to their welfare with earnings from farming.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the successes, there have been quite a few impediments which have clouded the success of some farmers. Nelson says at times he is hard-pressed at times to get enough finances to purchase better and higher-grade manure. He also says some seasons are particularly difficult as pests destroy his banana crop. However, he has remained philosophical in the face of all adversity which explains his longevity over the past decade. His second line of business is the sale of livestock. He says this business generates close to 200,000 Uganda shillings in weekly sales income for him. He says he intends to utilize this Kiva loan to purchase high-grade manure and pesticides, and to pay fees for his kids.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":843588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase high-grade manure and pesticides, and to pay fees for his kids.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-08-12T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damiano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Consiranta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":10040000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1673333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1673333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1673333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1673333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1673333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1673333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1863.27,"local_amount":4988600,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4994314.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868647},{"amount":635.46,"local_amount":1701333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1703281.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648484},{"amount":624.44,"local_amount":1671834,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1673748.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313830},{"amount":19.28,"local_amount":51617,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":51676.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275439},{"amount":607.55,"local_amount":1626616,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1628479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223728}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T01:33:50Z","paid_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":329723,"name":"Zuhra","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0417\u0443\u0445\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0415\u0439 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u0445\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435 -
