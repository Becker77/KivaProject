appears in her Kiva profile photo. The photo was taken in their house. Noor is a 24-year-old young woman who is married and a mother to three sons and two daughters. Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nNoor is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of painting her house and installing new tiles in order to improve the living conditions in the family's house. Taking this loan will offer Noor and her family suitable home conditions, so the family can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

22-year-old Gavin, along with his partner Jeremy, decided to open a men's vintage clothing shop. Hello Boys, located in Nashville, is a \"sister\" store to Goodbuy Girls, which is owned and operated by close friends of Gavin and Jeremy. \r\n\r\nA determined and self-motivated person, Gavin had the idea to open a consignment shop, found an available place, purchased inventory, redecorated what used to be an office, established a website and opened his store , all within two months. He designed the boutiquestyle store to have shadow boxes that showcase merchandise and allow customers to see the fashionable and complete outfits.\r\n \r\nAfter acquiring a loan from Accion in the Delta, Gavin paid for shelving, the store's first month's rent and deposit and other supplies. He credits the loan for allowing the doors of Hello Boys to open on August 10. After his first weekend of business, they had to temporarily close the shop because they sold out of the majority of their inventory and needed time to replenish.  But doors are open again!  (And word is spreading rapidly about the exciting new venture. Gavin reports that legendary musician Elvis Costello and his family recently paid a visit to the shop.)\r\n\r\nHello Boys also helps sustain jobs. Gavin hired a local artist to help design the store's layout, make the color choices and paint the space. He also contributes to the success of others by selling shirts created by local entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nFor more info about the company, visit www.facebook.com\/helloboysnashville.

is Raquel, 34 years old and a resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is a mother to her child. By the grace of God, Pelagia has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to sustain their expenses.\n\nRaquel has a modular design business.  It is an approach that subdivides a system &#40;for example, a room in the office&#41; into smaller parts (modules) that can be independently created and then used in different systems to drive multiple business uses.  She earns a minimum of PHP 50,000 monthly.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy wood, hinges and other materials needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nRaquel dreams of expanding her business soon, just as she wants her child to graduate from college.

She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nRegina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to expand her business. She dreams of giving her family a good life.

She has been a member of VisionFund for six cycles already and completely paid back the loans, while her group co-member has been with VisionFund for three cycles. \r\n\r\nThe past loans have helped her family with sufficient food and better support the business. Currently, she can earn about 36,000 KHR per day from the business. Now she is leading her group to apply for a loan. \r\n\r\nShe wants to use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland. She hopes to grow her rice fruitfully and healthily so as to improve her standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1197047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-22T01:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-22T01:00:16Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1014250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942107}],"funded_date":"2012-09-22T04:57:08Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":473468,"name":"Antonieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonieta is 52 years old and married with 2 children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming rice in the Philippines.

He has been making stringed musical instruments for quite a long time. He has his workshop in the Second of April zone in the city of El Alto. This loan is his first one with this institution. Sr. Alejandro is going to use it to buy materials to make his instruments. This is work that is a bit slow going, since everything is hand work, since it has a lot of details.

Ten years ago she started up her own business venture, because her friend who used to sell perfumes, creams and cosmetics left this area and so an area of the market was not being attended to.  Aware of an opportunity she stepped in, taking small orders for cologne and perfumes.  She started to gradually buy glass display cases until she converted her business into a general store where she sells a variety of miscellaneous items.  She added washing machines in order to offer this service to the housewives in the neighborhood.  She makes her sales on credit every day from 8am until 9 at night, taking a period of rest in between.  She makes her purchases mainly from wholesalers who sell products from multiple chains, and through specialized catalogs offering products or goods for sale.  This is how she obtains her products to sell.\r\n\r\nJulia's goal for the future is to buy more display cases and gradually expand her inventory of goods.  This will allow her to attract more customers and better position herself in the marketplace over time.  She has now approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to request a Kiva loan to buy perfumes, cosmetics and clothing through orders, as well as two additional washing machines.  This way she can generate other sources of income and see her business prosper.

He comes from a small village on the island of Maluku, a rather small native village. Ridolof is the fifth child of six children whose parents have been divorced since 2009, when he was in junior high school. Given the family's limited economic condition, Ridolof had no plans for college because his mother, who works only as a maid, must finance the education of Ridolof and his sister who is still in school. Ridolof hopes to obtain a loan from Kiva so he can continue his studies and realize his aspiration to be a professional sailor. This will make his mother and younger siblings happy.

Wenie needs to earn more money to provide a good education for her three children despite being a single parent.

She previously accessed a 15,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 18,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMaria Luisa hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to have a simple yet happy family.

","en":"Carmen is 35 years old.  She is separated from her spouse and lives with her high-school aged son in the city of Santo Domingo of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  Santo Domingo is connected to the Sierra and Costa del Ecuador regions.  The city has become a commercial hub with its many growing sectors evident in the various entrepreneurial families that started small businesses just a few years back and are now creating employment opportunities.  Studies reveal that most businesses started organically and have been supported by the passing of tourists, business people, and travelers who move from one region to the other.  It is also the third most populous city in the country.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been making a living selling cosmetics for the last five years.  Her business model is to visit her customers at their respective homes or workplace.

","en":"In Ecuador you'll find the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, known for its variety of animals seen in their natural habitat.  It's a place where struggle and enterprise are the daily subsistence of every family.  It's a key region, being the main connection between the mountain and coastal regions, and has managed to make its capital, Santo Domingo, into an exemplary city whose growth is supported by high activity in commerce, agriculture, and tourism.  This is where Silvio lives; he's a fifty-six-year-old divorced man who is known for being hardworking and very persistent.  \r\n\r\nSilvino earns his living selling oranges and cheese, a business he's been in for five years.  He invests his time Monday through Friday to increase his income so he can finish construction on his house, which he hasn't managed to do because he's lacked the funds.  This will be his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, but he's sure that he can rely on them to strengthen and grow his business because they always give him timely and reliable financial counsel.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1196089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy oranges and cheese to increase his income so he can finish his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-22T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-22T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvino Bartolome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":121.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":127.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":130.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":138.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":142.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.13},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":247.88,"local_amount":245.49,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":247.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382673},{"amount":126.32,"local_amount":125.11,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989755},{"amount":128.75,"local_amount":127.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126163},{"amount":262.01,"local_amount":259.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":262.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068621},{"amount":135.08,"local_amount":133.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494896},{"amount":135.87,"local_amount":134.56,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":135.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524822},{"amount":138.13,"local_amount":136.8,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":138.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133134},{"amount":142.63,"local_amount":141.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":142.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313681},{"amount":141.24,"local_amount":139.88,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565288},{"amount":142.09,"local_amount":140.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814343}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T11:45:43Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:22:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":473001,"name":"Soyol-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soyol-Erdene, 23, is a nurse in a medical center.

From an early age he really loved to read all manner of books.  His highly developed intellect and fortitude allowed him to finish high school with good grades and succeed in getting into college.  In time he became a second-year student at Technology University of Tajikistan, but that year his parents couldn't afford to pay for his studies, so Parvix is seeking a loan to pay for college.

In Ecuador, the city is known for its rich cuisine, especially hallullas (hard crackers made from bread that are a tradition in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile) and quesos de hoja (long sheets of cheese).  The area is also known for raising livestock and agriculture that is sustained by the mild climate, cold and warm humidity.  The poverty index is more than 50%, but the majority of the inhabitants have basic services (water, electricity, etc) in their homes.\r\n\r\nMario learned from his parents how to raise livestock for later sale and also to sell the milk that they produce.  Two years ago, he decided to involve himself more deeply in the business and learn this work, which he does for eight hours a day without help from anyone.  Although many merchants oppose paying a fair price, Mario is asking for a loan to purchase more animals and items to care for them so that he can offer these animals a price that allows him to generate a higher profit.  He will create a savings account so that one day he can achieve his dream of building his own house.

This year she planted organic carrots, potatoes and garlic in a one hectare garden. She sells her business products at an exhibition in the capital city.

She is married and a mother of three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a worker who earns a modest salary which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\nFor the past four years, Nisreen has been doing embroideries and selling them to customers upon their request. It has been a profitable venture but it also needs support from time to time to cover the cost.\r\nNisreen is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing new fabrics and threads. Taking this loan will increase demand and requests from her customers to buy embroideries. This will increase her income and provide her family with better living conditions. Nisreen is photographed while she is doing embroidery.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is a UN employee and her husband is also employed but both are earning low salaries that are not enough to cover the family's needs and costs.\r\n\r\nSa'eda is therefore requesting a loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture for her children in order to improve their living conditions in the house. Taking this loan will offer to her children comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in the house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Three years ago, she decided to sell products through catalogs such as Avon, Vogue, and Arabella.  The products she sells include cr\u00e8mes, lotions, shampoo, sandals, clothing, deodorants, dyes, cleaning products, and all other types of cosmetics.  Her sales are conducted as a traveling merchant since she must deliver orders to her customers\u2019 homes, as well as sell from her own house.  \r\n<p>\r\nKenia has completed two loan cycles and is now requesting a loan of 8,000 HNL that she will invest in more products that her customers have ordered.

","en":"Aida, 29, lives with her partner Erwin, who is a farmer of the same age.  They have two children: Byron, 13, and Dayana, 11.  Aida is from Otavalo, but she lives in the El Pacto parish, located in the canton of San Miguel de Lo Bancos.  This is a town that is visited by many people because of its waterfalls and the biodiversity of species that one can observe passing through the countryside.  This place has an exceptional gastronomy; it's known for its traditional dishes that are sold by many of its residents.  In addition to this, the local hotels, agricultural supply stores and offerings of extreme sports activities, support the economic growth of the city.  In the rural neighborhoods there are households who are devoted to farming and livestock activities, so this area also specializes in the processing of milk and its derivatives, such as cheese, sweet milk, and other dairy products.\r\n\r\nAida inherited her parents' talent for making \"panela,\" a food that is made from a base of sugarcane which is full of vitamins and nutrients that are good for the human body.  She uses this to make drinks, and it also serves as a natural sweetener and energizer.   It has curative properties, from healing wounds to treating ulcers.  Aida has been making this product for 6 years, and she invests up to 10 hours a day in this business while also attending to her home.  She needs to increase her income to support her husband in paying for the education of their children.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from the Fundacion Alternativa to buy more supplies to increase her production.  This way, she will realize her dream of seeing her children grow up in excellent living conditions while finishing their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1196308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to improve her crops and increase her production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-22T19:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-22T19:40:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":844.8,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88.78},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.43,"local_amount":78.94,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":79.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149538},{"amount":80.95,"local_amount":80.46,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":80.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382681},{"amount":81.78,"local_amount":81.28,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989763},{"amount":83.26,"local_amount":82.75,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126170},{"amount":84.2,"local_amount":83.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516771},{"amount":440.38,"local_amount":437.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":440.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068629}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T19:53:20Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":472808,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan, est\u00e1 casado, tiene un hijo, administra una panader\u00eda, es un joven emprendedor quien despu\u00e9s de aprender el trabajo como panadero, puso su propio negocio, hoy en d\u00eda cuenta con un negocio crecido y  bien fundado, tiene a su cargo ocho empleados directos, trabaja todos los d\u00edas las ocho horas,tiene un horno, por el momento no cuenta con sala de ventas, se caracteriza por ser un  distribuidor.\nNos ha solicitado un  pr\u00e9stamo por que necesita invertirlo en la compra de insumos para producir pan como harina, azucar, levadura y en la compra de moldes donde se  coloca el pan para que pase al horno de cocci\u00f3n.

She is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who, together with her husband, puts all her efforts into providing for her family.  In her free time she enjoys watching television to unwind and she often prepares one of her favorite dishes: delicious 'tallarines rojos' (similar to spaghetti).

As he thinks, his home will be warmer after the wall and roof insulation and a new smart furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on the natural gas.

For the past year she\u2019s been working on her own fruit and vegetables sales business; she sells from a small stall in her home. The business is profitable, and she uses her profits to cover her family's expenses.

He is photographed here next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nRami is requesting a loan from FATEN to help cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. His loan will increase his taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable him to take on additional service requests which will improve his family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Their patterns are very much in demand in their community, and they have a good client list. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of PKR.15000 provided to them by Kashf foundation, they plan to purchase raw materials such as fabric, threads, pearls and needles.

Sindy can work around 10 hours, and she feels that it\u2019s going well because of her dedication and the kind treatment she offers her customers. \r\n\r\nSindy is very grateful for the Kiva borrowers, because thanks to the help they have offered, she will be able to carry out her purchases of merchandise like children\u2019s clothing, such as polo shirts, sweatshirts, and sweaters, among others. In this way, Sindy will have a more well-stocked business;  she will continue working and making a good effort so that together with her little daughter, she can move ahead.

Her husband is a driver and his monthly income is very low to support his family alone.\r\n\r\nShe has one machine and now she wants to purchase one more sewing machine for one of her daughters to increase their sewing capacity, so she requested a loan of 15,000 PKR so that her family's income will be increased and they will be able to manage their household efficiently. Her loan has been approved by Kashf Foundation. Her husband is very happy to see the increasing growth of her business. Now she is saving a healthy amount of income for their better future.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Guaman\u00ed is one of the most densely-populated neighborhoods in the city and so it has attracted a lot of businesses which are used by all its residents.  In recent years, the private sector has taken advantage of this growth, expanding investment and building shopping malls, residential developments, etc.  Guaman\u00ed now experiences some security problems owing to several night clubs which have been opened in recent years.  However, in spite of this, the locals do not lose hope and they are always coming up with new business ideas that benefit everybody.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at a previous maize plantation and he says that the last season went well. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He is married to a farmer and they have two young children. \r\n\r\nJean D'Amour has been a maize farmer for 15 years. He will use his Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance his farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at the previous maize plantation. Jean D'Amour says that the last season went well. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
