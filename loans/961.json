He will use his Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance his farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at the previous maize plantation. Jean D'Amour says that the last season went well. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at the previous maize plantation, and she says that the last season went well. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He lives in the town of Malpaisillo in the department of Le\u00f3n, which is known for being an agricultural area with crops such as plantains, corn, and rice.  Silvio Jos\u00e9 works selling tajadas (a typical dish in Nicaragua made by cutting and frying green plantains which is served with chopped cabbage), fried potatoes, and other fried foods.  He has had this business for 14 years.  He has a full credit history since he always pays on time and in full.  His business is located in the commercial area of Malpaisillo.  He started this business with his own initiative and learned about it while he was living in Costa Rica.  \r\n\r\nCurrently he is facing challenges and problems, including his mother's illness (blood pressure).

The agriculture sector accounts for 37 percent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 percent of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90 percent of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is from Abasha district of West Georgia. She is 51 years old and lives with her husband and a daughter. The family runs animal husbandry business-they have 4 milk cows and 4 calves. Nani milks the cows and produces cheese products. She also has a nut garden and a plot of land where maize is grown. The family sells on average 300 kg nuts and 800 kg maize per year.  Nani works hard to make some savings and improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan to increase the number of cattle.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is 44 years old. He is married to a farmer and they have both eight children aged between five and twenty four, they all go to schools. He has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken recently at the previous maize plantation and says that the last season went well. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Viateur himself has been a maize farmer for 16 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and to buy more fertilizers during maize production, as he needs to buy fertilizers in order to increase his production. Viateur wishes to invest in his business with profits gained from farming, so that in the future he can acquire machinery like tractors, which will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo shown was taken recently, at the previous maize plantation. Viateur says that the last season went well.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He emigrated to the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n at a young age, in search of better opportunities, and put down roots in the municipality of Santa Catarina. He started working in a bakery as an apprentice, and then became a baker himself. He made a lot of sacrifices in order to set up a tiny bakery of his own. He then bought a bicycle and started to sell bread in the streets, helping his business grow. Some time after his bakery became well-established, he left it to his older son and set up a small fruit and vegetable shop with his wife. Anastacio buys fruits and vegetables that are still edible but that are discarded by supermarkets, and sells them at low prices to people with very low income. Anastacio is very happy to be able to help so many people in his town. He asks for this loan to buy wooden stands on which to place the produce so as to help customers choose and buy it easily and quickly, thus bringing them better service.

She is single. She has been a farmer for the past 5 years. She will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizers in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at another maize plantation and Mariette says that the last season went well. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Fidel makes his living working the land where he grows coffee plants. His parents showed him how to plough the land at a young age, and some five years ago Fidel bought his own plot of land which he has been working ever since then.\r\n\r\nWhen it is time to harvest and weed, Fidel needs assistance which is why he hires day laborers in order to finish his work at a faster rate. He feels very involved in his work, because it is thanks to his efforts on a daily basis that today he can enjoys seeing that his plants are producing, and obtaining good profits from their sale.\r\n\r\nHe mentions that when it rains heavily, plagues afflict the fruits on his plants and mean that his good produce is damaged.

They live in the south of Quito, the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  More specifically, they live in the Chimbacalle neighborhood, which is emblematic of Quito primarily for being the home of the Capital's only train station. It is going to be converted into a railway museum which, on par with neighboring museums, has become one of the most visited tourist attractions in the country.  In addition this attraction, in the last few years, the southern area of Quito has developed remarkably, both urban-wise and financially.  Investors have bet on planting their ideas in various key points of this sector.  \r\nMartha grew up in Chimbacalle in a low-income family.  She was able to finish primary school.  She got married very young, and thanks to what a friend taught her, she decided to earn some money by making \u201cespumilla,\u201d an Ecuadorian dessert (similar to a meringue) loved by children and adults alike.  She started the business 8 years ago and spends about 3 hours a day on it.  In addition to her household chores, she also sells cosmetics, which gives her an additional income.  With the loan, Martha hopes to make more daily \u201cespumilla\u201d and to purchase products to increase her cosmetics stock so that she can earn the income she needs to provide her family with stable finances.

Luisa has four children but all are adults.  She has many hopes for her business.  This is why she's going to buy paper and office supplies.  One of her goals is to leave the business stable for her children and grandchildren.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1198712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy paper and office supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-09-23T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-23T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1563.97,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":98.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":111.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":113.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":121.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":178.84,"local_amount":177.59,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":178.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331302},{"amount":93.12,"local_amount":92.47,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":93.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939937},{"amount":96.22,"local_amount":95.54,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":96.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072363},{"amount":97.44,"local_amount":96.76,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":97.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318718},{"amount":99.67,"local_amount":98.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":99.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013458},{"amount":104.4,"local_amount":103.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453815},{"amount":905.31,"local_amount":898.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":905.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459660}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T18:58:21Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":474566,"name":"Germania Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Germania es una persona amable, de muy buen caracter que trata con cualquier persona, le gusta su trabajo y desea tener \u00e9xito en su vida y mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia.

Her income in the business goes towards the welfare of her children. \r\n\r\nAs a single parent, Visitacion works hard to succeed in the businesses she manages. She runs a store where she invested PHP 50,000 as current revolving capital. Activities that made Visitacion busy most of the time are the simple buying and selling of corn during harvest season using the PHP 20,000 initial capital.\r\n\r\nShe wants to borrow PHP 30,000 that will be used as additional capital in her store. She will buy stock of different grocery items like noodles, canned goods, soda, powdered juice, bread, and many more items. Some of the loan will also be invested in corn to buy and sell to get a bigger income. As she said, the bigger the capital, the bigger the income.\r\n\r\nSomeday, when her business revolving fund is stable, she wants to develop a grocery store in their place.  Her corn buying and selling will improve further to become competitive with other traders that are present in their place.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1197953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband is Felix, a businessman.  She has one child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGemma maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange.  A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue; these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000.  She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGemma hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work every week.

Her family lives in a rural area in the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Cambodia. She has been in rice farming on two hectares of farmland for twelve years to make a living. She can earn about 12,000 KHR per day and saves about 7,000 KHR each day after daily expenses. The main challenge for her is scarcity of fertilizer to support her rice paddy. \r\n\r\nEy's group consists of four female members.

Alor is a small village with very low economic growth, even though in that village there are a lot of small harbors, because the education level is really low. Lukas' parents work as farmers with income of only 150,000 IDR (around $16 US) per month. He has three brothers who are nine, eight and five years old. His brothers can\u2019t go to school anymore. Lukas chose to leave his village because he really wants to continue his education in the Maritime Academy. Lukas hopes that the loan from Kiva will give him a challenge to make his family's living conditions better, because when he graduates from the Maritime Academy, he will get a job on a National or International ship as a professional sailor and will get a good salary. This way he can help all his brothers continue their education for their future. He knows that his parents will be very grateful if he can finish his education at the Maritime Academy in Cilacap because of the loan from Kiva.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 30 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that, in the future, he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at another maize farming plantation. Silas was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37 percent of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65 percent of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90 percent of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is married to Jeter and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  Angelita  earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Angelita is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelita hopes to grow her business and dreams that her children will all finish college through all her hard work on her business.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

This will increase sales and improve Abdullah's income, which will ensure a better future for him.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is married to a farmer. They have one child aged four. He has been a maize farmer for 17 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the photo taken recently at another maize farming plantation, he was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He lives with his wife and three children who are between the ages of 10 and 18. For the past five years he has had a store where he sells food, groceries, and general goods from the family food basket. His main customer base is located in the area where he lives. They purchase small quantities from him daily using cash in accordance with the families\u2019 income. \r\n\r\nHis experience dates back to when he was an assistant in a store, and little by little he learned how to manage the business. He starts work at 5 a.m. and continues until 10 in the evening after the last customer leaves. He mainly makes his purchases in cash at the granaries and the market plaza where they give him good prices. \r\n\r\nLately his clientele has increased, and his inventory has been turning over quickly. Many customers come and buy out many of his products, which is why he is turning to a Kiva loan. This is the first loan at the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use the loan to purchase groceries such as rice, oil, sugar, cereal grains, and frozen meats. \r\n\r\nBeing fully stocked will increase his sales, and little by little he can achieve his goal of expanding the infrastructure of the premises, extending it to the corner of his home.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is a resident of Taguig, Philippines. Virginia is married to Cesar, a tricycle driver, and she is a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the businesses. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVirginia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to have many loyal customers and dreams to have a good life with her family through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1198136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2781.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114776},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.03,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3475.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350831},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2781.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959937},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1390.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094650}],"funded_date":"2012-09-24T15:15:00Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":474149,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma works hard to support her family.

Therefore, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her house is in Chincha, a city that is characterized by its warm and welcoming climate as well as being the birthplace of great Peruvian sporting glories. Also, its people are very happy and above all have a knack for preparing delicious traditional dishes. The city of Chincha has beautiful beaches and is developing agriculture and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nLaura is the mother of three children, two of which are now adults and the third is 16 and studying in high school. Laura is a hard-working mother, especially since their father abandoned the children and she has taken over that role. When she has a little time off, she likes going out for walks with her children and sometimes prepares one of her favorite dishes - the delicious 'tallarines rojos' (red spaghetti).\r\n\r\nLaura works enthusiastically as a saleswoman in a telephone company in her town. She works about 10 hours a day, and with a lot of effort she is able to meet her household expenses. Laura believes she is doing well in her business because she works hard, and is eager for her family to succeed. \r\n\r\nLaura is grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to the help she is receiving she is able to purchase construction materials such as sand, cement and iron bars, among others. With this loan, she can continue to build your home. As a result of the earthquake in 2007, Laura had lost her home and is still working towards rebuilding it and struggling to realize her biggest dream: \"To provide a good education for her children and to finish building her house for her family.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1191389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He is still single. Eddie and his parents manage their own household while operating a business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEddie operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. He rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue to operate his business, he is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in his business. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nEddie dreams of having a bigger computer shop. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and were he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1198134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Xavier was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both his family needs and his business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The photo was taken recently at a previous maize farming plantation. Grace was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Cambodia, Sorn is a 48-year-old mother of seven children. Two of her children are dependent on her and still in school. She has been involved in selling grocery items for five years and supplementing her income by selling pork meats. The current business earns her approximately 22,000 KHR per day, and she manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n\r\nSorn has been with Kiva partner VisionFund for three cycles while the other member of her group is with VisionFund just this cycle. Sorn's past loans have helped her to build a new proper stall for supporting her grocery-selling business; all her loans have been repaid already. Now she and her group member are requesting a loan with VisionFund of 1,400,000 KHR and 1,000,000 KHR respectively. As the leader, Sorn is going to use her portion to buy more grocery items to sell such as sugar, salt and eggs, and also plans to use a portion of it to buy more pork for resale. She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her income so as to improve her standard of living and keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1197295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married to a farmer. She has been a maize farmer for 16 years. She will use the Kiva loan to cover labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently with the previous maize crop. She was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both her family and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is married to Albina, 48, and they live in their own home with their three beloved children, who are the main motive for all their efforts. M\u00e1ximo works growing coffee, cacao, and pineapples. Every day, very early in the morning, he works with his crop, since he knows the money he gets for his products will depend heavily on the quality of his harvest. \r\n\r\nHis harvests are sold in his district, since that is where people offer him the best prices. His favorite part of his job is harvesting his lands, since that is when he feels that the months of work have paid off. He has been doing this job for 15 years and thinks that the hardest part is taking the products from the harvest to the place where they are dried. In the future, he hopes to buy more land to increase his production. \r\n\r\nThis is his seventh loan. He feels that the money from the loan will help him in the progress of his work. In his communal bank, he is well-liked by the rest of the members, because he is very supportive of them. With the 2,000 new soles, he will buy sacks of organic fertilizer for the good production of his crops. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1198619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2012.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974332}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T19:17:59Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":475868,"name":"Saodat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439 (\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b, \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0431\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0446\u043e\u0432, \u0442\u044b\u043a\u0432\u044b). \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0430\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0443.

Constance was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both her family needs and her business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Paul was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business progress. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
