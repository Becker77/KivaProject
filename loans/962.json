He is married to a farmer; they both have three children. He has been a maize farmer for 40 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. \r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. He was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at a previous maize farming plantation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is married to a farmer. She has been a maize farmer for 10 years. She will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production.   She needs to buy fertilizer to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business, so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at  another maize plantation.  Yvonne was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product; generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She will recover some broken and bad parts of the walls with cement and foam. This will reduce heat loss and Bayarkhuu will pay less for coal. Using coal is very harmful for her family's health and the environment, as she knows.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems and to buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Bayarkhuu is taking will be dedicated to buying some building and insulation materials for her home repair. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1198288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy some building and insulation materials for her home repair.

Every day he loads and transports a lot of freight to the trucks or vans. He lives with his wife and his two sons in a poorly equipped house in Ger district, an area of Erdenet, the third largest city in Mongolia, with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Currently his wife is unemployed and looks after the babies at home. Bat-Erdene will use his loan to replace the dated wooden floor and windows in his home, improving its insulation (due to the heat loss through the existing windows). In winter he uses a water-heated furnace to keep his home warm. It is expensive and very wasteful of water. Bat-Erdene says if he can make his planned repairs, his heating costs will be cut notably and it will allow him to make a contribution to the environment.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  In winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  Furthermore, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is a main source of Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and buy cars which run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Bat-Erdene is taking will be used to buy building materials for his home repair.

She sells palm oil, gari and pepper. She has been running this business for 28 years. She works at the business from 5:30 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., seven days per week. Her business is the only income she has. Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network to the village where she buys goods.\n\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more food like palm oil, gari and pepper. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to build a shop structure on her own and increase her business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Jhon is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because due to their help he will be able to cover the costs of paying the registration fee and the monthly payments for his studies.  In this way Jhon will be able to continue with his professional studies, and will continue working and striving to become a good professional and to have his own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1199780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Dilbar is 39 years old, married and has two children. She owns a family business, a cafe where she works as a chef and her daughter helps out. Dilbar's husband is responsible for purchasing all the groceries for the kitchen. Dilbar prepares a variety of Tajik and Western dishes and has many regular clients, mainly taxi and shuttle drivers, as the cafe is located near the taxi\/shuttle depot. Dilbar wants to spruce up her cafe's interior and purchase construction materials for this job. She has turned to KIVA for a loan since she lacks the savings to finance the project by herself.

Helena relies on her husband\u2019s pension to meet her family's needs but it is often insufficient.

The little income generated from the business enables her to pay for her daughter's school expenses.

Pueblo Nuevo is a focal point in this canton and it\u2019s where Oswaldo lives with his wife and children who are 12 and 9 years old.  It\u2019s noted for being a place that produces more than one million liters of milk per month; it\u2019s the local residents\u2019 main activity.\r\n\r\nOswaldo learned this cattle-related activity from his parents; he\u2019s been doing it for 15 years for at least 8 hours daily.  Oswaldo is now aiming at owning his own farm but to reach this goal he must increase his income which is why he contacted a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa executive who advised him about the loans, training and rural sector support available there so that enterprising people like him could get ahead.  This led to him to request a loan that he will use to buy cows to make his dream a reality and provide his family with stability and wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1200351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cows to increase milk production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswaldo  Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":853.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.98,"local_amount":61.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382686},{"amount":68.44,"local_amount":66.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989769},{"amount":69.79,"local_amount":68.1,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":69.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126176},{"amount":70.47,"local_amount":68.76,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":70.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516777},{"amount":71.5,"local_amount":69.76,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068635},{"amount":73.3,"local_amount":71.52,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":73.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494907},{"amount":73.62,"local_amount":71.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":73.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524833},{"amount":74.87,"local_amount":73.06,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":74.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133142},{"amount":152.8,"local_amount":149.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":152.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565295},{"amount":78.02,"local_amount":76.13,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":78.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320531},{"amount":79.21,"local_amount":77.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102417}],"funded_date":"2012-09-29T13:11:04Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":474309,"name":"Ganbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganbold is 47 years old, and he has been working in the power plant for 24 years nonstop.

He believes that he does well at work because of his drive to get ahead and because he has a reason to get ahead: his son.\r\n\r\nMiguel is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given him he will be able to buy a larger capacity compressor and materials like paint, lacquer, sandpaper and putty, among others in order to have the necessary materials and tools to do his work and continue striving to make his greatest dream a reality: to provide his son with a good education and to have a shop of his own.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1191357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"  to buy a compressor, paint, lacquer, sandpaper, putty, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":140.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":143.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":151.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":155.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":161.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":174.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":181.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":202.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.08,"local_amount":273.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":275.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345590},{"amount":55.7,"local_amount":143.73,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":144.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089198},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":306.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":308.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478743},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":161.24,"processed_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":162.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031424},{"amount":66.57,"local_amount":171.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":172.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775924},{"amount":67.49,"local_amount":174.18,"processed_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":175.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482738},{"amount":219.26,"local_amount":565.84,"processed_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":569.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390774556},{"amount":78.64,"local_amount":202.93,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":204.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399778579}],"funded_date":"2012-10-05T07:11:34Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:38:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":467587,"name":"Intan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Group \u201cIntan\u201d  began to form in October 19, 2009, and has been running 2 months short of 3 years.

is a farmer in Murang\u2019a, where he has practiced farming for twelve successive years. He is running his farm with two farmhands and is currently producing cabbages, tomatoes, flowers, and tea for the local market. He gets additional income from retailing horticultural products, which he sources from his farm as well as from other farmers in the area.\r\n\r\nJesee has made a request for 35,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy farm inputs for his horticultural farming business.

","en":"Juan de Dios is a 56 year old man who describes himself as very organized.  Proof of this is that after he retired from the store where he worked, he continued making contributions to the social security system to obtain his pension and he has already completed the contribution period required to qualify to receive his pension.  Now, he only has to wait until he is 60 years old.  Juan de Dios worked for several years as a salesman at a clothing store.  After retiring, he decided to start his own business.  He took advantage of the experience he had gained and the relationship that he had with the suppliers in order to undertake his business venture.  He still works from his home, which is his place of business.  Currently, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will purchase curtains, tablecloths, towels, sheets, jeans, sweaters, pillows, fans, and blenders.  His dream is to find a business location with a medium-term rent in order to separate the business from his residence.  During this time, he\u2019ll monitor his monthly sales financial indicators, which provide a 40% average profit margin and a 60 day inventory turnover, indexes that are customary in this type of business.

Her husband is employed in a small general store, and one of her sons works in a repairing shop of cars. However, their income is very unpredictable and not enough to cover everyday expenditures. \n\nShe is a loving mother of six children; three of them are school-going while two stay at home. She is in charge of providing her family with good food, health and education. She has slowly but surely improved her business by taking loans from the Kashf Foundation. Now she requested a loan of Rs. 15,000 Pakistan rupees to buy stock of threads and pearls in different colors to meet the increasing demand for her embroidery designs. She hopes to have more profits and hence, better support her family. She desires to spend a part of earnings on two of her daughters' education. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1197410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock of threads and pearls in different colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1062},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1093},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1157},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1191},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1226},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1262},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1299},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1337},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1376},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1456}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.39,"local_amount":1062,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1172.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315428486},{"amount":12.75,"local_amount":1093,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1206.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323033644},{"amount":13.13,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1242.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331169785},{"amount":13.5,"local_amount":1157,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1277.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339552535},{"amount":13.89,"local_amount":1191,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347102403},{"amount":14.3,"local_amount":1226,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355847575},{"amount":14.73,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1393.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556254},{"amount":15.15,"local_amount":1299,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1434.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372954753},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":1337,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1476.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381734602},{"amount":16.05,"local_amount":1376,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1519.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390821637},{"amount":33.26,"local_amount":2872,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":399842236}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T00:55:59Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T13:34:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":474356,"name":"Mustafa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mustafa is married.

She's forty-five years old, married and has one son. For the past seven years she's run an animal raising business. She owns two cows and two bulls. She has many buyers on the market and usually sells cattle to them after taking care of it for several months.

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This communal bank is named \"Santa Teresita\" and it's comprised of 15 entrepreneurs. They're in various lines of work, such as sewing, owning a sales stall, selling clothing, selling salads, cleaning products, selling cosmetics, providing services, etc. All of them belong to the township of Quilicura, located in the city of Santiago.\r\nClaudia is a member of the communal bank. In the photograph she's sitting in the front row, the first one from the left. She's wearing a black vest and black trousers, and she wears her dark brown hair down. She has her little niece sitting on her legs.\r\nShe's been in the weaving business for a year, specifically curtains, tablecloths and sheets. She reports that she works from home, Monday through Sunday, and sometimes she gets help from her daughter. She mentions that she learned to sew on her own.\r\nShe buys the materials she needs for weaving her sheets and curtains in the township of Independencia. The town is known for selling supplies both by wholesale and retail, at various quality levels and low prices, so it's financially convenient.\r\nWith the loan she'll purchase only supplies.\r\nOne of Claudia's goals is to stay in the weaving business and take some classes in order to hone her skills. Therefore she'll increase her profits and provide good living conditions for her children.\r\nClaudia lives with her husband, two children aged 12 and 24, and a little niece. Career-wise, her dream is to enlarge a room she has in her house. That way she'll put her machines there and she'll tend to her customers more easily.\r\nShe's very glad and grateful for the opportunity she's getting from Fondo Esperanza, because it will allow her to invest in her business. She reports that the training courses have been crucial for her business and also for her personal edification, since she's learned how to better organize and distribute her earnings and investments. As for the communal bank she's in, she feels very comfortable since they're close-knit and there's respect.\r\nQuilicura is a township that belongs to Santiago, capital of Chile, located in the far northwest of the metropolitan area. The town's name comes from the mapudungun (mapuche language) words \"kila\", which means \"three\", and \"kura\", which means \"rock\"; one can infer that the name Quilicura amounts to \"three rocks\". This name was given by the first inhabitants of this valley, as a reference to the three hills that are perfectly visible and define the township."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1200467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase only supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Quilicura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Transita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leslie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lloy Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1561920,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":106743},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":107466},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108192},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":108930},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":109680},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110418},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108513},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114249},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112689},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":113454},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":114222},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":115002},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":115782},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":116580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":459.43,"local_amount":214209,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":215474.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147866},{"amount":937.75,"local_amount":437220,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":439803.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381023},{"amount":1207.8,"local_amount":563127,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":566454.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988173},{"amount":745.02,"local_amount":347364,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":349416.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331124650}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T19:15:13Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":474376,"name":"Madiada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madiada, 43, lives in Kakata with her husband and has four children, aged between 11 and 29.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market, and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1198460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more fertiliser and support labor costs in the maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T02:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T02:00:13Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anualitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":776776,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":776776}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050.83,"local_amount":627894,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":635754.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382234016},{"amount":249.17,"local_amount":148882,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":150745.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399939071}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T22:39:55Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:42:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bianca Smith","image":1215503}},{"id":475623,"name":"Sagrario Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sagrario, se dedica a la venta de pupusas y sorbetes artesanal, vive con sus hijos y su esposo, el negocio se administra desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os, con un horario de 5:30 a 10:00 de la tarde, su esposo se dedica a la venta de los sorbetes este negocio lo tienen bien instalado pero necesita capital para invertir en materia prima.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de chicharr\u00f3n, harina, aceite, condimentos, y otros ingredientes que son necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de la venta, esta ayuda le brindar\u00e1 los materiales necesarios y al mismo tiempo poder aumentar su producci\u00f3n, tambien espera pueda invertir una parte en la elaboracion de los sorbetes.\n\nSu objetivo es estabilizar su condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica trav\u00e9s de su trabajo diario, a futuro su sue\u00f1o es comprarse un veh\u00edculo para poder transportarse junto a su familia.\n\n\n","en":"Sagrario sells handmade pupusas (a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans) and sorbets.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He wishes to invest profits from his farming in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo, taken recently at another maize farming plantation, shows him very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The idea for her business was born when she learned this skill with her uncle 21 years ago. After this she worked in a recycling company for 9 years and when she was left unemployed, she used her severance pay to purchase three machines but she wasn\u2019t satisfied with that. She then decided to make her work more technical so she began to study scales and patterns at The National Learning Service. At the moment her main products are Bermuda shorts, jeans and sports clothes which she sells to private customers and neighbors. She carries out all the activities of her trade in her workshop, such as cutting, sewing, finishing, ironing and packing and she sells everyday on credit. She makes her purchases in cash in fabric stores in Barranquilla city center. She is currently applying for a credikiva (her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) with which she will purchase fabric, threads, buttons, zips and general accessories for dressmaking. This investment will help her to improve her business because she will be able to fulfill her orders and manufacture women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes. She needs to maintain stock for Love and Friendship day which is upcoming and will impact her customer base. Her credikiva investment will improve her response to orders and increase her sales. Her future goal is to have a sales outlet and to purchase her own lot to build her house but the lack of money to invest in it presents her with a challenge.\r\n\r\nShe will invest her loan in women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes, fabric, thread, buttons, zips and general dressmaking accessories.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1187500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes, fabric, thread, buttons, zips and general dressmaking accessories.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60874},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63617},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65101},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66620},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68175},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69766},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71394},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73059},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74764},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76509},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81827}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":60874,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":61164.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387521},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":63617,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63920.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071399},{"amount":405.43,"local_amount":725509,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":728965.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705368}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T21:16:57Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam O'Brien","image":934632}},{"id":475682,"name":"Onide Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ONIDE ROBERTO tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad de estado civil uni\u00f3n libre tiene 6 hijos, vive con la esposa y con los hijos en la ciudad de Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\n\nEs integrante de la  Ventanilla Bendici\u00f3n de Dios se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto Rancho Grande de la parroquia Puerto Pechiche, se dedican a labores Agr\u00edcolas y Pecuarias.\n\nONIDE ROBERTO se dedica la siembra de ma\u00edz y arroz, adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de animales.

Madeleine was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both her family needs and her business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

All of them live a working class neighborhood in Sana`a, Yemen. Their community is in a rural area surrounded by the fields with the clothes markets. \r\n\r\nThe whole group requested a loan for 160,000 YER. Sadiah is 49 years old and the coordinator of her group. She has operated a business selling fabrics and perfumes for one year. She will use her loan to purchase some clothing to sell to women. Saidiah`s most important challenges are to work hard to gain extra income and to better her business structure. She is receiving a loan of 40,000 YER from AMB and, because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to expand her business with the reinvestment she makes from each loan.

He was very happy to share with us the information about his business and excited that previous season was very productive for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Xecaracoj, located in the western highlands of Guatemala. Many residents of Xercaracoj dedicate their careers to commerce (inlcuding selling produce, groceries and hardware); other villagers also make a living in manufacturing traditional clothing and animal husbandry. Xecaracoj is a rural community where many people still speak the native language of K\u2019iche.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Debora Trust Bank, Elvira is a 33-year-old married woman with two children. When Elvira was very young, her father passed away, leaving her with no other means of support. She and her siblings left school to work for family income.  Having only completed a year of school, Elvira dedicated herself to the art of hand embroidery and animal husbandry to support her family. Today, Elvira runs a small convenience store out of her house.\r\n\r\nEach month, when the Debora Trust Bank has a repayment meeting, members also receive non-formal education as part of their participation in the Microcredit Plus program through Friendship Bridge.  Elvira recently attended the advanced training for baking, and wants to incorporate a bakery into her convenience store, specializing in donuts. With a new loan she will buy inventory to enhance her store and all the materials necessary to start baking donuts.  \r\n\r\nElvira dreams of expanding her business through the bakery, which will gain her access to new clientele. She is a very positive woman who now has the self-confidence to grow her business and earn extra income to obtain her goal of keeping her children in school. In addition, she appreciates other training she has received through Friendship Bridge, including lessons on money management, which will help her with business growth.\r\n    \r\nElvira is one of 11 women who make up the Debora Trust Bank. Each have different life stories, but their common goal is to change their future and the future of their families. They are grateful for the investment that people around the world are making in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5525,"image":{"id":1197699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy inventory to enhance her store and materials to start baking donuts.

She is married to Antonio, a driver, and a father to her children. She and her husband manage their own household. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nDolores oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle unit that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business, the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, accessories and also for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDolores dreams to be able to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1198878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRencie operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy textiles from the textile factory, and sells them with a little profit. Her products are carpets, curtains, shower curtains and the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of textile items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRencie hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to have her own vehicle. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is married to Rolando who works abroad, and is a mother to her six children. She manages her household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRachel operates a trading business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a little profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Rachel is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Myra is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of textile items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMyra hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

years old and a mother of three children.  To provide the primary source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1988, having started this business with a sum of 7,000 som, spent on buying a calf.  Thanks to Syinat's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow, one calf and ten sheep, and the monthly income amounts to about 5,000 som.  The earnings from the business allow her to pay for her daughter's education.  In order to further develop her business, Syinat requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy four heifers.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and making major repairs to her house next

assistance as she would like to expand the size of her herd. She is 42 years old, married, has 3 children, and lives in the countryside. Rano has been Arvand's client since 2005 and has positively established herself as a responsive, punctual and honest woman.\r\n\r\nWhile seeking a source of income, Rano started her livestock business in 2003 with the help of her husband. Presently, she keeps over 45 large animals and 50 chickens of a good breed and sells over 45 eggs each day.

man with a huge kind heart and a beautiful soul, who lives among the tall Tajik mountains, needs your support as he has encountered financial difficulties. His name is Izzatullo. He is 55 years old, married, and raising 4 children. The climate around his home is very favourable for crop and animal farming. Izzatullo has been raising livestock for over 7 years and currently keeps several cows and sheep. He also has a large parcel of land where he grows grass for his animals. Izzatullo sells milk to his neighbours, who are happy to receive his natural dairy. Additionally, Izzatullo sells livestock after taking care of it for several months, and has many customers at the market.\r\n\r\nIzzatullo would like to develop his business but does not have sufficient funds for doing so. He is requesting a loan of US$1000 to purchase livestock in order to expand his business. He plans to use his profits to provide his children with modern technology. Izzatullo is counting on your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1203362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal
