forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nJulio se dedica a la agricultura en especial en los sembr\u00edos de palma africana desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. Este hombre tiene varias metas planteadas, pero su obst\u00e1culo siempre ha sido la falta de capital, pero esta vez solicit\u00f3 un cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para construir adecuaciones que le permitan obtener un mejor producto cosechado y menos p\u00e9rdida por falta de cuidado de sus sembr\u00edos. Con este cr\u00e9dito Julio espera que sus ingresos incrementen y as\u00ed poder dar a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n de calidad para que lleguen a ser excelentes profesionales. ","en":"Julio, 36, is divorced and has two children he helps support economically.  He lives in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeraldas Province that supplies various cities in Ecuador with plantain, cocoa beans, coffee, African palm and forest products; most of its inhabitants work in commerce to get ahead and even more so now that roads to this canton have been improved allowing for much increased commercial activity especially on weekends when all types of merchants head out to the street market to sell products to potential customers who for the most part are farmers.  Tourism is also an important income producer for this canton because its natural ecosystem is quite varied; there are waterfalls, fresh water rivers, forests to visit and there are flowers and animals to decorate this city.\r\n\r\nJulio has worked in agriculture, especially growing African palm, for five years.  He has several goals set but his obstacle has always been the lack of capital.  However, this time he\u2019s asked Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan to build structures that will make it possible to store his harvested products and lessen losses due to poor crop care.  Julio hopes with this loan that his income will increase to be able to provide his children with a quality education so that they can become excellent professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1201336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Individual members share the profits from this business.\n\nThe group now wants to purchase energy-efficient cookstoves to sell concurrently with the charcoal. This additional product offering will add to their income as well as ensure many other women in Murang'a County have access to clean cook stoves that reduce smoke and carbon monoxide and save on charcoal and firewood.\n\nThe group has taken a loan to stock their stall with cookstoves, and the group will repay this loan in 12 months.

(VEP). The group was named after a big hill surrounding a dam that supplies  water to Nairobi. In the early days of the group, the members started selling sweaters to their rural community. \n\nThe members also realized that there is potential to sell clean cookstoves, portable solar lanterns, and solar home systems. According to VEP's research, an average household of five members consumes approximately $2 of paraffin per day to light their homes. This fuel source is not only more expensive than solar lighting, but it is also polluting and unsafe. Another product offering, clean cookstoves, will reduce households' dependence on firewood by 50%. These products create savings for families, reduce negative environmental impacts, and empower the members of Ngorongo Group to earn a meaningful income.

is 48 years old. She is a widow and has 5 children. She has been a maize farmer for 20 years. She will use her Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines, like tractors, that will enhance her farming capacity. The photo was taken recently at  a previous maize farming plantation. Esperence was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The photo was taken recently at a previous maize farming plantation. Elie was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cLa Esperanza II\u201d (Hope II); it\u2019s composed of 15 entrepreneurs who work in a variety of lines of work among which there are stores, clothing sales, bookstore, plastics sales, bread sales, jewelry sales and services, among others.  All of them live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nKatherine is a member of this communal bank and in the photo she\u2019s standing in the front row first from right to left.  She\u2019s wearing a black jacket and her hair is dark brown and she wears it loose; she\u2019s also wearing a pair of white pearl earrings.\r\n\r\nShe sells second-hand, used clothes.  She\u2019s been in business six years and she comments that she works Saturdays and Sundays from 8am until 1pm because during the week she cares for her youngest son.  She sets up in the free street markets and she sells clothes for both adults and children.  The merchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago from various suppliers where bundles of clothing can be had for low cost which is an economic advantage.  She will use the loan to buy bundles of mixed clothes to stock her business.\r\n\r\nOne of Katherine\u2019s business goals is to make it grow and to perhaps be able to open a store at home to sell her wares there more comfortably.  Katherine lives with her two children who are 20 and 1 year old.  Her oldest son is employed.  Her dream at the work level is to have a home-based business to generate higher income and provide better quality of life for her children.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza is giving her because it will allow her to invest in her business.  With respect to the communal bank group she\u2019s part of she comments that very good communication exists among them.  On the other hand, the training sessions have been useful to learn new sales and bookkeeping strategies.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in the center of the country.  It\u2019s the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region; it\u2019s the most important city in the Chilean central valley.  A curious phrase exists in Chile referring to Talca: \u201cTalca, Paris y Londres.\u201d  Among the myths explaining it some say it comes from something originally said by an Englishman: \u201cTalca parece Londres,\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently blankets the city in winter similar to what happens in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1201357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She belongs to the Renacer communal bank, and this is its first loan cycle. She says that it is hard to find a responsible communal bank, so she decided to work with Vision Fund. She had been told that the credit institution was committed to its borrowers and that her group made its payments. \r\n\r\nA year ago, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe set up an Internet cafe in her house since she was no longer in school. She started a business to earn income to help her parents with her siblings' expenses. She chose this business because she is familiar with computers and has taken information technology courses. She began by doing work that students sent to her. She bought one computer, then another, and soon had three to rent and one to use herself. She is applying to Vision Fund for a loan to buy a multi-purpose printer that can scan and make color copies, since she already has a black-and-white printer. Having this printer will add business. She also wants to buy cartridges for her other printer, CDs to burn, white paper, pencils, and so forth. She dreams of having more computers because at times her customers get tired of waiting for one and she loses the business. She believes that the investment will turn out well because she wants to work hard and get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe other eight members are Rosalba, Francisca, Rosario, Mar\u00eda Elisa, Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, Juan Jos\u00e9, Elizabeth, and Jos\u00e9 Luis.

tortillas sales; and an ironworks shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1198699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

She says they gave this name to the group because they live close to a hill which name is El Cacique and they are very proud to live there, because from that hill, there's a spectacular view, since it's very high.\r\n\r\nShe is dedicated to breeding cows to sell their milk. She says her husband taught her to milk the cows, and she has had this business for over 25 years. She says that from the early hours in the day, she and her husband get up to milk the cows to sell the milk fresh. They sell from 25 to 30 liters a day, depending on the milk they get from the cows. They go out to sell to their customers door to door in different towns. \r\n\r\nShe says she is applying for a loan to Visi\u00f3n Fund to buy food, vaccines, and antiparasitics to have the cows in good condition. She has eight cows and wants to have them in good condition so the milk is of quality. She is very happy to be working with Visi\u00f3n Fund, because the payments aren't that hard. The project she has in mind is to set a small grocery store, so she will be more devoted to her youngest son and also will help him with homework. \r\n\r\nThe other 21 members of this group are Isidra, Nemesia, Laura Cecilia, Maria Teresa, Alicia, Araceli, Alejandra, Yazmin, Belen, Elsa, Ma. Guadalupe, Rosalinda, Alberta, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Rosalba, Jannet, Patricia, Tatiana, M\u00f3nica, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe y Elisenia.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is married to Jessie, a construction worker, and she is a mother to her children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRamona operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it for a little profit. Most of her products are personal products like lingerie. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. She earns a minimum of 2,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales weekly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy RTW (ready to wear) products and merchandise to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRamona hopes to be able to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1199102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional merchandise to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2781.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114784},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2780.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350841},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959946},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":555.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094660}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T09:45:25Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":476245,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonia se dedica a vender abarrotes en su tienda, ella cuenta que Finca le ayud\u00f3 a abrir su tienda, cuenta que le gusta las reuniones de su Banco Comunal, tambi\u00e9n pasa un bonito momento con sus amigas del BC, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la implementaci\u00f3n de su tienda.","en":"Antonia works selling groceries in her shop.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken was at a previous maize ground, which the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He\u2019s 56 year old and married to an adorable and lovely woman. They have two children who work and live in their own house that is located in a one of the wonderful Lebanese villages. Nabil is the main provider of income for his family. He has huge responsibilities to care for, which is why he asks sometimes for his children\u2019s support. In 2006, Nabil started to work on his own taxi.

is a conservative woman who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo, cutting wood for his carpentry business. Azhar is a 33-year-old mother of two sons and one daughter. Her husband earns only a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. For the past four years, he has been operating his business, which has been a profitable project but needs more financial support.\r\n\r\nAzhar is requesting a loan from microfinance organization FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing more wood. This will increase the capacity of his business and enable her husband to take additional requests from customers, which will improve the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Her loan request has been rejected many times because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the Irma's family is a small monthly income earned by Ruslan and George who work as timber laborers in another district. Together, they earn 300 GEL per month, which is hardly enough to provide food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma is requesting a from Credo to re-start-up her family business which she had to stop due to financial problems. She will use her loan to purchase land to cultivate wheat. Irma's goals are to plant and harvest a good quality production that she will sell at a good price to increase her family's income. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

He is a farmer and began working the land when he was 15 years old, when his father used to take him to the fields. He tells us that his father used to say to him \"The land is what produces the food for your daily bread.\" William doesn't forget his fathers advice and works full-time planting crops.

He is married to a farmer, and they have five children. \r\n\r\nHe has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. \r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken at a previous maize ground, which the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of their low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is the monthly pension of Eter\u2019s grandmother.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEter requested loan from Credo to re-start-up a family business, which was stopped recently because of the illness of the child and financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Eter will purchase a horse. Aleksandre will go to the local forest and use the horse to bring wood from the forest. They will sell the wood in the village and earn income. The wood is mainly used by the village population for ovens to heat the houses and cook. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income of the family.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNorma operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the entire working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands (cooked food) cost less than raw food.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is married to Godofredo and a mother to her children. With her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRemy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRemy hopes to give her children a good and high quality education, and she dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1199211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.33,"local_amount":933,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":972.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114789},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":4666.98,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4866.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350846},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":3733.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3892.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959951},{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":3734,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3893.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094665},{"amount":23.33,"local_amount":933,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":972.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339483837}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T01:53:44Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":476849,"name":"Nery Reyna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nery es socia de FINCA Per\u00fa desde hace 12 a\u00f1os.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Aside from this, Avelina also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20000 PHP loan. She will use the loan with her current revolving funds to buy trash from collectors.

I dreamed about this university, and it was the only educational opportunity that I had.  My family did not have the financial resources to pay for a private university.\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest days of my life was when my name appeared on the list of those admitted to the university.  From that day on I have not stopped dreaming and striving to make my dreams come true.  \r\n\r\nI now have a new dream.  I wish to study abroad.  I am interested in audiovisual productions and social work through art.  I know that studying abroad will strengthen my skills.  I will be able to return to Colombia with stronger tools in order to contribute to the film industry in my country.  Thus, I will be helping to educate audiences and new filmmakers.  I will help make images more democratic through cinema-based social work.  \r\n\r\nThe first step to achieving my dream has been to belong to the \u201cSemillero de Talentos\u201d [\u201cSeedbed\u201d of Talent] of Colfuturo in conjunction with Proim\u00e1genes.  They gave me a scholarship to further my studies in a second language, English.  Now, in this new phase, where I direct all of my efforts to achieve what I have proposed, Kiva\u2019s support is fundamental in order to continue building this dream.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to my country after my Master\u2019s, I want to continue working hard to show the world that there is talent in my country, and they can do things well.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly where my short and long term goals are targeted, to do business to support the strengthening of Colombian films.  My goal is to tell our stories, these rich and diverse stories that are found in every corner of our beautiful country.  From that point, I want to attract visibility to our valuable, necessary, and differing perspectives and to our day-to-day resistances, which are full of hope.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1204080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the application expenses for a Master's program in Script Writing and Film Direction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T18:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T18:20:13Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1480000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":1480000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1485389.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042086}],"funded_date":"2012-09-26T23:46:14Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":474202,"name":"Oum's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oum is a 38-year-old mother of ten children, eight of whom still mainly need her support as they are still in school.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Jimmy admits that having this kind of business is quite difficult to handle due to the number of competitors and factors that affect his marketing strategies. But Jimmy doesn't stop hoping and believing that everything will get better.\r\n\r\nJimmy is married and has five children. His eldest child has just finished school, while the other four are still studying. Jimmy aims to educate all his children and give them comfortable living conditions someday. So he works hard to obtain his goal.\r\n\r\nHe needs greater capital because it's harvest season, so he has requested a loan of 15,000 PHP, which will allow him to buy necessary merchandise that will increase his sales and profits. He knows that this loan will help him provide quality service to his customers. It will also encourage more customers to buy the merchandise he offers. In this way, he can let his children finish their studies and give them comfortable living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1064116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo taken was at the previous maize ground, where the borrower will still use for this new season. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives in the municipality of Santa Rita, in the department of Yoro.  Six months ago, Elba left her business selling consumer goods, and decided to sell fast food such as: \"baleadas\" (flour tortillas stuffed with beans, eggs and cheese), fried chicken with bananas or corn tortillas, and snacks such as churros, sweets and other items.  She has set up this business in her house, which is on the side of a road. \r\n\r\nElba is requesting a loan of 10,000 Honduran lempiras to stock up her business with snack products and basic groceries, and to buy supplies to make her meals.  With this investment, she can maintain her inventory and increase her sales and income.  Elba's goal is to always have the resources for the daily support of her family, so that they can have good opportunities.

After much hard work and dedication, and her mother's support, Lizbeth started her small business selling and hiring dresses.

They said that the group is called that because the majority of the members are artisans who work with clay, so they named themselves that so that they would be easily identifiable. Petra is a very hard working woman with a strong hope to get ahead. She told us that she earns a living selling seasonal fruit and vegetables in the market in an area close to where she lives. She has a garden that produces avocados, peaches and loquats. She said that the loan that is currently pending through VisionFund is to buy flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, yeast, and fire wood for her wood burning oven to make the bread, because she also makes money selling bread by going house to house and to people who place orders. A part of the loan will also be used to buy fertilizer for her trees.   \r\n\r\nShe said the loan will be beneficial to her because it will allow her to have raw materials to make her bread and to improve the conditions of her trees. With the profits she makes she will be able to give her family a better quality of life. Her goal is to increase the size of her garden, to depend less on the profits from her bread since baking is very time intensive, and that way she would be able to spend more time with her family.  \r\n\r\nThe other six group members are  Eusebia, Imelda, Elia, Elia Mart\u00ednez, Claudia y Quirino.

In addition to managing her own business and taking care of her home, she has worked as a cook at the Environmental School in Horquetas, Costa Rica since 2010.\r\n\r\nShe started her business three years ago in order to build her savings and support her children in their studies.  Currently she lives with her children and her husband. She started with the salary she was making as a cook at the school in Horquetas.    Her previous loan helped her to develop and strengthen her business, which has been growing ever since. She repaid this loan punctually.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking this second loan so that she can diversify the products that she offers to her customers. This will enable her to meet her customer demand for new products, which will in turn help her to increase her income.  She has placed an important order for dress shoes and sports shoes for men and women.  She needs to pay the bill within 22 days in order to maintain her credit.\r\n\r\nShe also sells clothing and household products through catalogs.  She divides her time in the mornings between getting her children ready for school and working in the school dining hall.  In the afternoons, upon returning home, she sells products and collects payments from customers.  On the weekends, she travels to San Jos\u00e9, where she buys merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer business has a growing base of customers -- to date she has approximately 50 regular clients.  She sells her products at the school and in her community to neighbors and relatives.  She intends to introduce the sale of shoes, but this requires capital; thus she is seeking this loan.  She has customers that will buy these shoes, but her supplier has not given her credit on a long-term basis.  This loan will enable her to grow and improve her product offerings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1203133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives in Pakistan with her husband, two sons, and four daughters. One son is a police officer, and her husband is a taxi driver. His income is insufficient to meet the family's needs, so Samina is trying to help him fulfill their needs by stitching clothes. She is a tailor, and wants to generate more income by purchasing a new sewing machine. She will buy a new taxi for her son, if she gets a good amount of profit in the future. \r\n\r\nSamina is a member of an eight-person group, and has requested a loan from KIVA partner, BRAC Pakistan. She plans to purchase a sewing machine to sew more dresses, and to satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally. She hopes, with the help of the loan, to reach her desired net income and be able to save for their future. She prays for her children's better future.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream in life is to go for an Umrah (pilgrimage).

Above all, the group is always very respectful.  It is comprised of six very hard-working women, who, in addition to their household chores, are entrepreneurs.  Each one of them has a productive business activity.\r\n\r\nThat is why they are requesting a loan from the institution.  For example, Paulina, Elvira, Gloria, and Romualda buy sheep to raise and fatten.  They are later able to sell them.  Mar\u00eda will invest in dairy products to stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\nThe group members do not know why its name was chosen.  The people who started the group are no longer working with the institution.  Nevertheless, they believe that it is because the place where they live has many small springs.  These are very helpful to the inhabitants when their community does not have potable water.\r\n\r\nElvira is a member of the Manantial group.  She tells us that she is 33 years old, and she has been married to Melquiades for 15 years.  Together they have formed a family with six children, three of whom go to the community school.  Elvira explains, \u201cI have always lived in the community.  Ever since I was little I have seen all of the community\u2019s customs like the dishes that are eaten, the holidays that are celebrated, the typical clothing, what is grown, and what is raised.  Also, through the years I have seen how all of this is being forgotten.  What I have learned from my community is raising animals like the sheep that I have at home.  I have three sheep, but I am thinking of buying five more and fodder.  I started this business activity individually five years ago.  The person who helped me a lot to be successful in my business activity was my mother-in-law.  She taught me important tips in order to be successful.  The only difficulty I encountered is the lack of information about how to take better care of my sheep.  Many times they get sick and die.  I would like to get training in order to know about this issue.\r\n\r\nThis time I will use the loan to buy wood to improve and enlarge the sheep corral.  I only have three, and if I buy five more sheep, they will not fit.  All of them together will be very uncomfortable.  I bought my sheep when they were little in order for them to grow and fatten so that I could later sell them for a better price.  When they are bigger and fatter, the pay is better.  In order to achieve all of this, in the mornings I clean the corral where they sleep.  After that I give them dried grass to eat, and I provide them with water. \r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, after my children get home from school, I feed them.  Then we all go to the plains for my sheep to graze.  This is what I like the best because my children play soccer there, and they have a lot of fun.  This way I take care of my sheep and my children.\u201d  When we asked her what her goal is, she smiled and said, \u201cFixing my house because I don\u2019t want it to leak like a sieve.  When it rains it gets very wet, I do not know how to control the leaking.  My goal for my children is for them to complete their studies, and earn a professional degree.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1202982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to improve and enlarge the sheep corral.

cerdos y dos reces en la actividad tengo ya 17 a\u00f1os de experiencia, inicie mi negocio porque ten\u00eda que obtener otra entrada de dinero aunque trabajo como obrero muchas veces la familia necesita otras cosas y es por eso que me decid\u00ed criar animales ya que es una actividad muy buena que se puede desarrollar muy bien en la comunidad, pero tambi\u00e9n inicie porque ten\u00eda un amigo que me invito a criar animales y me motivo mucho porque desde al principio me ofreci\u00f3 una tanda de cerdos que tenia para m\u00ed y se  acepte y as\u00ed fue como empec\u00e9 a criar animales, es por eso que estoy solicitando un nuevo cr\u00e9dito con la instituci\u00f3n para comprar alimento para cerdos para engordar a sus cerdos, es una dificultad por la cual estoy atravesando la falta de dinero para comprar m\u00e1s alimento pero gracias al cr\u00e9dito el podre comprar el alimento, hace tiempo yo llegue  a tener  cerdas grandes que pod\u00edan darme hasta 25 lechones

problemas con mis animales, dos cerdas que estaban a punto de parir perdieron todos sus lechones por salta de atenci\u00f3n, llegue a perder 50 lechones en un mismo d\u00eda, si mis cerdos que tengo en casa y mis reces crecen en muy poco tiempo podre vender mis cerdos a muy buen precio con atenci\u00f3n y que est\u00e9n muy bien alimentados en cuatro meses podre recuperarme en la misma cantidad,

Construction started to happen on top of the tracks and now just parts of them are still visible.\r\n\r\nFelipe is the group representative and he relates that he\u2019s 54-years-old and only studied up to fourth grade in elementary school.  He married Mar\u00eda and they formed a family and had children.  Currently, though, they only have one son left at home who is attending school and a granddaughter who is also in their care.  Felipe relates that he has worked raising animals and at the moment has only seven pigs and two heads of cattle.  He has 17 years\u2019 experience in this activity.  He started it because he had to find another source of income because even though he worked as a laborer often his family needed other things and that\u2019s why he decided to start raising animals which is a very good activity that can be developed well in his community.  But he also got into it because a friend invited him to raise some animals and that motivated him very much because at the very beginning he gave him a litter of pigs that he\u2019d set aside for him and he accepted it and that\u2019s how he started to raise animals.  \r\n\r\nThis is why he\u2019s asking for a loan from the institution in order to buy feed for the pigs to fatten them up.  The lack of cash to buy more feed is a difficulty he\u2019s going through at present but thanks to the loan he will be able to buy the feed.  Some time ago he reached the point of having large sows that produced up to 25 piglets.  He did very well and one day he was asked to accept the position of delegate and he accepted but it absorbed too much of his time and he started to have problems with his animals.  Two of the sows that were about to give birth lost their entire litters because of lack of care.  He lost 50 piglets in a single day.  If the pigs and cattle he has at home now grow well in a short period of time he will be able to sell the pigs at a good price.  With good care and being fed well he\u2019ll be able to recuperate and reach the same number in four months.   He wants his animals to grow and he wants to have much more so that his children can continue going to school because he wants them to have careers where they can develop professionally.  Felipe is a very hardworking, responsible man.  All he wants is a better quality of life for his family.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and Celia are part of the group; they also raise animals and will also invest in Felipe\u2019s animals because this is a shared activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1203001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-26T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-26T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":265},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4648.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.66,"local_amount":538.83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":551.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120019},{"amount":195.01,"local_amount":2463.34,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284808},{"amount":9.82,"local_amount":124.04,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":126.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595947},{"amount":227.51,"local_amount":2873.79,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-30T09:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2938.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663575}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:33:10Z","paid_date":"2013-05-30T09:10:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":476954,"name":"Sara Lizette","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara, de oficio comerciante, habita en la ciudad de Managua , de profesi\u00f3n contadora , pero debido a la escasez de trabajo , se dedica a atender un negocio de pulper\u00eda y fotocopiadora.

She relates that she\u2019s been working with Visi\u00f3n Fund loans for several cycles and she\u2019s done very well because she\u2019s improved her poinsettia growing and selling business\u2019 conditions.  She comments that she\u2019s had this business for five years and she\u2019s very proud of her business because it\u2019s given her much satisfaction like being able to develop as a businesswoman.  She says that she started this business because her husband and she did not have stable jobs and she requested a loan to buy what was necessary, like the structure and the plastic sheeting, to set up a nursery.  They decided on that particular business because her husband had already worked as a day laborer caring for nurseries and they decided to have one of their own.\r\n\r\nShe relates that the first year they only planted a few plants because they had no one to sell the plants to but gradually as the years have gone by they\u2019ve acquired customers; this is their sixth consecutive year of planting and selling this beautiful December plant.  She says that they are now planting different varieties like Suljibri, Freedom, Pink Marble, Marbell, Star, White and Sonora.  The flowers are already attaining their color and in the month of November they will be ready to be sold at wholesale to her customers.  \r\n\r\nRight now she\u2019s asking for a loan to buy manure, insecticide and paper to wrap them for sale.  She hopes with the loan to increase production a bit more because she\u2019ll  be able to give her children a better quality of life that way.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She lives in her own house together with her 4 lovely children, for whom she wants the best quality of life. Marina is a hard-working woman and she likes the country lifestyle. Sixteen years ago she started working in the cultivation of coffee plants, which she obtained with a lot of hard work. During the harvest she usually requires the help of day-workers so that they can easily pick the fruits. For Marina, the most difficult thing is when she is unable to fight the plagues which affect her coffee production. For this reason she found out about MFP loans, and she did not hesitate in approaching a consultant. Now, thanks to the support she can carry out her planned work. This is her third credit, and she promises to make her repayments punctually. She supports her communal bank for its good organization.

","en":"Jos\u00e9, 60, has made a living selling books for the last 31 years. With his business, he has generated enough income to keep up with the expenses of his family, which today is composed of his wife and three children, aged between 12 and 36. \r\n\r\nHis business consists of the sale of technical books, encyclopedias, and other books of general interest. His sales are conducted in cash and sometimes credit, done directly at his workplace. His principal clients are professors and students who come to him to order the books required for their professional educations. Jos\u00e9 many times does not have the ability to respond to them immediately due to growing demand. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason for which he is looking to a Credikiva loan, the first financing he will do through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy books to be sold in his sales site located in a prestigious university in the city. Jos\u00e9 has developed many sales strategies to boost his book sales, such as used book auctions. He purchases the used books at very low prices from the students themselves when they finish each semester, and resells them to those beginning the semester. \r\n\r\nHe owes everything he has learned about book sales to a friend of his, who one day asked Jos\u00e9 the favor of buying books to stock up his business, but Jos\u00e9 was tricked and had to remain working in the business at the request of his friend.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

He lives in his own house and is single. He has grown coffee for quite a long time, since from childhood his father taught him everything about this work. He produces organic coffee that he sells to the regional union of Huatusco. Miguel also works seasonally as a day laborer with other people to thus have an extra income. For Miguel, his parents are the most important thing. What he most wants is to help them advance. For this reason, he has decided to apply for a loan to improve his coffee farm with the purchase of fertilizers, to buy plants for renovation, and to pay for labor to care for the plants so that he can obtain a good harvest that will make it possible to improve his income as well as his quality of life. After the harvest, he would like to remodel his house so that his parents can live more comfortably."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1204033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy coffee plants and fertilize his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T02:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936744}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T08:37:09Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":477434,"name":"Darwin Felix","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Darwin es un joven de 21 a\u00f1os, tuvo la oportunidad de terminar la escuela primaria, vive con su padre Segundo, quien es alba\u00f1il y tiene 57 a\u00f1os.

Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante.

","en":"Darwin is a young man of 21 who had the opportunity to get through elementary school and lives with his father, Segundo, who is a  57-year-old brick mason. They live in the Boliche neighborhood of the city of Latacunga, capital of the Cotopaxi province, which is part of the Andes region of Ecuador. Cotopaxi has developed to such a remarkable extent in recent years that it has become known as one of the most important provinces of the whole region thanks to its floral, mining, metalworking, agricultural, and cattle industries. What's more, there are many businesses investing their growing profits back into this commercial city and offering many opportunities to get ahead. Latacunga is a charming city that attracts tourists with its narrow colonial streets and architecturally interesting churches that preserve their facades of years past. \r\n\r\nDarwin makes cement blocks that are used as bricks for constructing houses. He learned this trade very young, led by his older brothers. Now, Darwin has been in this trade for 3 years, spending 8 hours every day without help. This line of business is very active in the city and the province generally, so the competition is increasingly strong. Nonetheless, Darwin has decided to increase his capacity so he can earn a higher income. That's how he came to learn about financial institutions that help young entrepreneurs and requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa [Kiva field partner], which, in addition to providing financial support, also offers advice on how to improve his business. Darwin hopes that his business will come to be known as one of the big cinderblock suppliers so he can realize his dream of having his own home. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1203909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies to increase the capacity of his business.

El y su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos en las edades de 13 a 25 a\u00f1os, vive al suroccidente de la ciudad, en un barrio que poco a poco sale de la informalidad de sus habitantes, quienes son principalmente trabajadores independientes, con grandes sue\u00f1os de salir adelante, mediante la educaci\u00f3n de su familia.  En la actualidad necesita surtir su negocio porque la demanda de los art\u00edculos que ofrece crece cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s y sus inventarios no resisten tanta solicitud, por su insuficiente capital de trabajo para responderles y hacer que su negocio crezca. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual se acerca a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para solicitar un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a esta organizaci\u00f3n, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres, bebidas y c\u00e1rnicos, para obtener descuentos y aumentar sus ingresos. En su negocio Benjam\u00edn realiza las ventas de contado y se desempe\u00f1a en su labor comercial, de lunes a domingos, con pocos descansos; las compras las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y de contado a distribuidores de sus productos, que le hacen buenas ofertas y le ofrecen oportunidades de acceso a art\u00edculos, con descuentos y a cr\u00e9ditos. Su meta mas adelante es hacer reparaciones locativas a su negocio, porque \u00e9l esta esmerado en hacerle a sus clientes un ambiente confortable, cuando le van a comprar  y finalmente tener una casa propia,  lo cual es muy seguramente uno de sus grandes desaf\u00edos.   ","en":"Benjamin, 52, owns a store where he sells snack food, supplies, soft drinks, and general household items in small amounts that his customers can afford. He and his family, made up of his partner and their 4 children, ages 13 to 25, live in the southwest of the city in a neighborhood that is slowly but surely emerging from the informal economy of its residents, who are mostly independent workers with big dreams of getting ahead through their families' education. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he needs to stock up his store because what he offers is in more and more demand every day and his inventory can't keep up with that pace due to a lack of the working capital he needs to make his business grow. That's exactly the reason that he's gotten involved with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Kiva field partner] to request a Kiva loan, his first from this organization, with which he will buy home supplies, beverages, and meats in bulk so as to receive discounts and increase his earnings. \r\n\r\nAt work, Benjamin is busy manning the cash register and attending to his business from Monday to Sunday with few breaks. He makes his purchases on credit and in cash from suppliers that can offer him deals and opportunities to buy items at a discount. His most pressing goals are to make certain repairs to his business, as he's focussed on providing a comfortable environment for his customers when they come in to shop and, ultimately, to have his own home, which is definitely one of his main struggles.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1204009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy home supplies, beverages, and meats for sale.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is impacted by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

All of the members are from the city of Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. M\u00f3nica, a group member who is seated in the photo fourth from the right in the front row with a lilac jumpsuit, has made a living selling assorted salads for the past 12 years. She says she works Wednesdays and Saturdays, selling in the streets and other times at flea markets, her schedule depending on availability. She buys her merchandise and supplies at the commercial center where farmers bring in their products, where she finds fresh vegetables at low costs, which is financially beneficial. With the loan, she plans to purchase olives, cabbage, lettuce and carrots to stock her business. One of M\u00f3nica's goals is for her business to grow and to have a store where she can offer her products so she can generate more income and thus improve her quality of life. M\u00f3nica lives with her husband and their three children, two of whom are in school and the oldest of whom is working. Her dream for work is having her own store, and her familial dream is to have her own home since they live on her mother's land. She is very content and grateful for the opportunity provided by Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza, which has allowed her to invest in her business. Furthermore, she feels comfortable with the fellow members of her community bank, because the different activities and interests serve as a welcomed distraction. In respect to the training she has received at the group meetings, she has learned to better administer her business. Concepci\u00f3n is seated at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River, one of the largest in the country, in southern Chile in the region of Biob\u00edo. It has played an important role in the nation's history, being sight of important battles and treaties, especially during the Arauco War (a long-running conflict between colonial Spaniards and the Mapuche people). Currently the city is undergoing an important economic and demographic development to come to be considered one of the most relevant urban, demographic, administrative, financial and commercial centers in Chile, after Santiago and

Her business began 6 years ago, and it is a sales point or variety store where she sells many retail items, such as feminine accessories, items for the home, perfume, and paper goods, among other items. She makes her sales on credit or for cash, while she makes her purchases in warehouses and china shops which sell to her in larger quantities and where she is able to obtain discounts when she buys a larger volume. Her principal clients are the neighbors in the district where she is located, who satisfy their shopping needs in Eilsa's business without having to travel to the commercial centers, incurring expenses. Her goal for the future is to expand her retail structure and have the opportunity to provide her children, who are the reason for her dedicated and persistent work, with their own home. She is now applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy a display case and a refrigerator to sell ice cream and merchandise for the day of love and friendship [February 14], a season in which she increases her sales and earns a little more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1204037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For the past two years, Imedal has been working hard to manage her tailoring business.  \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Imedal has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy materials for making clothes for resale, and will help Imedal to generate greater profits and improve the capital in her shop. Imedal hopes that in the future she will be able to develop her business by having different fashion styles of clothes for customers. \r\n\r\nImedal is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

I need to buy two milk-cows to produce more milk and thus have more products to sell and increase my income, upon which my family depends. I am requesting the loan to achieve this objective. I feel very happy about having this local loan opportunity, and at a good time!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1204055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

He will use Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production: He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He works growing vegetables and raising chickens. He\u2019s had this business idea since he was young and living with his parents who taught him a lot of what he knows. Four years ago a friend gave him farm land that he uses to grow the products he sells today, like onions, cilantro, cabbage, eggplant, and chickens which he sells in local shops. Fidel prepares the land for planting, waters it, and harvests after 45 days. His sales are made in cash, but he always needs money to invest. Right now he\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan that he will invest in cultivating onions, cilantro, cabbage, garlic, and eggplant. In order to do that he will buy seeds, soap, hoses for irrigation, and feed for the chickens. With this investment, his business will be able to increase yield and improve income, and this allows his work to be consistent and of a good quality. With this funding he will be able to increase yield and get more customers. His goal is to get into new markets, impressing new customers in the stores and in the markets with the freshness of his product. His dream is to have his own land and so that he can face the challenges of the lack of rain and large amounts of money.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

In the past she took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to renew her work area and make her work experience more pleasant. Having successfully repaid the loan, she now took a new loan to buy a sewing machine, an over lock machine and an A\/C unit. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi
