She joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are bad debts and a lack of enough funds to run the business. She believes these challenges can be partly alleviated by this loan.\r\n\r\nFlorence is applying for a loan of 27,050 KES to buy vegetables and fruits in wholesale. The extra income from the loan will be added to her savings to pay the school fees for her children and improve the living standards of her family. Her dream is to see her business expand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1199639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is married and has three children. She owns a grocery shop, a business she has been operating for 10 years.\r\n\r\nGrace learned about Milango through friends who invited her to the group. She joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations.

Juntos viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Gualea, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana conocida como Los Yumbos. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque.

The family lives together in a rural parish, in the city of Quito, the capital of Ecuador.  The parish is called Gualea and it is in the north-west of Pinchincha province which was home to an Ecuadoran culture known as Los Yumbos.  This area boasts a diversity of flora and fauna, as well as rivers and waterfalls which are crystal clear and attract both domestic and international tourists.  Locals make the most of this opportunity to offer tours, accommodations, food and outdoor sports such as horse riding, etc.  Other common businesses in the area are livestock raising (for meat and milk) and the farming of sugarcane, cassava, maize, oranges, mandarins and papaya.  Hand-made crafts are also a good business opportunity here and the goods are in demand because they use natural materials such as seeds.  As a result of all this, the local authorities have worked to install adequate systems so that all of the 2,000+ inhabitants have access to basic services.\r\n\r\nEdy has the opportunity to develop the livestock-raising business that he learned from his parents and which he has been working in for the last 26 years.  Every day, he gets up very early to milk his cows and goes out to sell their milk to his customers.  He works for eight hours, sometimes more.  Edy sees Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa as offering an opportunity to grow his business because they provide support to the rural community through loans and training.  He requested a loan to buy more cows so that he can increase his production and thereby improve his income and cover all his children's needs because, one day, he would like to see them become top professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1204036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He sells his food directly to the customers who eat it.  He makes his sales every day, for cash.\r\n\r\nDeimer makes his purchases in the public market in Barranquilla.  He is always looking for suppliers who offer the best price and quality.  His goal for the future is to own his own premises so that he no longer has to pay rent.  His immediate goal is for his children to finish their studies and his biggest challenge is supporting them financially until he achieves this dream.  Deimer is currently applying for a Kiva loan which he will invest in buying raw materials and supplies in larger quantities.  He will buy oil, cassava, potatoes, maize and meat, and also a galvanized metal counter.  With this investment, he plans to improve his business structure and lower his costs so that he can earn more money and improve his family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1204137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Cambodia, Chea is a 63-year-old married mother of four children. The main source of her family's income is from rice farming, which she has engaged in for forty-three years in order to overcome her family's financial harship.

Her wages are not sufficient for her to provide for her 4 young children because her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation. Obida needs new sources of income. To that end, she studied in a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate.\r\n\r\nObida wants to set up a business in buying and selling cattle, since she has experience in this field.

Her family is made up of her husband and six children, ages 26-40; she dreams of their success.  With 32 years of experience and great creativity, Dennys has managed to help with the household income and support herself in the market.  Her enterprising idea was born because her spouse had a large food business where she learned to make many of the products she sells today.\r\n\r\nIn 1985 she decided to start a restaurant with the help of her three brothers, but it only has existed since a year ago, when she started to sell exclusively catalogue products and converted her restaurant into a fast-food business where she sells \"salchipapas\" [fried potatoes and sausages], hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, and other tasty foods that she combines creatively for the enjoyment of her customers.\r\n\r\nDennys has adapted a space in her house where during the Christmas season she sells cold meat for the Christmas Eve family dinner.  She also sells beauty products.  She makes all her sales directly, so her customers come to her business or she visits them and sells for cash and credit.  She buys her food supplies in delicatessens and her cosmetics from large distributors who give her a catalogue periodically she she'll sell their products.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are employees, factory owners, neighbors, and referrals who know her and make requests every time they need something.  Among her long-term goals is adapting a space for her restaurant to offer her customers a comfortable and air-conditioned ambiance.  She also wants to separate the business from her house so she can have more quiet for herself.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's applying for a Kiva loan to buy merchandise such as perfume, cosmetics, household items, creams, and beauty products.  Dennys projects that her business will improve with this investment because she'll have products available to expand her clientele, because she has bills to collect and sometimes she doesn't recover them.  It's not enough to satisfy her customers' requests, especially for the Day of Love and Friendship [third Saturday in September in Colombia], a big sales period for her.\r\n

She sells dishes such as: hot dogs, hamburgers, pizzas and other delicious combinations. She first had the idea for her business when her husband was working at a fast food restaurant, and she was observing the food industry process. Shortly thereafter, she decided to start her own adventure in food sales, and began selling hot dogs from a rented cart. As business began to grow, Susana added a second cart to her operation, and also started selling pizzas. Since she has learned how to prepare and make all her food dishes, she decided to buy an oven to broaden the scope of her operations. Gradually, as her business kept growing, Susana slowly added tables and chairs to the area around her stand so that she could accommodate more customers. Today, her's is a popular, well-known food stand that also delivers to customers' homes. She accepts cash payments for food items, and operates her stand Thursday through Sunday every week. The other days of the week, she goes to Barranquilla to purchase food from delis to stock her food stand for the rest of the week. \r\n\r\nSusana's goal is to grow and strengthen her business, and to continually improve the quality of her food and the products she offers to her customers, most of whom are from nearby neighborhoods and areas. She tries to constantly add new ingredients and be creative with her dishes, and she always makes an effort to treat her customers and suppliers very well. Susana promises to make punctual payments in this, her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She plans to use the support from this loan to purchase food for her stand, including: hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, sausages, french fries, breads, sauces, etc. She hopes that this investment will help her to improve her business and offer a wider variety of products to her customers, leading to increased sales.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1203216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase hot dogs, hamburgers, sausages, pizzas, french fries, bread, sauces and other items for her food stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60874},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63617},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65101},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66620},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68175},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69766},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71394},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73059},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74764},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76509},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81827}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":60874,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":61248.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387535},{"amount":440.98,"local_amount":789126,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":793975.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928213}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T17:32:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":477923,"name":"Pingdataaba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme IRENE est  responsable du groupe PINGDATAABA.

In addition, there are business establishments that generate notable incomes, converting it into a commercial city with various opportunities to get ahead. Latacunga is a welcoming city that attracts tourists with its narrow, decorated, colonial streets and its architectonic churches that conserve the typical facades of past years.\r\n\r\nLuis sees an opportunity to expand his cattle-raising activity, which he was taught by his parents, starting in early childhood some 20 years ago. Each day, he invests 2 or 3 hours in the most demanding activities while his wife is responsible for the general care of the animals. Luis combines milk-producing activity with raising pigs for later sale.\r\n\r\nLuis approached the Fundacion Alternativa hoping to expand, and seeking the help it offers the rural sector with loans and training opportunities. He solicited a loan to buy more animals and increase milk production. In this manner, Luis hopes to improve their incomes so that, later, he can make his dream of having his own house a reality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1204158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy more cows and increase milk production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Rodrigo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":511.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":127.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":129.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":131.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.97,"local_amount":122.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382695},{"amount":131.04,"local_amount":127.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":131.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989778},{"amount":137.66,"local_amount":134.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126184},{"amount":130.33,"local_amount":126.91,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":130.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516786}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T17:14:49Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":475300,"name":"Benard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benard used his previous loan amount to buy more stock of goods to sell in his retail business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

It has been a profitable business, which sustained her even before her husband passed on. She is also thankful for her children's contribution to paying her expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a 50,000 KES loan to buy chicks and chicken feeds. She hopes her sales will increase so that the business will grow. She enjoys this business because it is not too involved and gives her time to spend with her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1200010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He would also sell food items to colleagues and teachers. \nGordon\u2019s passion for business developed further when he started an enterprise known as Churchill Inc., based at his boarding school in Ghana, producing and selling post cards and wristbands. As CEO of Churchill Inc., Gordon employs eight people and has solicited orders from 25 schools so far. With the income generated from Churchill Inc., Gordon managed to raise funds to buy 2,000 textbooks along with pens and pencils for 1,000 primary school students after he saw that they lacked these basic resources. \n\nIn addition to running a successful business at school, Gordon assumed numerous leadership roles including  dorm prefect, personal assistant to the General Secretary of the Students Representative Council, and the Student Representative to the Council for his class. \n\nHe was also the Production Manager of the Pope John Junior Achievement Company at his high school and an active member of the school\u2019s Olympic Club, through which he successfully organized the school\u2019s 41st inter-House Athletics Competition.\n\nGordon would like to expand the work of his company Churchill Inc. to create employment in Ghana and around the continent. Ideally, he would like to use the enterprise to support the less privileged in society.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1203202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gordon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748410},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735293},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614226},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629750},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668060},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159797}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T20:03:25Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":477472,"name":"Blanca Azucena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Blanca tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 4 hijos quienes son independientes, vive en el municipio de San Manuel Cortes y le acompa\u00f1a sus dos sobrinas, la dem\u00e1s familia viven en el extranjero.

Jordan has used his strong leadership abilities and entrepreneurial mind-set to address some of these problems in Uganda.\n\nIn an effort to reduce litter and waste materials that collect in \u201cchannels breaking the water system and causing soil degradation,\u201d Jordan constructed a chicken pen made solely from recycled water bottles, which he collected, filled with sand and arranged together like bricks. This has been standing for 6 months. The remaining bottles were used to pack liquid soap for people wanting to buy it in small quantities. Jordan now runs this operations as a small business.\n\nWhen his community was required to retrieve water from a well as a result of a blocked drainage system rendering regular tap water unusable, Jordan took charge of the situation by ensuring that all of the stagnant water was removed.

She is passionate about social entrepreneurship and helping those who are less fortunate. A prime example of this is a project she worked on involving refugees near her home. Noticing that the refugees did not interact with others in the community because they could not speak English, Sharon started a program to address the language barrier.  She located space, recruited two volunteers, and started providing English classes for the refugees and immigrants in order to \u201ccut communication barriers with their neighbors.\u201d\n\nAnother example of Sharon\u2019s innate desire to help others came about in her role as leader of the Apostolic Faith Mission Youth program. When she noticed a young orphan in her community who needed looking after, Sharon took it upon herself to write to the church to ensure that the orphan was taken care of.\n\nSharon\u2019s strong leadership capabilities were recognized when shortly after moving to a new school, she was elected as treasurer and chief organizer of the school\u2019s commerce club. Other leadership roles she occupied in school were debate team captain and president of Academics for her Students\u2019 Representative Council. Academically, she was the best student in her school and held this position for the past two years. \n\nSharon displayed courage and resilience when, despite losing her brother a few days before a math exam and Olympiad, she took the experience as a motivational one to encourage her to strive harder and perform well. From this experience, she has learned that \u201csome situations are meant to be catalysts to make you achieve greater success.\u201d She explains that one should \u201cnever allow any knock down to be a knock out; find strength to get back.\u201d\n\nSharon wants to build an orphanage to shelter vulnerable children who have lost their parents. This is because she believes that \u201cwhen a child has the right kind of support, love, and comfortable home living, it gives him one less thing to worry about so that he can concentrate on his studies and make a difference.\u201d  In the next 20 years, she also hopes to build a \u201cvictory empowerment house to help people who are violated of their rights\u201d and become a motivational speaker to help people discover their inner strength. \n\nShe is passionate about bringing about positive change on the continent and  hopes \"every African has access to education and primary health care, good sanitation, and running water and sleeps with a filled stomach.\u201d\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1203231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748414},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735297},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614230},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629754},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668064},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159801}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T18:51:15Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":476770,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary, a wife and mother of four in the Mukuru informal settlement of Nairobi, is ready to change her life.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her cafeteria, where she sells natural juices, soda, sandwiches and some snacks. With this loan, she will invest in her business by increasing her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe lives in a simple structure with her four children and her husband. She says her most difficult challenge has been to improve her business and introduce other products and services. She also added that Thanks to the Lord and these loans she has been able to increase her economic activities. One of her favorite things to do is work. Ana is excited about her fifth loan with Esperanza. She will use the profits to improve her business. Ana thanks all of you for your support.

Elmira works as a teacher in a local school and by way of additional income, she has practiced animal husbandry for the last 14 years. She started this business with 10,000 som. Thanks to Elmira's hard work, she currently has two milk cows with offspring and two horses in her stock. In addition, Elmira tills 2.55 hectares of land with potatoes and sainfoin for the cattle to eat. Thanks to the income from the business, Elmira is able to pay for her youngest daughter's education. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the further development of her business, Elmira appealed to the company \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cattle for fattening up and reselling. Elmira plans to use the income from the loan to further increase the quantity of her livestock in order to pay for education tuition as well as to build a fence, which she plans to do this year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1204325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kojoyar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25248.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012443},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":25248.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743610}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T22:02:21Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:32:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":475395,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is 24 years old from Ndunyu Njeru and is a single man.

Her business plan started in 2006 as a way to help her husband financially to cover the family expenses and not depend on him for her personal expenses.  As the years went by the store grew, in sales and in customers.  This is why her profits, infrastructure, and equipment of nine display cases are superior to when she began.\n\nHer customers are her neighbors, friends, family members, and passersby, to whom she sells in cash and on credit.  She makes her purchases in cash in specialty stores in the downtown of the city.  Although the competition is tough, she supports herself with good prices and credit adjusted to the needs and possibilities of her customers.\n\nOver a period of five years she has received four loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Her dream today is to have her own house, educate her daughter, and convert the variety store into a large department store that is better known in the city.  Her greatest challenge is the liquidity to respond opportunely to customer demand.\n\nCurrently she's applying for a Kiva loan to invest in buying, wholesale and in cash, products such as footwear, clothing, toys, and gifts for special occasions such as the Day of Love and Friendship, a season in which her sales pick up and she generates more income to benefit her household.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1204165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She belongs to The Solidario Group, which is made up of two members who have different businesses in the municipality of Juticalpa.  Nora is the group's coordinator and she sells silver accessories for women. \n\nFive years ago, Nora followed the example of one of her neighbors and decided to start selling cosmetics through catalogs.  After a few years, she decided it would be better to sell accessories.  Her business does not have a name because she does her selling on foot and occasionally at her home when her neighbors or friends come to see her.  The greatest difficulty Nora faces is the weather, as the temperatures in these months are very high.  It is also difficult when she sells her merchandise on credit because sometimes they take a long time to pay her.  The loan Nora is requesting is to buy raw materials to make some designs and accessories, and to buy current, trendy styles.  With the help of this loan she will be able to stock her business with more and different products to satisfy her customers' different needs, which will allow her to increase her earnings.  Nora has been a client of FAMA for 7 loan cycles and has always been punctual with her payments.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1084691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelsy Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6598.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387913},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T09:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6598.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372430},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T10:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6598.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981357},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6598.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331965068}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T05:20:54Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:31:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":470002,"name":"Sionith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yamilet, tiene la edad  de 33 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada,  vive con su esposo y dos hijos actualmente.

She belongs to a group called \u201cGardenias\u201d and she says they named it thus because the house they meet in has gardenias and to quickly identify it they gave it that name; besides it\u2019s a very pretty flower.\n\nShe relates that she\u2019s had a grocery store for more than 28 years and that she opened it to help her husband with household expenses because there used to be more children to support who at that time were attending school.  She also opened a small grocery store because of need; there wasn\u2019t any grocery store where they could buy basic staples for personal use and to eat.  \n\nShe says that she wants a loan and is asking Visi\u00f3n Fund for it in order to stock the grocery store because she wants to buy soap, eggs, milk, chlorine bleach, fabric softener, beans, rice, tuna, sardines, cookies, toilet paper, disposable diapers, soft-drinks, juices in assorted flavors, etc.  She says that she buys all those products in various stores in a nearby town where she gets them at low prices so that she can earn a bit of profit when she resells them.\n\nShe says that her greatest dream is that her youngest son has a career and is able to improve himself because stable employment is scarce in the community where they live; he still has two more years left in high school.  She also wants to make her business grow a bit more and to sell dairy products and cold cuts so that folks don\u2019t have to go to other towns to buy what they need for their meals.\n\nThe other seven group members are Domitila, Natalia, Gabriela, Enriqueta, Martha, Laura and Sebastiana and they will use their loans to buy products to stock grocery stores, to make traditional clothing and to buy sheep feed.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1200371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-27T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-27T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enriqueta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":57000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4053.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4316.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4409.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4504.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4601.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4700.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4802.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4906.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5011.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5120},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5230.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5343.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":314.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":335.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":364.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.48},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":992.03,"local_amount":12778.72,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":12815.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392153},{"amount":706.93,"local_amount":9106.19,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9132.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120015},{"amount":737.76,"local_amount":9503.37,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9530.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068063},{"amount":769.94,"local_amount":9917.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":9946.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284804},{"amount":803.52,"local_amount":10350.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10379.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199124},{"amount":414.82,"local_amount":5343.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5358.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595946}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T03:52:44Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":478111,"name":"Awadagbe Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"AWADAGBE est un groupement de seize personnes, dont les membres r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame village.

Additionally, Baken owns 3 hectares of land which she uses to grow potatoes, barley and cock's head. All together, her business has a monthly revenue of 12,000 soms. \r\nIn hopes of expanding her business, Baken approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" requesting a loan of 75,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase livestock for future fattening and resale.

He\u2019s lived in Cali for the last 11 years.  He arrived there with his mother seeking employment and a better future.  Completing his university studies meant that there are no impossibles for him and that academic preparation is the path that leads to all sorts of goals.  With much effort and work he was able to skillfully deal with economic needs in order to finish his studies.  He initially worked selling books door to door, as a clown puppeteer and as a party entertainer.  He then worked at the university as a monitor in the audiovisual esthetics classes.  Later, given his skills, he worked as an audio and video editor in the social communication production center.  He graduated and started his career in the audiovisual field.  He\u2019s the son of a single mother and has a teenage sister.  Jahiber sees himself in the future studying in the United States for a Master\u2019s Degree in Cinematography and hopes to get help from Kiva because this is his only available alternative to do so.\r\n\r\nThis is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the first time I went to the movies.  I was about 7-years-old and my mother and grandmother who were devout Catholics took me to see \u201cThe Martyr of Calvary\u201d starring Enrique Rambal.  I felt such strong emotions in that enormous, dark room that I felt like Jesus himself; I cried my eyes out and it was as if I had been crucified too.  In fact, I retained some of the dialogue that I\u2019d later recite at home annoying my grandmother who eventually would end up laughing.\r\n\r\nToday, as I recall that event, it makes me smile to see how the roads I\u2019ve taken and the decisions I\u2019ve made in life have led me behind the cameras, to know and love this occupation that generates so many experiences and emotions.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished high school it was unthinkable that I\u2019d be able to attend university because my mother had exhausted all her efforts to provide schooling for me and my younger sister had just recently arrived in this world so my mother said to me quite clearly: \u2018Son, this is as far as I can go helping with your schooling.\u2019  This newsflash generated just one thought in my brain: I had to work to be able to continue studying.  Well, this did not happen because despite my effort to secure employment in some firm or other all I ended up doing was spend money to print copies of my curriculum vitae, on transportation costs and in filling out job applications.  Worn out by this situation and motivated by a girlfriend who was getting ready to apply to the Universidad del Valle, I got a glimpse of the dream of becoming a professional.  Years later, after many jobs and much study, I was graduating from an excellent university not only with a professional degree but also committed to a lifetime career as a cinematographer.  I also won an important prize: the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Award for Best Cultural Television Production for writing and directing my first documentary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, my eyes and my heart are set on getting a Master\u2019s in Cinematography in the United States and Kiva\u2019s help is a fundamental part of the application process.  I am totally convinced that through it I will have the necessary tools to return and contribute to Colombia\u2019s social and cultural development through cinematography production.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1204103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay application fees for a Master's in Cinematography.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-28T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-28T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jahiber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1214000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":101166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1214000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1214002.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042087}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T01:46:27Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":475417,"name":"Opetela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Opetela is 25 years old, married and has 1 child.

Her economic activity is a small shop where she sells basic grains, candies, and sodas, and it is located in her home. She has nine years of experience in the business. Lucia is a hard-working woman, responsible and self-satisfied. \r\n\r\nPreviously, she had a sewing workshop with a total of seven machines where she worked for 30 years. However, for health reasons and doctor's recommendation, she had to leave the business. Then, with her children, she decided to start a small shop. Now she has nine years in the business. She started it with her own little money, with the goal to improve the household income and, as a single mother, get her children ahead. Today, all her children are independent and her family burden is lighter. \r\n\r\nShe needs the financing to invest in working capital and stock her small shop to meet customer demand. Lucia del Carmen is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders provide to business people with limited resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua.

He lives in the city of Ica in the district of Santiago with his wife and little four-month-old baby.  He's a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife devote all their effort to getting ahead.  Unfortunately, for lack of financial resources and for the need to work to help his mother, he couldn't finish high school or study in a graphic design program, although he very much would like to have done so.  In his free time he likes to play soccer with his friends, and occasionally he makes a delicious Lomo Saltado [stir-fried beef and fried potatoes] to share with his family.\r\n\r\nThrough his own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Renan works as a construction worker.
