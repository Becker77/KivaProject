Their aim is to have a distribution shop for both charcoal and firewood energy saving cookstoves.\n\nAlongside the cookstoves they will also sell charcoal and pieces of firewood to create a one-stop shop for their customers.

However, Stephen's working capital has often been insufficient to meet his goals of improving his prosperity.\r\n\r\nStephen is requesting his first Kiva loan through Yehu Microfinance Trust to purchase sacks of green vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions.

Besides this, she also sells charcoal.\r\n\r\nFrida learned about Milango through friends who invited her to the group, and she joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are high transport and fuel prices, seasonal weather and finding customers. Frida is applying for a loan of 96,600 KES to purchase another motorcycle.

Because she now sees potential in raising livestock, she would like to diversity into poultry farming.\r\n\r\nMary was introduced to Milango by her friends and is applying for a loan for 104,800 Kenyan shillings to buy chicks and chicken feed.

She is married and has one child. She owns a retail shop for selling juice, bottled water, sweets, etc., and her business has been operating for two years. Saada started the business through her personal savings. \r\n\r\nSaada learned about Milango through friends who invited her to the group.

He's in a common law marriage and has a 9-year-old son. He comes from the town of Chinandega. Chinandega is known as a thriving commercial area; it's a border area, which facilitates the trade in Chinandega. Justino's business is taxi services, which he has been providing for 12 years in the town of Chinandega. He has both casual and regular customers, such as company employees. He acquired his taxi cab many years ago as a result of his own efforts. He had been working abroad, and with the money he brought back he was able to purchase his taxi, which has been his and his family's livelihood. Justino has already worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 before, and he has proven himself to be responsible with his repayments, both in terms of time and form. The challenges and hardships that the family has faced in the business are a few mechanical flaws in the engine of his taxi, which is the reason why he's requesting the loan. His dream for the future is to keep on working hard and eventually buy another taxi cab.

He will use the funds from CEPRODEL and Kiva to increase the inventory of merchandise he has in his store.  The business is currently being run by his daughter, because Manuel suffers from an illness which is causing him a lot of pain in his extremities and constant fatigue.  This is why he stopped working.  Because he has been very ill, his daughter has been running the family business.  Manuel's illness has had a financial impact on his family, because he stopped directly earning income from his source of employment.  Manuel thinks that his illness was caused by his many years of working in a factory as a machine operator.\n\nManuel is married, and he has 4 children.  He is still responsible for 2 of them, 1 of whom is still in school.  Manuel started his business with his own capital, selling candy.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nClaudia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Claudia also has a barber shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Claudia is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nClaudia hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Aigul, as the main income earner for her family, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union began selling shoes at the market, starting virtually from scratch. Thanks to her hard work, Aigul generates about 15,000 som per month, which is the basis to cover the cost of food and household needs for the family. Revenues from her business allowed Aigul to increase her involvement in agriculture, particularly animal husbandry - her flock consists of 15 sheep.\r\n\r\nIn order to further the development of her business, Aigul turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of shoes for the upcoming season \u2013 warm shoes, insulated boots and sneakers.  Aigul plans to invest income from the loan in further expansion of her business and is planning to send a portion of the proceeds to help build a house for her son.

As the main source of income for her family, Almakul has been engaged in raising livestock and growing crops since 2000, started with only 6,000 som (KGS). Through her hard work, her activity generates about 5,000 som monthly, which is the basis for covering the cost of food and household needs of the family. Almakul also cultivates 4.90 hectares of land with wheat, beans, vegetables, and perennials. \r\n\r\nRevenues from her business allowed Almakul to educate her children. In order to further develop her business, Almakul approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som for the purchase of wheat seeds and mineral fertilizers, since autumn sowing produces a better harvest in the spring. Almakul plans to invest income from the loan in further growth of her business. A part of the income is planned to be saved for the training of her youngest daughter Saule.

She is a widow. With the help of her children, she manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJocelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Jocelyn is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn hopes her business would continue to grow and dreams to have a good life.

Thanks to her warm welcomes and the good quality of the dishes she offers, and especially the practical prices, she has acquired a considerable customer base, which is more and more demanding.

He is a merchant and has opened a small ready-to-wear clothing store, which he has been running in a district in the capital for two years already. His warm welcomes, his creativity, his good fashion advice, and his experience have earned him a rather large customer base. \r\n\r\nThe growth in his customer base poses a problem, since he no longer manages to satisfy all his customers due to low capital funds, which compels him to go to the outlets each weekend to buy retail and then come back to make his sales.

What she buys has a fast turnover, which causes her working capital to regenerate quickly and increase her profits. Having good customers increases the recovery of her capital and thereby her earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1200939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

In order to do this business he pays a person to help him load and unload the rocks.  \r\n\r\nLuis now needs the loan in order to buy more quarry rocks to sell.  The money will be a help because he will invest more in the business, and he will have more income.  This way he will get together more money to make more improvements to his truck.\r\n\r\nLuis says that when he pays back this loan, he will take another in order to invest more in the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1207079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy quarry rocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-09-29T00:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-29T00:00:25Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Antonio \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":44.44,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":44.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443969},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":44.44,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048919},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":44.44,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":44.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006074},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":44.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":44.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568842},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":44.44,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":44.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118466},{"amount":45.33,"local_amount":45.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":45.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531091},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":43.55,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":43.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573042},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":46.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":46.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165777},{"amount":42.83,"local_amount":42.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":42.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971613}],"funded_date":"2012-09-29T22:40:43Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":475965,"name":"Mogga Sam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mogga is a 25-year-old businessman who lives in Juba.

He tells us that he does not have much schooling and that his family has always been in the business of driving taxis.  He drove one of his father's taxis for several years and saved up, as his goal was to buy his own taxi so that his earnings would be free and so he could be independent.  After a little over ten years of work he was able to get his own taxi.  He works every day from eight in the morning until eight in the evening and he does not take days off, as holidays and weekends are when he has the most work.  He tells us that over the years he has acquired many customers and he even goes to their front doors when they call him.  He says that his work is nice because he knows all the people in his town and he has made good friends in addition to offering a service and earning money.  He will invest this loan in some parts and tires to maintain his taxi and thereby offer his customers better service.  He hopes that with this loan his business will prosper and his earnings will increase so that he can offer his wife a better quality of life and, in the future, he hopes to be able to invest in another taxi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1206608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to perform maintenance on his taxi by buying parts and tires.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Palma Cuata, Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-29T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-29T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6301.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":6473.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":6827.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":7108.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":7448.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7840.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":491.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":504.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":532.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":611.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":491.38,"local_amount":6301.68,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6302.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392161},{"amount":504.76,"local_amount":6473.28,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6474.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120023},{"amount":532.39,"local_amount":6827.58,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6828.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068071},{"amount":554.31,"local_amount":7108.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7109.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284811},{"amount":580.8,"local_amount":7448.34,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7449.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199127},{"amount":611.36,"local_amount":7840.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7841.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595950}],"funded_date":"2012-10-14T06:57:44Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:01:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":475998,"name":"Lona Seluwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"lona  is 34 years old and a businesswoman who lives in Juba.

Eliza produces cheese and sells it in the village. The family's average monthly income is GEL 150. It is not enough to provide Eliza and her daughter with normal living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEliza requested a loan from Credo to start her family business. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for a business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Eliza will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. She will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard, raise them, and sell them for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She tells us that she enjoyed very much working with the institution and that is why once again she requested a new loan. Eva lives in a small municipality called Ixtlahuaca, which means \"uninhabited land\". This is a very nice area with a large plaza where vendors sell clothing, vegetables, fruit, shoes, etc. on Mondays. \r\n\r\nEva is 32 and has been married to Juan Carlos for six years. They have four children, three of whom have not yet started school. Eva has four salons in Ixtlahuaca. She started her business because she studied styling and then started working. She greatly enjoyed tending to her clients, and so she decided to open her own salon. Afterwards, bit by bit, she opened the other salons. The salon which she herself tends to, and where we did the interview, has been open for seven years. During the interview, she told us that the last loan helped her a lot because she was able to buy the supplies to work for awhile without worrying a shortage of supplies. \r\n\r\nThis time, she is requesting a loan to buy new of dyes and treatments that she is launching. She also wants to buy flat irons and hear dryers and perhaps new furniture.  \r\n\r\nIn her business, she does not see any difficulty by which she has to worry about. She is doing very well. Nevertheless, Eva commented 'I would be very happy to have more products to have more clients, the products many times are very costly.  If my clients come to me for treatment, having more products allow me to perform without any difficulty because I have the material available. With my profits, I can improve the quality of life for my children and ensure their educational welfare'.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1206958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

For the past three years, she has operated a clothing retail business in her neighborhood. She is well known in her community and new customers typically come and seek her out. Laureine has one son.\r\n\r\nLaureine has requested a youth loan to purchase clothes, perfumes and other accessories for resale. She used to import these goods cheaply from Syria but the fighting there has caused her to import from Beirut instead. Prices are now more expensive than they used to be. This loan allows her to purchase winter clothes and school clothes for the coming season. She will pay this loan back over the coming year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1201085,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2752,"youtubeId":"iwApQYHO0VA","title":"Kiva Borrower Laureine from Lebanon","thumbnailImageId":1201085},"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"to buy clothes, perfumes and accessories for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Ain Al Helwi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-09-29T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-29T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laureine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310155},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918460},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440455},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993145},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735754},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846377},{"amount":336,"local_amount":336,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":336,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614611}],"funded_date":"2012-09-29T05:09:47Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":476036,"name":"Manana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manana is from the small village of Sachkhere district.

The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they run a small dairy farm of two calves and two milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production.

Manana works hard, but the family still doesn\u2019t have enough income to save and use to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nManana has applied for this loan to increase the number of cows and renovate her house. With the requested loan she plans to purchase an additional milk cow. This will allow her to produce more milk from her dairy and increase her sales, which provide her main income.

She completed secondary school and is married to Ruben, with whom she has 4 children. She says that she learned to work at a very young age by completing household chores. However, she wanted to work at a job that would allow her a bit of money to contribute to household expenses since the financial situation became worse every day and there was not enough money. \r\n\r\nFour years ago, with her husband's help, she opened a small grocery store in her home. This has worked well because she has many customers. She said, \"Now that I have my business, I always look for the best way to stock it so customers find what they need, and so they return to shop here again.\" The aspect Camila likes most about her work is working with people daily and attending to her business without neglecting her family.\r\n\r\nCamila will invest this loan into buying rice, beans, sugar, salt, candy, drinks, canned goods, flour, toilet paper, and toothpaste to restock her business and continue her sales.

She has a 24-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter.  She dreams of her daughter becoming a successful professional.  Magaly has owned her own business for the past five years.  She started her business after having worked for several years in a school and also in a small business.  She was keen to start working independently, so she decided to make the most of her culinary experience and the fact that she is a good cook and start making cakes to sell to her neighbors.  Her customers paid her every two weeks when they had money from work.  This business went very well and she later decided to make the most of her existing customer base and satisfy more of their needs and wishes.  A friend recommended that she started selling catalog products.  She put a lot of effort and enthusiasm into this new business and experienced really good results.  She now sells both cosmetics and cakes and her customers are not only her neighbors but also other people who they have recommended her to. \r\n\r\nMagaly's current goal is to fill the orders that her customers have placed for 'love and friendship day' (the Colombian equivalent of St Valentines Day which is celebrated in late September).  She is requesting a Kiva loan so that she can fill their orders in a timely manner because the challenge she faces is that she doesn't have enough working capital to do this.  Magaly will use her Kiva loan to buy products such as shampoos, massagers, creams, soaps and makeup in larger quantities.  She will also invest in buying supplies for making cakes.  With this investment, she plans to fill her customers' orders for 'love and friendship day' and this is one of the reasons she will be successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1204161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Local dance traditions are also alive and well here.  The festejo, lando, zamacueca and other dances are typical of this area.  Carmen likes to listen to music in her spare time.  She also tells us that she likes a popular local dish called \"juane\".  She would have liked to have studied economics, but she wasn't able to finish school because her family didn't have the money to pay the fees.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a small beauty products business.  She also works 9 hours a day at a \"fundo agricola\" [not sure--a food processing plant, perhaps?].  Some of her co-workers there are also customers of her beauty products business.

She started out with only one small glass display case, selling jewelry and perfumes.   Later, she started buying more merchandise such as accessories, clothing and silver jewelry.

This will allow him to offer a better selection for his customers to buy and improve the quality of his work, which will improve his income positively and ensure him a bright future. Khalil is photographed in his store. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She already has had a number of years running her business and it is going very well since she has increased the number of customers and she always tries to stock her stand with seasonal fruit, which help increase her sales.  Tania says that she sells more during the season of zafra (when the indigenous people produce sugar) in order to make a little more money.  \r\n\r\nA credit from VisionFund will give Tania the opportunity to buy a variety of seasonal fruit such as watermelon, melon, pineapples, papaya, bananas, oranges and mandarines.
