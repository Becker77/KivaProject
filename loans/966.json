He is a rickshaw driver with a low salary which is the only source of income for him. It is not enough to cover his costs of living.\r\n\r\nMostafa wants to improve his income and his standard of living by purchasing his own rickshaw. He is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new rickshaw to use for transporting goods from one area to another on customers' requests. This will increase Mostafa's capacity to work extra hours and enable him to take on additional internal requests, which will improve his income and ensure him a better future. \r\n\r\nMostafa is photographed next to the rickshaw he will buy.\r\n\r\n<u>About Shariah-compliant lending:<\/u>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She applied for a loan of five hundred thousand shillings to top up and pay school fees for her daughter, who has been admitted to a university.  \r\n\r\nMiriam engages in several small businesses, including poultry and agriculture.  She also runs a kiosk in the market where she earns her daily income.  She deals with food and soft drinks.  Miriam's problems include limited capital to run her business and lack of skilled knowledge to run her poultry farm's daily farming practices.

She is single and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past five years, Sumaya has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells beans, sugar and rice. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sumaya has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more beans, posho (maize flour), bread and other goods, and will help Sumaya to generate greater profits and improve her standard of living. Sumaya hopes that, in the future, she will be able to be a good entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nSumaya is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small-scale entrepreneurs like Sumaya who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1202603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a hardworking and an independent woman who is living in Punjab, Pakistan, with her husband, two sons and two daughters. Both of her sons are doing jobs, while her husband is a gardener by profession. But his income is not enough to fulfill his family's needs and to meet household expenses. Since 2004, Neelam herself has been running a livestock business; her younger daughter helps her as well. Now she wants to grow her business by purchasing two more buffaloes.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, as a member of seven-person lending group, she has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan.

The family's average monthly income is 300 GEL ( Georgian Lari: 1 GEL = .60 USD). It is not enough to provide Tinatin and her family with adequate living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTinatin has requested a loan from Credo to re-start her family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up, and re-start-up with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income, and they often do not have access to credit. With the credit, Tinatin will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. She will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard, She will raise and sell the chickens for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the

He is living in a southern part of Kosovo in the Ashkali community. He is married and has three children between the ages of three and eight years old. Two of the children attend school currently. \r\n\r\nAvdush works as a lumberjack, cutting wood. He provides woodcutting services to those in his community in order to provide heat during the cold weather. He had originally started working together with his uncle; however he has now managed to work by himself. As a result of separating from his uncle, Aydush needs a loan in order to purchase a saw for himself. Through his work he helps his family and gives them everything they need.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngelina operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 Philippine in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelina hopes to have a deeper relationship with God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Teresita is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

Theresa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Theresa hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1203446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T01:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T01:00:17Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.
