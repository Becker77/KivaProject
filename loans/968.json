is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nTisiya was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nTisiya is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum. and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nDisplaced from her home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when she was just a small girl, Tisiya grew up in the Kyangwali refugee camp in Uganda, where she endured unspeakably poor sanitary conditions, battled malnutrition, and witnessed extreme human suffering. Instead of resigning herself to a life of misfortune, she saw in Kyangwali the opportunity to do tremendous good.\n\nTisiya has always believed that education is the key to success and in the refugee camp started study groups to help other village students with their studies.  As a solution to the shortage of textbooks for the students, Tisiya formed discussion groups for each class level and selected group leaders for each based on their academic aptitude (to assist weaker students) and their age. On weekends they gathered in larger groups, and Tisia often taught these classes. \n\nIn her hostel in the refugee camp, Tisiya acted as the academic prefect and head girl, overseeing approximately 100 fellow students. She also managed a small hostel library to ensure that the 80+ students who lived in the hostel benefited from the few books provided to them.  She also served as a counselor at her secondary school to help and encourage students to overcome hardships they faced in school. \n\nTisiya is passionate about helping African culture to \u201cupdate\u201d itself so as to \u201cmove with the fast changing world,\" while maintaining pride in its rich and varied culture and traditions. When Tisiya\u2019s grandfather passed away in her refugee camp, she realized that younger people were losing essential information about Africa\u2019s history as elders in her community continued to pass away.  She created a group in the refugee camp called the Voyager Team with other students who share a passion to learn more about Africa. Tisiya thinks it is important to learn about traditional African history and pass it on to generations to come. \u201cWe are getting first-hand information that builds us and we share it with other youth. By realizing that ancient Africans did great things, youth are able to believe in themselves and accept that that they can do even greater since the world has much more opportunities through modern technology,\u201d Tisiya explains.\n\nIn 2007, Tisiya passed primary school with a First, becoming the first girl to get the First in the history of the Kyangwali refuge settlement in Uganda\u2019s national examination.\n\nTisiya is passionate about leading positive change in her community. She wants to be a leader and face issues of instability and poverty, so that there can be peaceful communities.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1207767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tisiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748415},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735298},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614231},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629755},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668065},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159802}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T19:54:19Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":474249,"name":"Aster Hankam 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pulse (mobile phone minutes) is a necessary for every person.

pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nRahinatu was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nRahinatu is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nRahinatu comes from Salanga, Ghana and is one of a family of six.\n\nRahinatu is passionate about the value of education and making a difference in her community. Noticing the high occurrence of teen pregnancy in her community, Rahinatu sought to educate peers on the implications of pregnancy and the value of education. With the help of the Ghana education service, she spoke at a forum encouraging girls to stay in school and avoid pregnancy. \n\nRahinatu\u2019s leadership capabilities are evidenced by the numerous leadership roles she assumed at school in Ghana, where she was girls\u2019 prefect and a member of the Debating club, HIV\/AIDS club, and the Maths and Science club. Academically, Rahinatu has also excelled greatly, winning the Presidential Award as the best female in the northern region for the 2011\/2012 school year. She also won the regional debate competition. \n\nRahinatu plans to become a gynecologist in order to look after the unique needs of women and their health. She decided on this particular career path after seeing how understaffed a particular hospital was when it comes to helping women in labur.\n\nRahinatu\u2019s vision for Africa lies in access to education: in twenty years\u2019 time, she wants to make sure that all African children have access to education. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1207769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahinatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748416},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735299},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614232},{"amount":251,"local_amount":251,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":251,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629756}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T20:41:52Z","paid_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":473206,"name":"Debora Ernestina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Debora es una persona muy trabajadora que tiene un negocio de servicio de comida con el cual genera los ingresos para el sostenimiento de su hogar donde convive con sus 3 hijos.

is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nRellikson was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nRellikson is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nRellikson hails from rural Kenya. His particular village has only two poorly built primary schools, with few instructors and limited teaching materials.  Noticing the extremely low academic performance amongt the village children, Rellikson took it upon himself to do something about the situation. He launched a tutoring program, dedicating his weekends to mentor students in his district and volunteering as a teacher two days a week for the past three years. As a result of Rellikson\u2019s tremendous efforts, the academic performance of these students increased tremendously and some were even admitted to provincial schools. Rellikson continues to support students academically by writing an INSHA book (composition and essay in Kiswahili) \u2013 a guide book for primary school students to improve their writing skills. \n\nRellikson\u2019s passion for community service was also evidenced by his dogged determination to address the problem of water-borne diseases facing his village. A proactive and pragmatic leader, Rellikson realized that the high rate of water-borne diseases in his village was largely due to the lack of toilets. Rellikson sought to address this problem by digging pit latrines and encouraging others in his village to do so. He has since recorded a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from cholera, typhoid, and dysentery in his village \u2013 a remarkable feat from the efforts of a single young boy.\n\nAcademically, Rellikson has achieved extraordinary results. He was the first student in his district to join Alliance High School, one of the best high schools in Kenya, and holds as many as twenty academic certificates. Rellikson\u2019s natural ability to lead others in his community was formally recognized by the numerous leadership positions he held at his school, including class prefect, chapel praise and worship leader, and dorm prayer coordinator. He was also a Sunday school teacher in his community church, and he was invited to be a motivational speaker and teacher at his primary school. \n\nRellikson is very interested in the field of medicine.  He hopes to impact Africa by seeking practical solutions to address the problems of poor health services and widespread diseases on the continent. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1207770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rellikson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748417},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735300},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614233},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629757},{"amount":168,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668066}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T22:22:22Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":473208,"name":"Jose Abad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose trabaja en la calle vendiendo productos de uso personal desde hace 12 a\u00f1os, cuando decidi\u00f3 dejar la actividad de la agricultura por motivos ajenos a su voluntad.

pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nUkeme was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nUkeme is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nUkeme comes from Ikpot Ekpene, Nigeria.\n\nDespite his young age, Ukeme has an innate ability to lead others and is passionate about positively impacting his community. Recognizing the need for a decent road in his community, Ukeme single-handedly spear-headed a project for the construction of a new road despite having had no formal training or expertise therein. In his spare time, he filled empty bags of cement with sand and would lay them in major holes on the road. He then added timber during the rainy season and constructed a gutter to encourage water flow. \n\nDespite initial skepticism from his community, Ukeme was able to get other members of the community to assist him in constructing the road. After some time, Ukeme and his fellow community members had managed to successfully construct a road fit for use by vehicles.\n\nUkeme is also a budding entrepreneur. During school, he established and maintained his own restaurant business. He sold sachets of water to earn money to start up the restaurant business, and he made contacts with traders so he could obtain food items. In Nigeria, Ukeme would sell food items very early in the morning and on Saturdays so his business would not interfere with his academics. The business started as a small store beside his house where he sold small food items, and in time it grew to the point where he could rent a space near a school campus for his business.\n\nAs Ukeme\u2019s restaurant became more successful, his family became involved in the preparation of food items and he even now has two additional employees who work at his restaurant. The revenue from Ukeme\u2019s business contributed to the payment of his school fees and also provides money for a separate youth organizations that Ukeme runs. \n\nUkeme aspires to impact Africa by establishing Africa\u2019s first continental health organization, similar to the WHO, but with a unique focus on medical development in Africa. Through this organization, Ukeme wants to reduce the high mortality rates throughout the continent and also reduce the high number of maternal deaths.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1207772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ukeme","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748418},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735301},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614234},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629758},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668067},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159803}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T00:53:03Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":479458,"name":"Chidubem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chidubem is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nChidubem was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nChidubem is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nChidubem comes from Abuja, Nigeria and is one of a family of six.\n\nAt school in Suleja, Nigeria, Chidubem\u2019s natural ability to lead others was recognized by his extensive involvement in a number of clubs and societies as well as the numerous leadership positions he held.

is a 19-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders.\n \nChantal was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nChantal is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nChantal is an orphan and comes from Rubavu, Rwanda. \n\nDespite the hardships she has endured having no parents and coming from difficult living conditions, Chantal strives to achieve the best in everything that she does and is dedicated to creating a better future for herself and children in similar situations. Passionate about helping other orphans, Chantal wants to work as hard as she can so that she will be in a position to help as many orphans as possible and \u201cmake them not worry about their loss.\u201d\n\nChantal is an extremely motivated and persistent young woman and has demonstrated a steel resolve when it comes to achieving her goals. When her father passed away last year, Chantal struggled to find financial support for her school fees.

His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is what Hamlet earns working as an artisan in the village.  Hamlet requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan programs extend to the country rural poor business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions.  These families do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Hamlet will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. Hamlet will sow different kinds of greens and tomatoes to sell at a good price. This will increase the income of his family.

However, he hopes to find a way to buy one more plot of land.  He is currently raising money for this purpose.  When he is not occupied planting, he works in a machine shop.

Claudia del Carmen is the coordinator of the community bank.

She takes her merchandise both to her regular customers and any others who she sells to on credit collecting payment by-weekly which is the customary way of collecting payment in this country.\n\nShe intends to use the loan to invest in working capital and buy merchandise like clothes for children and adults, sandals and cosmetics.  \n\nClaudia states that in a not too distant future her dream is to see her children become professionals and to have a general store to sell her merchandise in and thus have a less demanding work routine since her current way of working is very demanding because she has to wander the streets under the hot sun all day.  \n\nThey thank Kiva lenders for the help they give small merchants of limited resources and from poor countries like Nicaragua to have a

He has taken care of them for three years in the house in the community.\r\n\r\nThe job this exemplary son does is raise sheep of the Jun\u00edn breed, which is his main specialty because he learned how to take care of them and breed them.  He has rancher customers who buy his sheep for their herds, especially males for breeding.  \"This job is my main entertainment,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHe also studied computer engineering, and now he's working in that field in a Peruvian state hospital.  He receives a monthly salary that allows him to support his family's financial stability because he helps his mother with the household expenses.  One of his plans is to continue studying and open a solid business that will allow him to support his expenses over the long term.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to Hacienda Communal Bank and this is his fourth loan with MFP, where he's happy because he receives everybody's help, which allows him to continue in his business.  He also promises to make his payments punctually because his bank is made up of responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nJhossy will invest the requested money in buying sheep of a good breed to energize his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1196029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhossy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529127}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T00:38:35Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":473282,"name":"Hernan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Hernan es una persona muy trabajadora indican varias personas de su zona, el esta separado hace mas de seis a\u00f1os de su pareja, actualmente vive solo, hace dos a\u00f1os que \u00e9l trabaja en la localidad de puerto villarroel, se dedica a la pesca, cuenta con un peque\u00f1o barquito de pesca con un motor fuera de borda que se compro de segunda mano, \u00e9l se levanta a muy tempranas horas por la ma\u00f1ana para ir a rio arriba y as\u00ed poder pescar los mejores peces y poder comercializarlos en el pueblo, vive con sus dos hijos, cabe se\u00f1alar que sus hijos son personas casadas e independientes, \u00e9l es muy feliz alado de sus nietos pero \u00e9l se esmera para tratar de llevar una vida mejor junto a su familia, el necesita mejorar sus herramientas de trabajo y as\u00ed mejorar su desempe\u00f1o en la pesca","en":"Various people who live near Hernan said he is a very hard working person.

The products which Feliciana and Juan have been able to cultivate with much will and enthusiasm have helped them very much in making progress in their lives.\r\n\r\nThey have been doing cultivation for 14 years and they always rely on the support of laborers who help them with the harvest and weeding of the cacao, coffee and citrus fruit plants.\r\n\r\nThanks to these plants, she has been able to improve her quality of life, since in selling her crops to the distribution centers she makes good earnings because of her good collection.\r\n\r\nWhat she most enjoys about her work is caring for her crops and she feels very happy when she sees them large and leafy. However, her challenge is transporting the heavy sacks from the farm to the distribution centers since they are located an hour from her plot of land.\r\n\r\nShe will continue to work normally but her priority is to finish the construction of her home, since she is building it from quality construction materials.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan.

Vanna fully repaid back the past loan which helped him relieve his family\u2019s burden. Now he is leading his group of two to seek a loan of 200,000 KHR each.

To feed her family, Khoeun farms rice on one and a half hectares of farmland, a business that she has been involved in for 11 years, and raises 600 heads of duck, a business which she has been involving for only 3 years. Her main challenge is having insufficient working capital to support her business. She is now seeking a loan in the amount of 1,010 USD. This will be her first loan with VisionFund. Some portion of her first loan will be spending on covering the expenses on the rice field such as buying fertilizers and rice seeds, while the other portion will be spent on buying feed for her ducks.

She is a 59-year-old married mother blessed with one daughter and three sons. Some of her children are assisting in their mother\u2019s business, which is selling grocery items, whereas the others are working as paid workers in Korea. Kheun earns a living by selling grocery items and has been involved in this business for 30 years. To supplement the income, Kheun\u2019s husband also plants rice and sesame.

children. For daily decent food for her children, she grows paddy rice and vegetables. She has had experience in this business for 12 years and is able to earn about 11,000 KHR per day. Her key challenge is the low production where the flood occurs. For this cycle, Sor is a second-time borrower with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. The original loan, which she has paid back completely, has helped her to sustain her business gradually and better support her household. Therefore, she was able to manage to buy a decent motorbike for commuting and shipping her vegetables. Now, she wants to expand her business. Hence, she formed a group of three female members to seek a microloan. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for her paddy field and vegetable garden. She hopes to double her income and therefore attain good progress on her living

It is the only business that she has been with for 12 years. For her business, drought remains the main challenge. \r\n\r\nAs a third-time borrower with VisionFund, Savuot is also a group leader in a group of two.

She and her children live with her parents and a brother who also has his family living there.\r\n\r\nCelfita is a street vendor and sells bags.  Every day she gets up early and goes to the market to offer bags to shoppers.  She works in the markets closest to her home or in the crowded streets where there are many customers.  She is very loved because of her charisma and good customer service.  She has been in this business for nine years and works alone since the children are still in school, even though they do help her sometimes.  What she likes about her work is that she has free time, is independent and can do other things.  She knows that her work is the only income for the family, so she must get ahead despite any adversity.  Fortunately, she has fixed customers that she has gained over time so she earns a good profit.  She wants to continue progressing economically to give her family a better lifestyle.

To endure family adversity, she and her husband do rice cropping as the main source of income. To raise up extra income, they also raise pigs and sell firewood in that area. For 12 years, she has been able to earn about 33,000 KHR and save about 18,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nIncluding this cycle, it is the second cycle for Dy with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). She has paid back the past loan with success, which has enabled her to manage her business properly and buy household materials. Now, she leads a group of two for the new requested loan. As a group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy additional piglets for raising.

She has had this business for over 3 years. She works with the help of her mother and together they work to please their customers with the best delicious flavours.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLike any woman who wants to improve, she has many goals but the main one for now is to get her food business together. For this she hopes to make a large space within her house where she can carry out her work peacefully and provide a better-quality service.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is her third credit with MFP, and she is grateful to all the people who have made the loan possible so that she can continue to carry out her work with better results. On the other hand she promises to make her repayments punctually as she did with her previous loans. She is also grateful to be part of her communal bank because the members are responsible and very caring. With the amount she is asking for of 1000 sol she will buy fruits, ingredients, supplies and materials to continue carrying out his work.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1198792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits and ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T13:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.54,"local_amount":311.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":323.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447609},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":164.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053507},{"amount":68.42,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188445},{"amount":70.96,"local_amount":177.41,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":184.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572364},{"amount":72.66,"local_amount":181.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":188.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122027}],"funded_date":"2012-10-03T07:50:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"KAROLINA KOSZELSKI","image":1085659}},{"id":474998,"name":"Zacarias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL SE\u00d1ORA ZACARIAS,  TIENE 44  A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, SOLTERO VIVEN EN LA COMUNIDAD DE QUEBRADAS DE LA  PROVINCIA  MIZQUE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE COCHABAMBA,   LLEVA UNA VIDA SOLITARIA  YA QUE NO TIENE HIJOS COMPARTE SU VIDA CON LOS PARIENTES MAS CERCANOS COMO SER SU HERMANA Y SOBRINOS, QUE LOS COLABORAN EN LA PRODUCCI\u00d3N SEG\u00daN SUS POSIBILIDADES.

She has four children in total, but only one son is under her responsibility as he is a student. To sustain her household, Sambath grows paddy rice and raises pigs while her husband helps with the rice farm and provides his threshing service for a fee. Sambath can earn about 20,000 KHR per day from the current business which she has been with for 12 years.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth microloan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). The past loan, which she has paid back, has gradually provided support to her business with a decent income. For this cycle, she is seeking 1,400,000 KHR while her co-member is seeking 1,000,000 KHR.

Her husband, Felix, is a farmer.  The couple have 6 children, two of whom--Freddy, 37, and Carlos, 19--live with them.  The rest are independent of their parents.  The family live in a house that they own.  Florinda operates a platanos sales business.  She has a food stall in front of her house and meets her customers there.  Most of her customers are local people.  They say that she is friendly and considerate and that she is respected as a valued resident of the neighborhood.  Florinda has operated the business for 4 years.  Her children help her with the business, buying merchandise and tending to customers.  She says that the business is profitable and that she likes being her own boss and contributing to the family's expenses.  She worked taking care of other people's children before and says that she quit when she decided that she was too old enough to go on.  Now she wants to start a clothing sales business.  She plans to buy used clothing from markets in other towns and resell them locally.  This is Florinda's 8th MFP loan.  She says that she is grateful to lenders for supporting her business and helping her work to meet her goals.  She is committed, she says, to repaying the loan on time.  Florinda will use this 500 new soles loan to buy used clothing for her clothing sales business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1199484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy used clothing that she will resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T15:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.23,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":161.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447611},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":82.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053509},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":85.47,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188447},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":88.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":92.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572366},{"amount":36.42,"local_amount":91.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122029}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T18:48:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":476466,"name":"Thoeurn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"One of the breadwinners in a family consisting of five children, two of whom are students and the remaining three of whom are paid workers in Thailand, Theourn is 42-year-old farmer.

He wants to better provide for his family and says that they are the reason that he works hard.  The bar isn't his only business.  He also has a broom-making business and, if that and the bar weren't enough, a carwash that he operates next to the bar.  He sold used merchandise before and saved enough to start the first of his string of businesses.  He has grown bit by bit, always with the goal of making a better life for his family.  He likes being his own boss, he says, even though it's been difficult at times.  Competition from other similar businesses has led him to wonder if he could go on, but he always perservered, carried on by the love and support of his family.

Formerly she worked alone and these days she has two additional persons working alongside her as well as her husband. She's been working for two years and is happy because it is going well for her and so she is able to generate a considerable income for supporting her household with its basic expenses. She likes her work since in the mornings she is able to use part of her time for other primary activities in her home and handle other functions that are also necessary for the functioning of her business. \r\n\r\nFortunately she has customers every day since she is located in a highly accessible spot for the public. This allows her to increase her earnings daily and provide better living conditions for her family. She is still in the process of expanding and remodeling her establishment and hopes to finish within the medium term. This is her 13th loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing that she has financial support that guarantees her ability to continue working with much assurance.

She\u2019 single and the mother of two children she cares for with much dedication; she focuses all her efforts on them to get ahead and improve their daily living conditions.

She used to use it just to store what she used for her weekly meals but the need to earn income led her to use it for her economic activity and now it helps her earn income.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in business 10 years and fortunately does well since she earns good daily profits.  She works alone because she doesn\u2019t need help to do this work.  However, she also sells food and her mother does help her with this activity and her children help her take care of customers, wash utensils, and collect payment.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been selling outside her house for the last 8 years and always sells out everything she prepares daily for sale.  She\u2019s doing very well because having two activities generates double household income and this allows her to provide better living conditions for her family.  What she likes best about her work is chatting with the customers because this makes the long work day more pleasant.  Later on she plans to build a larger locale to provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThis is her second MFP loan and she\u2019s very excited and grateful for the economic backup she\u2019s being offered to continue with her plans.  She doesn\u2019t want to miss paying for it for lack of money which is why she commits to be very punctual and above all very responsible.  She\u2019s very happy to continue in this group because they are very responsible and kind.  She will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy ingredients to continue with her food business and will also buy soft-drinks and gelatin treats to continue selling at home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1199615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients, soft-drinks and gelatin snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-02T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-01T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.54,"local_amount":311.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":324.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447620},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":165.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053518},{"amount":68.42,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":178.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188456},{"amount":70.96,"local_amount":177.41,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":184.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572375},{"amount":72.66,"local_amount":181.65,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":189.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122038}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T02:59:01Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":475154,"name":"Nuri","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuri, de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer joven, alegre, din\u00e1mica y con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n, convive con Rildo y junto a \u00e9l tiene dos hijos de 7 y 4 a\u00f1os, vive a lado de ellos en su propia casa que lograron construir con muchos esfuerzo, ah\u00ed comparten sus d\u00edas llenos de amor y de grandes deseos de progreso.

She and her husband work in agriculture; her father taught her the occupation.  However, the more weighty work Yuly does is dressmaking, an occupation she learned from her mother at the age of 10.  At the age of 13 she attended an academy to hone her skills.  Today, she works alongside her husband manufacturing uniforms in addition to working in agriculture.  \r\n\r\nShe rises at 5am to prepare breakfast and get her daughter ready to go to school.  She then works all day in the tailor shop.

Her main attribute is that she works hard, overseeing her own brick production. She likes the work and says that she is a native of Lima so coming out to live in the country is a pleasure. Since then, she has spent 4 years working and coming to know this business. \r\n\r\nBeing a resourceful woman, she figured out a way to earn a higher profit by firing her bricks two times a month, unlike most producers. \"This way when the customers need bricks mid-month, they can buy mine as I have thousands of bricks ready at the time\" she says. She also tries to save money in her spare time by searching the countryside for enough logs and branches to fire her bricks so as not to have to buy them. Now she wants to keep improving the quality of her bricks. She belongs to the \"New Youth Generation\" solidarity group and this is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma [Kiva field partner]. She is thankful for the support she has gotten as it has helped her to grow her business's capital. That's why she promises to be punctual in making her payments. Rosa will invest the money in buying sand and sawdust for making bricks.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1200479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy sand and sawdust for making bricks.
