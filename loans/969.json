She has 10 year experience planting potatoes, corn and alfalfa. She has her own land she inherited from her father, but since it isn't enough she also rents more. She sells her crops in the country's capital where she makes good profits. She also raises animals, such as guinea pigs, sheep, pigs and cows. From the cows she gets milk. She remarks that soon she will have calves that will increase her cattle. Thanks to selling her animals she can cover certain expenses she has, such as paying for her only son's college tuition, for whom she is getting ahead. This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time. During these last few years the money has helped her dynamize her business and therefore her income.

Her loan will be used to buy more metals, old newspapers, empty bottles and jars to re-sell for profit.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Levita Gina would like to keep growing as a succesful entrepreneur and give the best education to her children. With the good funds she earns, she will also improve the family's poor living conditions.

He lives with his daughter Juliet in a house he's been renting for a year. He lived with his parents until a year ago, when he decided to become independent and live with his little girl. He works very hard so that he can improve his daughter's living conditions. His main business is focused on making bricks. \"I've learned the trade ever since I was a child; my parents and other relatives are in this line of work\", he says. That's why he became independent from his parents and started a business of his own three years ago. He currently has his own oven, which he uses to his full advantage, since it's his only source of income. He makes an average of 9,000 bricks a month, and he sells them at his own factory. The area where Victor works is very well-known for its brick manufacturing businesses, and they already have regular customers who come to negotiate the product.

She's separated from the father of her three children. Her children are the main reason for her to keep on working and therefore be able to improve their living conditions. They live together in a house that she owns and was able to purchase with hard work and a lot of sacrifice. Julia's business is selling food such as breakfast in the mornings and meals in the afternoons, etc. Every morning she opens her stall, which she rents in the central market, and there she offers all her prepared food and also refreshments. She tends to her customers very kindly. They're mostly her own seller neighbors, who recommend her to other people that eventually become her regular customers.\r\nShe got her start over 20 years ago with a private loan. She used to buy and sell in small quantities and then she gradually expanded the business according to the demand for her food. To this day she does the work on her own.\r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable because of the earnings she gets from it, and because she almost always sells everything she prepares.\r\nFurthermore, she reports that she enjoys her business, because she's skilled at cooking. She decided to start the business due to the need for an income and a trade of her own, because the child support wasn't enough for her children and she faced financial hardships. Now, as she sees good results, she wishes to keep her business going. This is her second loan with MFP. She's very glad to know that she has financial support, because that way she feels secure to move forward with her business. On her part, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely manner, as she has in her previous loans. Besides, she's very glad to be a member of her communal bank, since everyone is very responsible and supportive. With the requested amount of 1,500 nuevos soles she will purchase ingredients and supplies for making food and selling it at her stall. She'll get better prices for her purchases, and therefore she'll stay in business and increase her profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1200546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He has worked in agriculture since his childhood.  He learned this trade from his father, who was his example to continue, since by working very hard in agriculture he could sustain his family.  Because of this, Erasmo works very hard to get ahead with his family and with all of the household expenses.  He has been able to note that if he gives a lot of effort, in the end he has his reward.  With his work he has been able to make many projects in his house, and with his family, a reality. But, with the cost of living these days he feels that his income isn't the same now and because of this he wishes to acquire a loan to be able to cultivate more land and obtain a higher income upon selling his output.\r\n\r\nDon Erasmo buys the inputs he needs for his plants in the closest city, 3 kilometers from his house.  But, as there is no public transportation he has to pay for a carrier that moves it or, on the contrary, he has to move on his back from the store to his house and this produces extra wear.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested to buy fertilizers, poisons and insecticides to be able to apply them to his corn and bean plants on time, to have an excellent harvest.\r\n \r\nThe first necessity that will be satisfied is that he will be able to buy all of the inputs together and thus obtain a better price, have savings in the sale, and the application to the plants will be just in the time that they need them.\r\n\r\nHis life will improve greatly, since upon buying all of the inputs and applying them on time to his plants, the production will be very good and when it's time to sell them more income will be generated.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to be able to carry out his dream to have a prosperous and abundant harvest, having faith in God, and with the help of the loan to be able to buy the inputs that he needs to apply them to his plants.

She is very innovative and despite having no proper education she is very talented in creating art designs. Her husband works in a car repairing shop and earns insufficient funds to support his family alone. \r\n\r\nBecause her husband\u2019s income is too low to support the seven members of the family, so she started her own business. She does beautiful embroidery on bed sheets and towels and then sells them in the market. Her collection is very famous in her town. Her customer base is diverse and she serves her community well.

She works three days a week from two to three hours a day, and she sells on credit, requiring repayment every eight days. She has been carrying on this business for 4 years and it is going very well for her. The thing she sells most of is perfume. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics and clothes.

After three months, when the chickens are of adequate weight, she delivers them to a supplier who visits her at home to buy the chickens.  She has been doing this for more than 13 years and this is how she and her family get ahead.\r\n \r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy chickens, feed, and medicine.  She has been with the communal bank almost since the beginning and she likes it because one of the loans allowed her to start this business which allows her to make a living.\r\n \r\nShe hopes to be able to continue ahead and stay healthy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1200747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Junin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Didima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249.99,"local_amount":249.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":249.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383827},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990830},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127203},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517669},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069507},{"amount":83.37,"local_amount":83.37,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815615}],"funded_date":"2012-10-15T17:43:55Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T13:32:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She has a tabletop on which she places all kinds of sweet treats such as chocolate, cookies, candies, gum and other snacks.  She works near a very busy leisure center and fortunately she always makes good sales throughout the day.  Flora renews her products weekly and invests up to 300 soles in each purchase.  She has been in this business for more than 12 years and sometimes receives help from her grandchildren when they are not studying.  Sometimes Flora also sells food and drink at home, depending on the weather and the capital that she has available at the time.  What she likes about her business is that it allows her to make income herself which she can use to cover her grandchildren's needs.  She feels very happy to be working because it makes her feel useful to society though she has often felt like stopping because of the tiredness she experiences as a result of her age.  However, she always finds new energy and continues working with a lot of optimism.  She hopes to improve her sales business for the well-being of her family.  \r\n\r\nThis is Flora's 3rd loan from MFP.  She is grateful to the people who will give her the loan she needs to increase her working capital and pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  She is happy to belong to her community bank because the members are very supportive and responsible.

On the other hand, she comments that she likes the work in her communal bank that supports people with a line of credit to make their plans reality.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 900 new soles to buy furnishings like tables, chairs and others for her locale seeking the lowest prices for volume purchases so her profits will be higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1201307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs for her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":142.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":141.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":153.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":160.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.25,"local_amount":278.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":281.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447645},{"amount":54.96,"local_amount":141.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":142.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053543},{"amount":59.57,"local_amount":153.18,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":154.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188481},{"amount":62.54,"local_amount":160.84,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":162.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572400},{"amount":64.68,"local_amount":166.31,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":167.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122062}],"funded_date":"2012-10-06T21:11:38Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":477376,"name":"Frasht Al-Rabia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Frasht Al-Rabia and consists of three ladies and one man who live in Taiz, Yemen.\r\n\r\nJamila, 42 years old, lives in Taiz, Yemen.

He is a hard worker, dynamic and friendly.  She is living with Zen\u00f3n, who is the father of her five children ages 15, 13, 9, 7 and 4.  She lives with them in her own house, which she obtained years ago through effort and hard work.  \r\n\r\nLuc\u00eda makes a living selling groceries.  She has a small store set up in her home where she sells basic products that are known for their quality and low prices.  Among the items that she offers are rice, eggs, bread, milk, cooking oil and some sausages.  She started this business about eight years ago and it is doing well thanks to the good clientele that she has built over the years.  For the most part, she requires cash only, but she sometimes offers credit to those whom she trusts.  She sometimes gets help from her partner, who helps her with cutomers and with the transport of merchandise, which she brings in weekly.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her job is that she generates her own income, which allows her to pay for household necessities and helps her partner with the distribution and management of basic expenses.  What she doesn't like is that she has to attend to the business all day, which has caused her to give up family gatherings and outings.  However, she now always finds the necessary time to be with her family and has learned to balance her business with her home life.  \r\n\r\nThis is loan number 4 with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support that offers her the guarantee that she can continue working without worries.

Los tres viven en una casa de su propiedad que lograron construir gracias a muchos a\u00f1os de sacrificio y trabajo. La actividad que realiza Anita es la venta comidas regionales. Tiene un peque\u00f1o puesto ubicado en la vereda de su casa. Su trabajo empieza todas las ma\u00f1anas y culmina por la tarde. Prepara todo tipo de alimentos t\u00edpicos como \u201cjuane\u201d, \u201ctacacho\u201d y otros. Algunas veces vende de noche, principalmente en d\u00edas festivos o fines de semana. Por fortuna tiene buenas ventas y al alcanzar su horario habitual de trabajo siempre termina todo lo que ha preparado. Lleva en esta actividad m\u00e1s de 4 a\u00f1os y lo hace con el apoyo de su hija y de su pareja. Ocasionalmente trabaja brindando su mano de obra para viveros encargados del cultivo de plantas ornamentales o de producci\u00f3n alimenticia. Lo que le gusta de su actividad es que le permite tener un ingreso econ\u00f3mico con el cual apoya a su pareja en los gastos de su hogar, se siente c\u00f3moda y contenta porque desarrolla la actividad que le fascina,  lo que le desagrada es que en \u00e9pocas de lluvia no puede trabajar tranquila porque eso ausenta la llegada de clientes y por lo tanto disminuye sus ventas, pero no se desanima, espera m\u00e1s adelante establecer una tienda de abarrotes como otra fuente de ingresos econ\u00f3micos y continuar trabajando. Este es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 4 con MFP, est\u00e1 muy emocionada y agradecida por el respaldo econ\u00f3mico que le ofrecen para continuar con sus planes, no quiere dejar de pagarlo por falta de dinero y es por eso que se compromete a ser muy puntual y sobre todo muy responsable, est\u00e1 muy contenta de continuar con este grupo ya que son muy cumplidos y amables. Con el monto solicitado de 500 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 ingredientes e insumos como arroz, huevos, aceite, condimentos, aceitunas, pl\u00e1tano y otros para continuar preparando sus platillos.\n\n","en":"Anita, 51, is a hardworking, enterprising woman who has lived with Abel for many, long years.  They have a 19-year-old daughter who is the main reason for her striving daily to provide her with the best.  The three of them live in a house they built thanks to many years of sacrifice and hard work.\r\n\r\nAnita\u2019s activity is selling regional dishes.  She has a small stand located in her street.  She starts work in the morning and ends in the evening.  She prepares all types of traditional dishes like \u201cjuanes\u201d and \u201ctacacho,\u201d among others.  Sometimes she sells at night especially on feast days and weekends.  Fortunately, her sales are good and by the end of her usual work schedule she\u2019s sold out of everything she\u2019s prepared.  She\u2019s been in business four years and her spouse and daughter help her with it.  \r\n\r\nOccasionally she works providing labor for ornamental plant or food nurseries.  What she likes about her activity is that it allows her to earn income to help her spouse with household expenses and she feels comfortable and happy because she can do work that she enjoys.  What she doesn\u2019t like is the rainy season because she can\u2019t work with peace of mind because customers are fewer so sales drop.  But she does not become discouraged.  She hopes later on to open a grocery store as an additional source of income and to continue working.\r\n\r\nThis is her 4th MFP loan.  She\u2019s very excited and grateful for the economic support she\u2019s being offered to continue with her plans.  She does not want to fail to repay it for lack of money which is why she commits to be very punctual and above all very responsible.  She\u2019s very happy to continue with this group because they are very responsible and kind. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1201322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, eggs, oil, condiments, olives and bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-03T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-02T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.41,"local_amount":76.03,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":78.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447647},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":79.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053545},{"amount":33.01,"local_amount":82.52,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188483},{"amount":33.24,"local_amount":83.1,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572402},{"amount":34.8,"local_amount":86.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":90.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122064},{"amount":36.72,"local_amount":91.81,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":95.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867889}],"funded_date":"2012-10-04T06:13:20Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":476221,"name":"Elkin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias a que un amigo suyo estaba vendiendo el negocio, Elkin aprovech\u00f3 la oportunidad y hacerse con el almac\u00e9n que se estaba vendiendo a muy bajo precio.

She and her children have figured out ways to get ahead together since Mar\u00eda is a widow and has no other economic support.  With this fourth loan she will buy a food display case and products like rice, oil, meat, vegetables, chicken and fruit to make refreshments.

He learned farming from a neighbor who taught him how to cultivate, and then gave him work for approximately one year. Some time ago, in an effort to increase his income, Gilberto decided to start growing his own crops. His main challenge is that he is separated from the mother of his two children, who depend on him financially, and this makes his household financial situation difficult. Nevertheless, with his crops, he hopes to be able to improve this situation, which is why Gilberto is now requesting this loan in order to install an irrigation system for his crops. This system will increase his crops, which will in turn allow him to sell more produce. <p>\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to have the financial resources needed to provide his children, ages 1 and 5,

Lleva en esta actividad mas de 10 a\u00f1os y por fortuna desde que empez\u00f3 le ha ido muy bien aunque reconoce que tuvo que pasar algunos meses para que se acostumbre a la rutina laboral. Trabaja con la ayuda de su esposo y de algunos obreros que contrata dependiendo de la magnitud del trabajo a realizar. Lo que le agrada de su trabajo es la rentabilidad que obtiene por sus ventas, ya que este producto es muy cotizado y solicitado por la poblaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s al complementarlo con otros productos sus ganancias econ\u00f3micas son siempre favorecidas. Planea obtener un puesto de ventas en alg\u00fan mercado de la ciudad en donde pueda vender por unidades para ganar a\u00fan m\u00e1s. Este es el cr\u00e9dito numero 12 con MFP, por ello se siente agradecida con las personas que le brindan el financiamiento que necesita para que pueda concretar sus planes, por otro lado se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de manera puntual y espera continuar trabajando con su banco comunal por el compa\u00f1erismo y la solidaridad que muestran entre ellos cada uno de sus integrantes. Con el pr\u00e9stamo de 800 nuevos soles, contratar\u00e1 el personal necesario para la siembra de ma\u00edz que en esta temporada tiene un buen precio de venta. \n\n","en":"Vilma, age 43, is a cheerful and hardworking female entrepreneur. She is married to Pedro, who is the father of her 5 children ages 25, 23, 21, 9, and 2. They all live in a house that they own, which they built a long time ago, and they all give it their best to get ahead in life. Our friend Vilma sells papayas for a living. She has a small farm in which she cultivates mainly papaya, as well as other crops like plantains, corn, and other short-term produce. She generally harvests her crops on a weekly basis, and once she obtains the amount of produce she needs, she transports it to the river port where she sells it by the hundreds at wholesale prices. She's been in business for over 10 years, and luckily, she has been prosperous, though she admits that she had to let several months go by before she got used to this work routine. She works with the help of her husband and laborers that she hires depending on how big her task is. What she likes about her business is how lucrative it is as this crop is very sought-after by the locals. Furthermore, by offering other crops, her profits are always favorable. She is planning to obtain a stand in a city market where she can sell her produce at retail prices and earn even more money. This is her 12th loan with MFP, which is why she is very grateful to the lenders because she needs this money to realize her plans. She also commits to repaying her loans punctually, and she hopes to continue working with her microfinance bank because of the camaraderie and solidarity that each of its members display. With this 800.00 PEN loan, she will hire the laborers she needs to plant corn, a crop that is quite lucrative during this season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1201468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire farm laborers for help in planting corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-04T00:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-03T00:00:24Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":127.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":139.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":146.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.47,"local_amount":121.76,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":128.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447656},{"amount":51.75,"local_amount":127.39,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":134.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053554},{"amount":53.68,"local_amount":132.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":139.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188492},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":133.08,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":140.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572411},{"amount":56.6,"local_amount":139.31,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":146.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122073},{"amount":59.44,"local_amount":146.32,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":154.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867898}],"funded_date":"2012-10-04T04:35:07Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":476315,"name":"Kaypacha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cKAYPACHA\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is able to earn around 10,000KHR per day and manages to save about 3,000KHR each day after deducting daily expenses.

She is leading her group to request a loan. Sarou will use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes this loan will help her to grow her rice healthfully and fruitfully so as to fulfill her dream to buy a tractor in order to help her rice-field

She used to be only dedicated to her household duties, but then started baking bread with chicken two years ago. Later, she started working as a photographer and taking videos. Today she is starting a business raising and selling chickens, since Christmastime is coming and that is when there is the most demand. Last year she gave it a try with 60 chickens and made a good profit, and she ran the business from her own home while caring for her two children, a 13-year-old boy and a 8-year-old girl. She travels to the city to buy the chickens and the feed in her husband's car, and it takes about 45 minutes. She is requesting the loan to purchase five pallets of wood, 15 zinc sheets, a roll of fabric, cinder blocks, black plastic sheeting, 300 chickens, five bags of feed, and feeding and drinking bins, and to pay for electrical installation. With this investment, Marleni will be able to upgrade her chicken coop and increase the number of chickens it holds. After taking her profits she will be able to repair her husband's car, which is in poor condition. It will also help her provide her family with everything it needs to improve its quality of life. Her biggest wish is for her children to have the opportunity to get an education, because she came from a family with limited resources and could not afford to go to school, and she wants her children to have what she couldn't."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1203104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wood, zinc sheets, fabric, cinder blocks, black plastic sheeting, 300 chicks, five sacks of feed, and feeding and drinking bins, and to pay for electrical installation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-10-04T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-03T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":334.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":375.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":419.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":470.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":419.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":369.64,"local_amount":369.64,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":369.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495325},{"amount":1230.36,"local_amount":1230.36,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1230.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090559}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T21:09:33Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:16:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":477664,"name":"Florenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florenda is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fishing business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing 13,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) through NWTF to buy an additional pump boat for her fishing business.\r\n\r\nFlorenda has been in this business for three years.

To tackle the financial difficulty, Nimol and her husband have done rice-cropping on six hectares of farmland for several years as the main source of their famiily's income. To increase their income, this couple also runs a small grocery store at home. Both businesses have provided her about 20,000 KHR per day. She has saved about 14,000 KHR each day after daily expenses. However, a lack of water supply is still the main challenge for her paddy business.\r\n\r\nNimol\u2019s group consists of five members who live in the same village. She and two of her fellow group members are in their second-cycle microloan, while the remaining two members are first-time borrowers with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. Nimol feels empowered that she can relieve her family's burden and improve their livelihood after the past loans were paid back with success. Now she is leading her group to seek a loan. Nimol, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland and split a portion of it to buy more grocery items for reselling. She hopes her crop yield will become more productive and profitable so as to make a better living for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1203552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-04T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-03T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pov","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1522462.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118926},{"amount":495,"local_amount":1980000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2009650.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331266025},{"amount":5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20299.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641367},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1217969.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197446}],"funded_date":"2012-10-06T17:10:02Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debbie Freeman","image":524609}},{"id":477668,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia is married and has three children.
