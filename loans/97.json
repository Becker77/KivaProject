She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sesilia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sesilia needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sesilia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sesilia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sesilia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:  Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

production in Lom\u00e9.  This activity has taken an important place due to the high demand which exists in the area and especially during the dry seasons where the warmth is excessive and where members of the population are consuming to refresh themselves. Born on January 17th, 1967 and mother of three (3) children, Madam Antoinette is an accountant by trade. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the luck of a stable job. Therefore, she decided to launch in this trade which provides an income that allows her to cover her needs.\r\n\r\nConsidering the importance that constitutes this activity characterised by increasingly higher demand, Madam Antoinette forecasts to expand her project by selling other products like frozen fish. The proximity of her trade near the market of N\u2019kafu proves a great advantage.\r\n\r\nThe credit of $650 that she is soliciting today will serve to buy one freezer, two coolers, supplies of fresh fish and chicken, and fruit juice fabrication products.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame Antoinette F. tient depuis deux ans \u00e0 Lom\u00e9 un petit commerce de production et de commercialisation de la glace, d\u2019eau fra\u00eeche et de jus de fuit.

He worked for a long as an assistant carpenter in a carpentry shop, but went through jobless times, and so he began to look for work in other places.  During some of the time spent without work, he began to think about the possibility of undertaking his own carpentry business, since he was very good at making furniture.  And so it was with very little tools and all his savings that he decided to buy wood to make his first furniture.  And this is how his business began 14 years ago, one client at a time. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Angel's struggle still continues, and this is why he's thinking of making furniture to sell to his clients on credit (this way he'd be able to get more of his furniture out there).  He is now applying for a loan of $925 USD, which he's willing to pay within 6 months.  This loan will make it possible for Angel to purchase raw materials to make furniture to sell on credit.<p>\r\n\r\nWith your help Angel can move forward with his family and enable his business to grow.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel Mario es un hombre que a luchado por sacar s sus tres hijos adelante.

Mrs. N. has been in TYM since 1995.  All her previous loans had been used to invest in lifestock breeding and dish-washing service (at weddings and funerals).  Since 2000, she has moved into a new business, taking wedding pictures, help the bride with make-up and renting wedding dresses.  Her income had increased substantially to 300 dollars per month.  In addition, Mr. Thiep, her husband has also been working as security guard at the People's Committee.  With a more stable flow of income, they have been able to send their two sons to school throughout the years.  Both had done very well and are currently at universities in Hanoi, one at Medical School and the other at The College of Economics.  She is very grateful for the help from TYM and would like to continue to be part of the group.  This loan cycle, she would like to ask for 1200 USD to buy the photograph's screener and new wedding dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

That\u2019s where she does business, which she started in 1983 when she was still a student.  She used to sell during all the main vacation periods in July and August.  Her $60 in initial capital had enabled her to buy a sack of cassava flour.  \r\n<p>\r\nOver the years, she acquired solid experience in selling cassava flour until she was married in1989.  She continued her commerce in her home, bringing $240 in capital in 1993.  Her business was destroyed by pillaging that took place the same year.  After a period of inactivity, she started up her business again from 2002 through the present with $60 in capital and in the food sector, still.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn August 2008, Liliane decided to join one of the groups of the micro-finance institution HOPE with the goal of diversifying her business and growing her revenues.  She is a loyal customer of HOPE who has already had two loans that she repaid regularly and completely.  The loan she obtained this April was used to buy two sacks of cassava flour.  She also diversified her business by including smoked and salted fish for resale, so as to augment her profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nLiliane is 41 years old, married, and the mother of five children, ages 5 to 19; the eldest is on his own, and four go to school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is from the village of Kabulawan in Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental. Lorna is married. To make a living, Lorna owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) store where she sells a variety of foods and daily-use products, such as shampoo, in the local community. Lorna has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP that she will use to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be Lorna's 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Anasii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Anasii S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Redford is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Redford from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

In the future, he also wants to build a house in the capital for his children, so they can have somewhere to stay when they go to university.  He thanks God for giving him the vitality and strength to work, a doctrine on which he has always relied in raising his family.

Pon Sokthy, her husband, is a motor taxi driver earning US$3.50 per day. Being a motor taxi driver in Cambodia is only a step above unemployment in most cases.

All of the kids are fully enrolled in school, another impressive achievement for your average poor Khmer family.

He is married with three children. Savridin is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock. He sells his livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Savridin is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase an additional young cow. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $900 USD in his business. In order to receive this amount, Savridin has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She got married at the very early age of 16 and never finished high school. Now she has seven children to take care of. She has promised herself that she would work hard and teach good values to her children so that they will not suffer the same fate as she. \r\n\r\nGina is a very dynamic mother who has always dreamed of a bright future for her children. She joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines, in 2006. She started selling fish in their community but now after several years her business has improved. She is applying for a loan of Php 20,000 to finance her now enlarged fish trading business. She will buy more fish and supply directly to fish vendors in the market. \r\n\r\nShe has already identified buyers and she is planning to market her fish in other towns and provinces. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will support her business plans so that she can generate more profit and be able to pay for her children\u2019s schooling. Her ultimate dream is to send her children up through college and see them earn a degree. \r\n\r\nNote: Please ignore the date on the picture; the setting on the camera is not properly adjusted.

Zarif is 58 years old. He is married with 3 children of school age. Zarif has been in the business of selling cows for almost 30 years. He buys them from villagers and from the nearby province, then fattens them for reselling to abattoirs and farmers. His wife has been a fruit seller for two years. Zarif is requesting a loan of 10,000 Somoni to purchase additional cows to raise for resale. This loan will allow him to better provide for his family.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maria took charge of bringing the women together for meetings to appoint members of the group.  One of the characteristics of this group is its on-time installment payments and its savings.  The committee\u2019s current goal is to meet with other women in the neighborhood to clean the sidewalks and streets, as well as plant trees on the block, all with their children\u2019s care and wellbeing in mind.<p>\r\nMaria is very happy and proud to be an integral part of a group of women with honest goals such as helping to improve the quality of life in their community by doing community work.  For example, they have organized athletic activities, musical contests and a San Juan party, with the objective of raising funds to increase their savings.  In so doing, the group has planned for any unexpected event that might occur and thus provided the greatest assurance that late payments will not occur.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

This is Aziza S. from Mbozi. She is 31, married and has one 6 year old child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphan.\r\nAziza has been selling used clothing and drinks since 2007. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers such as Aziza, who re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\nShe works 13 - 16 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by one employee and by her husband. Aziza currently earns about 210USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more clothes and drinks in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Aziza thanks you for your support!\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":368607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes and drinks in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T03:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziza R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105856},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022966},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868207},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757403},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146497},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984642}],"funded_date":"2009-08-14T02:13:18Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheila McCormick","image":null}},{"id":132646,"name":"Koko\u00e8","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame est une revendeuse de produits d\u2019alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

The Mathora Secondary school is situated in Magburaka and is one of the oldest secondary schools in northern Sierra Leone. It is a boarding school and currently enrolls 930 pupils. Since its inception in 1959, several of the country\u2019s female dignitaries have passed through this school \u2013 ministers, lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers and so on. Today, as a result of the new educational system being introduced by the Ministry of Education called the 6334 (i.e. six years in primary school, three years in Junior secondary school, three years in Senior secondary school and four years in university), the school is being divided into a senior and junior secondary schools with two principals running each one of the schools.\n\nIn 1998, the rebel invasion of the town of Magburaka left the school in ruins \u2013 buildings, staff quarters and dormitories were damaged. Laboratory equipment was destroyed, especially in the home economics and biology departments. Because of the invasion, the students and staff were forced to flee to Freetown to the Richard Allen High School, where they sought refuge until 2003.  After a peace treaty between the rebels and the government was reached in 2002, they were able to return to Magburaka.\n\nWith funds from the United Nations and the European Union, the once-mutilated school has been rehabilitated. UNICEF refurnished the laboratories with new equipment. The school is up-and-running once again, but the scar left by the rebels still remains \u2013 many of the teachers are not willing to return to the remote village of Mathora and a host of them have decided to remain in Freetown, where living conditions are bit better to that of the Mathora village. There are only a few who are willing to return and are determined to help the pupils of Magburaka and its environs.\n\nAdditionally, the teaching profession is one of the least preferred professions in Sierra Leone because salaries are not very attractive. Those who have found themselves in the profession usually are forced to seek other ways of earning more income to supplement their salaries. Many of them either engage in petty trading, in agriculture or in organizing extra classes (a practice the Sierra Leone government is trying to stop) in an effort to make additional money. \n\nSome of the teachers from Mathora have requested the loan for purposes of expanding their businesses.  Others will use their loans to give to their wives, who may already be businesswomen. It is out of their wives\u2019 businesses that they generate additional income and assist a great deal in the running of their respective households. Furthermore, some of the teachers will be using the loan for either a building project or in buying pieces of furniture \u2013 a piece of furniture which they would not normally be able to buy on their current salary. Finally, some will use their loan either to pay school fees and other related charges for their children or pursue further studies themselves.\n\nJohn M. B. (on the left) is a senior teacher at the school and head of this group. He has been a teacher for eighteen years. John was born in a place call Rotufunk, in southern Sierra Leone. He is forty-eight years old, married to a businesswoman and they have three children. One of their child is attending secondary school and the others are in primary schools. This is the third loan John and others in the group have received from SMT\/Kiva Lenders.

Several years ago she went through some difficult times.  She needed surgery caused by an infection and, once recovered, had to continue working to be able to support her little children.  She began preparing breakfasts at home which she would then go out to peddle.  This only produced enough profits to partially cover her household expenses.  So, with the funding she plans to enlarge her business preparing not just breakfasts but other meals as well to try to earn additional income.  Mar\u00eda Elena is the group leader.  Vilma is another active member who has sold catalogue beauty products for the past 2 years.  In that time, she was able to make enough profits to be able to pay cash for her products and have ample stock available for her customers.  Now she is able to help her husband with household expenses.  Like Mar\u00eda Elena, Gladys peddles breakfasts.  Sometimes she doesn't have many buyers but she is optimistic and knows that she has a lot of competition so, she rises very early thinking of her son's future, and makes her best effort each day.

The thirteen members are very hard-working women who try to progress through their businesses.  Many of them are the source of economic support for their home.  We met Anita and Gladis, who told us about their experiences as microbusinesswomen.  Anita is 38 and is a single mother.  She started to work five years ago making decorations for the home out of materials like ribbon, satin ribbon, and macram\u00e9.  She also makes wallets and sandals.  She bought these materials on credit at the beginning because she didn't have enough capital to invest in them.  She sold her products to her siblings, aunts and uncles, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.  She used the loans she received later to buy glue, different colored thread, ribbons, yarn, ties for bags, silicone, soles for sandals, accessories to make wallets, bathroom decorations, flowerpots, corner protectors for furniture, and little angels and Santas for Christmas.  She took a silverwork class a year and a half ago with the goal of designing earrings, rings, bracelets, and necklaces to increase her income.  Later on she bought a digital scale that she needed for her business.  She needs this loan to invest in natural stones, silver thread by the gram, pliers, and accessories to make her pieces out of silver.<p>\r\nGladis is 57.  When she was 25, she bought some fabric remnants to make baby clothes.  She used her creativity to make lovely designs with the only goal of supporting her husband with the costs of raising their children.  The desire to learn to make other items led her to study courses in crafts, chocolate, and other subjects.  This is how she learned to make chocolates, stuffed animals, and canvas shoes that she sold to her friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and family members.  She had the goal of supporting her home and educating her grandson that she has been caring for since he was young.  She will use this loan to buy dulce de leche, dried fruit, chocolate, wrappers, and molds to make chocolates.  She will also buy beauty products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":459795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for their businesses making home decorations and chocolates","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crisalida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Xenia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Dariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jhaqueline Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":619.1,"local_amount":1776,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064617},{"amount":618.4,"local_amount":1774,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1781,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899676},{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":1775,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1782,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933759},{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":1775,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1782,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661353}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T02:08:25Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":169778,"name":"Georgia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEL grupo Georgia est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres trabajadoras una de ellas Miriam del Carmen M.

Their youngest, Victoria, 17, is in 3rd year of secondary school and he supports her.\r\n\r\nRamiro is asking AFODENIC for his 5th loan which he will use to build a bedroom in his house in order to be more comfortable and have more privacy since they are a large family and they lack sufficient space for all of them to live because Elieth's children from a former marriage live in the house, too.\r\n\r\nRamiro's greatest wish is to provide his wife with basic home conditions according to his means.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

They all live in Nianfor, a village 90 KM from the capital region of Ziguinchor.

It was created in October of 2002, during the inauguration of the Village Bank project.  Most of the members of the group have very good credit, having profited 17 times and never having difficulty in repayment.\r\n\r\nThe current loan has allowed them to stock-up on agricultural fertilizers and a sufficient quantity of palm oil and ingredients for making of ice-cream and fresh fruit juices.\r\n\r\nAs for the president of the group, Mrs. Fatoumata M., number 03KD3211081072, is 43 years old.

Her goal is to increase her business by purchasing another refrigerator to make more product in order to earn more profits and be able to improve her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nOn top of reimbursing their loan regularly, the women earn a monthly savings of about 25% of their funds.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McMahon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":536268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing the level of investment in the group","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Ziguinchor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-05-08T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariama Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jozianne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Borry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":615000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":615000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1225,"local_amount":615000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":620166.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380082}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T10:13:15Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn McMahon","image":null}},{"id":203123,"name":"Espiritu Santo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comiteEspiritu Santo se formo mediante la invitaci\u00f3n de la asesora y el deseo de las se\u00f1oras de formar un grupo solidari para trabajar y progresar a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida  de sus familias. \nUna de la integrantes es la se\u00f1ora Juana quien se dedica a la venta de Joyas, ellaa sae unicio con esta actividad despues de formar parte del comit\u00e9, y su forma der trabajo consiste en ofreser sus prendas a  conocido y amigos vendio en ocasiones a cr\u00e9dito o al contado. \nLa se\u00f1ora Juana solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mas joyas como pulcera, aros, gargantillas, cadenas y otros todosn oro y plata para contar con mayor variedad de productos para ofrecer a sus clientes.\n\n","en":"The formation of the \u201cEspirtu Santo\u201d (Holy Spirit) Committee resulted from an invitation offered by an advisor.

The members decided to give the group this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they all live. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Silvia C. V. since she is the group's president.  Silvia is 37 years old, married, and has four children: Arturo, Areli, KarL. and Alejandro.  All four are in school.  The first two are in the sixth and fifth year of elementary school, the third is in the third year of pre-school and the youngest is barely a year old.  Silvia owns a fruit store.\r\n\r\nSilvia decided to start out in this business because a family member told her that it was a very good source of income.  She also knew that it would help her to support her husband with their household expenses and their children's education expenses and would improve their family's quality of life.  Silvia invested her loan in buying merchandise such as: apples, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, chili peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce and other fruit and veg.\r\n\r\nSilvia is very happy because she says that her business is doing very well.  Both her sales and her number of customers have increased quite a bit.  This means that her profits have also risen satisfactorily, so much so, in fact, that she has even been able to buy an iron.\r\n\r\nSilvia's goal is to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they can finish complete their higher education and have a better future.  She would also like to grow her small business some more since she would like to expand the premises where she has her fruit store a little.  This will mean that she can better stock her store and thereby sell a wider range of produce and improve her profits.\r\n\r\nSilvia tells us that her group works very well since all the members have known each other for some time and they are very responsible in making their repayments since they don't want to let people down after they have placed their trust in them and supported them.\r\n\r\nSilvia is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva lenders for the unconditional support that they are providing since it has meant that her quality of life and that of her family has improved and she has been able to continue investing in her business.\r\n\r\nThe names and business activities of the rest of the Huamuchapa group members follow below:\r\n\r\nCelia C.

The group is based in Los Alcarrizos, a dusty industrial town north of Santo Domingo, where Santa makes her home in a simple structure with her husband and one child.\r\n\r\nSanta has come to Esperanza with the goal of growing her business, which supplies hair products to salons in her neighborhood. She intends to use this loan to purchase hair products such as shampoos, rinses, conditioners, deep treatments, straightening, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan (her 5th), Santa believes she will be able to keep providing supplies to more salons and to distinguish herself by always having needed, high quality products in stock. She will use the profits to expand her sales to other communities by buying in larger quantities. In the long term, Santa would like to continue growing her business with Esperanza to the point where she can sell more products, reach more clients and eventually save to have enough profits to purchase her own home.

There is little competition because most entrepreneurs at the market sell clothing. \r\nSaid offers good quality products at fair prices and has gained a good reputation among his clients. He would like to widen the assortment of his inventory.  Said needs $2000 USD.  He finds this loan very helpful for his business development.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Burulsun, having worked as a German language teacher for a long time, was able to provide all of her children with education.  Two of her daughters became teachers, the middle daughter is a doctor, one son works as a furniture carpenter, and the youngest became the pillar and Burulsun's main helper in running the agricultural business.  Burulsun started her animal husbandry business in 1991 with the sum of 10,000 som (KGS) and, thanks to persistent work, increased the quantity of livestock to the value of 100,000 som (KGS).  Burulsun went to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to request a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep in order to further develop her business.  She plans to invest the income from the loan into the repairs of sheep yards and future increase of quantity of livestock.  In the future, Burulsun wants to buy a car for her

He is 30 years old and lives with his wife, Shushanik, his 14-year-old son, his 13-year-old daughter, and his parents. Shushanik is a housewife. Valerik is leading the agricultural business of the family. He has ten pigs and cows. He sells piglets locally, as well as dairy products. Valerik and his father also work as tinsmiths, making tin ovens which are widely used in nearby villages in greenhouses during the fall and winter months.

Little by little, Shavkatjon has been able to expand his inventory and, thanks to the good service he offers, his business is now growing rapidly.

Nazokat is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. Nazokat is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of 4700 Somoni to increase the inventory she has for sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her story, however, is touching and the harshness of her expression only masks her great heart.  She tells us that she didn\u2019t used to work because her husband wouldn\u2019t permit her to.  She has two adult children, a 35- and a 25-year-old.  Unfortunately, one of them left the country to look for work and this saddened her very much to the point of becoming ill and depressed.  A friend of hers motivated her to sell beauty products and this is how she started her business.  At the beginning, it was just to have something to do that would keep her mind occupied.  However, two years ago she started to really become dedicated to it when she saw how profitable it could be but, above all, being busy helped her to partly overcome her son\u2019s absence.\r\n\r\nA neighbor in town told her about EDAPROSPO and motivated her to join the \u201cUNIDAS TRIUNFAREMOS\u201d (Together We Will Succeed) group.  All the members are from the neighborhood and Antonieta is the group president.  Her strong character makes it possible for her to lead the group.  On the other hand, she does well with her business and she has many customers.\r\n\r\nDespite her husband\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for her work, she continues ahead and doesn\u2019t become discouraged; she has projects to meet, like having her own store in which to display her beauty products.  \r\n\r\nWith the funds from this loan she will buy beauty products merchandise because she has several pending orders to fill.\r\n\r\nAntonieta still has dreams to fulfill and knows that she must keep busy, not only to overcome her son\u2019s absence, but to earn a livelihood and show that age need not be a barrier to continue working.\r\n\r\n*Antonieta is seated in front wearing the flowered blouse.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":510321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T05:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodas De Casta\u00f1eda Irma Dorila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elizabet Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonieta Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Milena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hilda Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Zohila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661453},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694113},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877077},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617050}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T04:29:36Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":190848,"name":"Esperanca Jose","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Esperan\u00e7a Jos\u00e9 N. nasceu no Distrito de Chibuto, Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, Sul de Mo\u00e7ambique tem 47 anos de idade, separada e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos de 29 e 21 anos de idade, j\u00e1 n\u00e3o estudam.

Jamshed is 20 years old and is not married. Due to his family\u2019s financial situation, he did not have many opportunities to study at the university. That\u2019s why, after finishing school, he tried to become independent and to find a way of earning in order to help his parents with the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, Jamshed has supported his family through his efforts. Through the years, he tried various types of activities and finally, four years ago, he started his business selling cellphones. He believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows him to support his family.\r\n\r\nCurrently, his business is doing well, but Jamshed needs to increase his stock of goods in order to serve the demands of his clientele. With this purpose in mind, Jamshed requests 10,000 Somoni. He is grateful to all those supporting him and promises to repay the loan promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store.  Her husband Anthony, who is 33 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 2 to 9 years old. Amelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements.  Amelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They are all local entrepreneurs in Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone.  Each one of the group received a loan of Le 500,000 during the last loan cycle. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use their profits to pay their children\u2019s school fees.  They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 700,000 each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nFinda (second from left) is the leader of the group. She is forty-five years of age. She was born in Kabala, Kionadugu district in northern Sierra Leone. She is married and has three children. Two of her children are already married and one is in secondary school. She has been a businesswoman since childhood days.<P>\r\n \r\nFinda sells cottons, gara lappers (locally dyed cloth with fabricated designs) and firewood. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She travels to Freetown (about 390 miles r\/t) to buy the pieces of cotton used for the gara. As for the firewood, she buys it from neighboring villages. The fare to Freetown is Le 12,000 and she usually pays a delivery fee of Le 5,000 for the cottons. In Freetown, a piece of cotton costs something between Le 75,000 to Le 80,000. A truck of firewood costs Le 300,000.<P>\r\n\r\nSo far, Finda faces no serious challenge in her business that is worth noting. Business is going fine. She enjoys what she does for a living. To Finda and her colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better. They will be able to take good care of their children, specifically their educational and nutritional needs, and save some money for emergencies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":254659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Expand her business by buying cottons and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Finda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bamba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142.5,"local_amount":420000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":425362.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885083},{"amount":95,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":283575.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128925},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":354468.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025714},{"amount":356.25,"local_amount":1050000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1063406.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008517},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":708937.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102860}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T20:13:13Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":87589,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort N. sells fish which she buys from the fishermen, brings them home for processing and preservation, and then sends them to the market for sale at Nyankumasi near Cape Coast.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is requesting the loan to purchase ingredients such as corn, lime, firewood and sweetcorn because currently those products are expensive and she wants to stick with the business since it's her source of income. Vidalia started the business when she saw those kinds of products were in high demand, and since then she has dedicated herself daily to this work with the help of her daughters. She has had the business for 12 years and works every day from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. She hopes that with the loan she can increase her sales and expand her business to include selling tortillas as she does with the corn and tamales. Vidalia is married and has two school-age children who help her with the business daily.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mereane joined Kiva partner SPBD and this is her first loan with them.   SPBD's loans are Mereane's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii andTonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

This is where he spends most of his day since he has to care for his crops in order to protect them from the insects that threaten to destroy them.  \r\n\r\nViviano's goal for this year is to raise enough capital to be able to buy his own land in Llanco so that he can be closer to his family.  This is his seventh loan with MFP and he is very happy to belong to his communal bank.  With the two thousand soles (Peruvian currency) that he is requesting, he will buy remedies to combat the insects and also fertilizer so that he will have a better harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":610614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bags of fertilizer and remedies to combat insects","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-06T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2027.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269358}],"funded_date":"2010-10-07T14:23:04Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":240034,"name":"Geoconda Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Geoconda Elizabeth C.
