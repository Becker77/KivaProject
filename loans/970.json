One of her children is dependent on her and helps the family\u2019s business. Chhoen has farmed rice on 1.5 hectares of farmland for 20 years to make a living. She is able to earn about KHR 30,000 per day and save about KHR 10,000 each day for her future needs. Insufficient water supply and fertilizer for supporting her paddy field are still the main challenges for her business.\r\n\r\nChhoen\u2019s group consists of two members who have been with VisionFund for one cycle. Chhoen fully repaid the past loan, which helped her relieve her family\u2019s burden and improve their livelihood. Now, she and her group member are requesting a loan of KHR 600,000 and KHR 1,000,000, respectively. As the leader, Chhoen will use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland and to pay for labor fees in plowing the field. She hopes this loan will help her grow healthy and fruitful rice so as to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1203602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-04T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-03T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chhoen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreyngob","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":811981.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197448},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":304493.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046701},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":507488.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942194}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T05:35:28Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debbie Freeman","image":524609}},{"id":480730,"name":"Rahamatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeune dame de 28ans, Rahamatou est c\u00e9libataire et n\u2019a pas d\u2019enfants en charge.

She is married. \r\n\r\nShe was born in rural areas, so she has experience in raising animals and crop cultivation. Living conditions for them were very heavy. She herded cattle at a very early age. After school, she worked in the fields to earn money. After her marriage, she again worked in the fields. Her husband left for Russia and worked there for two years. \r\n\r\nIn general, Muhayo grows wheat, corn, peas, and other agricultural products. For more than five months, she has been in this business on her own. Her husband helps her in doing the business.

As the main source of income for her family, Saltanat is engaged in raising crops and livestock, having started this business after the collapse of the Soviet Union that caused unemployment and the dissolution of collective farms. Starting with five sheep, Saltanat through hard work today has in her farm six dairy cows with offspring and ten sheep.

At the age of 20 he married Guadalupe and together they worked in the other people's farms as laborers until little by little they were acquiring their own land on which they produce coffee along side their children. The production of the family is all organic coffee for some years now, as they do not use chemical products to fertilize or clean their farm. To maintain a high quality coffee Santiago needs to prepare his land for harvest as some have completed their cycle of productive life and must be restarted. He also needs to do cleaning tasks and for that he is requesting a loan which will pay for the end of the harvest. In addition to coffee, Santiago and his family also produce sugar cane since the area where they live is ideal also for this crop.

She came to Arvand for support and wants to prepare for the winter in advance by stocking up on coal because she has to use heating in the winter.  Her business is sewing women's national dresses to-order.  Everything that she earns goes toward the family needs, and nothing is left for major expenses.  Mohiniso's husband has been working in the Russian Federation for the third year now.  She has been obtaining financing since 2011.  This is her second loan.  Mohiniso wants to use this loan to purchase coal for the winter while the coal prices are reasonable.  This is the only way to heat her house in the winter.

She works as an elementary school teacher at the local school and is known as the main organizer for competitions and various entertainment events at the school.  Also, to provide an additional source of income for her family, Nadira is involved in farming, having started this business in 1995 with a sum of 5,000 som.

From left to right, Rehema is the second person standing in a red blouse and black dress.\r\n\r\nFortune Womens group is located on the outskirts of Ibanda town. The group is comprised of only women whose major activity is agriculture. They fall into different categories including divorcees, widows, single mothers and married women.\r\n \r\nRehema is a single mother of six children. She lost her husband three years ago. Among her six children, four are in school. She also takes care of her son\u2019s two children because their parents failed to raise their school fees.\r\n\r\nRehema is mainly an agriculturalist who grows crops and raises pigs and goats. She supplements the farming with income from a small retail shop with capital of UGX 100,000.

Mar\u00eda and her partner are always taking care of their plants, because their crop always pays good earnings. However, sometimes it's difficult for her to carry the harvest sacks, to the point that they get transportation to take her beans to the supply centers. Even so they continue on with their labors. \r\n\r\nThat's why, since they worked with loans, they have achieved a good coffee production for the improvement of their quality of life.

The low price of her crop yield is still her main business challenge.\r\n\r\nDy\u2019s group consists of two members who live in the same village. Both of them are in the first-time microloan program with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. Dy is leading her group to request a loan of 500,000 KHR each. She is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland and pay for labor fees. She hopes this loan will help her to improve her productivity so she can sell the rice for a good price and earn a better living.

She is 26 years old. She is divorced and raising a daughter. For 2 months already, she has been motivated to start her own business, but doesn't have sufficient funds to do so.  To organize your business, she took the \"Bring Success\" course, organized by the women's business association, and received a certificate.

For many years she has been working in the school in her city, where first she worked as a security guard and later as a cleaner.  After many months, she was named the director of the cafeteria in the school, and this is how she began to buy an assortment of soft drinks, sweets, and various foods with the small amount of savings that she had.

When she has no customers to tend to or clothes to repair she goes out to sell the items she\u2019s made.  She hopes later on to set up a well-equipped sewing workshop and start to expand her work in order to become a supplier to a large store in the city.\r\n\r\nThis is her 10th MFP loan and she feels grateful to the people who provide the financing she needs to realize her plans.  On the other hand, she commits to make her installment payments punctually and hopes to continue working with her communal bank because of the fellowship and mutual support they have among each and every one of the members.  She will use the requested 1,200 soles to buy materials like buttons, lace trim, thread in assorted colors, elastic and fabric to continue with her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1210672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy buttons, lace trim, thread in assorted colors, elastic and fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":182.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":191.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":190.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":205.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":217.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.96,"local_amount":373.79,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":385.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447627},{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":190.38,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":196.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053525},{"amount":81.28,"local_amount":205.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":211.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188463},{"amount":84.31,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":219.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572382},{"amount":86.09,"local_amount":217.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":224.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122045}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T09:16:02Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":477853,"name":"Rukhsana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Rukhsana is a 41-year-old married woman.

She's single but has three children and lives in her own house with only her youngest, her son-in-law, and her grandson.\n\nJalia's main work is selling groceries.  She has set aside a small space in her house where she sells the main staple items, such as rice, sugar, oil, eggs, milk, bread, tea, and other things.  She goes to the market frequently to buy the products she sells, spending 250-300 soles [PEN].  \n\nShe works alone all day in this job.  She has been in this business for more than six years and fortunately hasn't suffered any significant economic losses since she started.  In the winter she also sells chickens because at that time of year the selling price for this product goes up and this is favorable for her.\n\nWhat she likes about her job is that it allows her to have an income, which helps her meet the basic household expenses.  She also can manage her finances in an organized way while looking toward the future.

existing resources. Saodat is one such person who is trying to improve her living standard and jump-start the economic situation of her family. She is divorced and has two children at home. Her husband is now re-married to another woman and has left to live in the Russian Federation. Saodat used to bake pies which her children sold at the bazaar, but her income from this business was small so she learned how to sew \"kurpacha,\" or traditional national blankets. She also took a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. Now Saodat is fully capable of organizing her own business and becoming successful at it. She wants to set up a business sewing and selling national blankets.

She lives in the company of her youngest son, Jhojan, who she cares for in her own home.  She is proud because she is a woman like no other.  She cared for her four children on her own.  Now she is in a delicate state of health because she had an accident that injured her knee in such a way that it bothers her when she walks.  Her main way of earning a living is selling basic goods in an air-conditioned space in her house.  Her store is well stocked; she has sweets, meat, and drinks of every variety.  But since she is a country woman she continues to plant potatoes, beans, and grains on her own land, which she tends to with much care although she still cannot clean the crop products on her own due to the lesion in her knee.  She is also happy to care for her animals like pigs, guinea pigs, and chickens, which she sells when they are mature.  \"To be in the fields is my greatest pastime and medicine,\" she says.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Luchadoras\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP.

She is not married, but she lived many years with a man that she loved, with whom she had 12 children.  When they separated Blanca worked hard to keep her family moving forward on her own.  Today her children are adults and independent.  She lives in her own house with one of her children and a grandson and granddaughter.  Blanca runs a grocery store from her house, from which she attends to her clients, most of whom are her neighbors, in a friendly and cordial way.  She sells important household products such as rice, bread, milk, eggs, vegetables, etc.  Since most of the products are perishable she renews her inventory every week and spends about 100 to 150 soles each time.  She has been running this business for about 3 years by herself.  She also sells various medicinal drinks made from the roots and bark of trees from the Amazon, which she has been doing for 5 years.  She likes her business because it allows her to be in her house and at ease because of the income, she is also able to employ people to work in her home.  She does not like it when her clients want to run a tab in her store because in the past she has had bad experiences with people not paying.  However, after seeing the good results from her experiences she is planning to expand her business.  She also wants to acquire a mototaxi in order to rent it out and make more money.  This is her 9th loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has the support from them so she can continue working worry free.  For her part, she will continue to make punctual payments as she has always done.  She feels comfortable belonging to a community bank because all of the members are responsible and caring.  With the 1000 soles that she is asking for she will buy more merchandise to continue selling.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1207024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase important household products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":155.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":151.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":164.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":173.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":183.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.4,"local_amount":155.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447671},{"amount":60.43,"local_amount":151.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":157.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053569},{"amount":65.9,"local_amount":164.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":171.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188507},{"amount":68.35,"local_amount":170.89,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572422},{"amount":69.55,"local_amount":173.86,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":180.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122084},{"amount":73.37,"local_amount":183.43,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":190.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867903}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T09:24:53Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":474627,"name":"Bonanza  (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Bonanza est\u00e1 conformado por 8 mujeres que viven en diferentes lugares de la ciudad de Cuenca, ciudad que se caracteriza por su clima,  su centro nos regala im\u00e1genes de su historia colonial y se encuentra rodeada de 4 r\u00edos.

She lives with her husband, Arturo, and three of their five children: Patricia, Teresa, and Piero, whom she cares for in the house that she inherited 27 years ago. She has 18 years of experience in raising animals and in growing potatoes, carrots, corn, and alfalfa, which serve to increase her earnings. All her family participates actively in these activities, which are considered family businesses. It is for this reason that in the mornings she goes out to take her animals to graze in the fields, and at her house she also feeds them the alfalfa that she gets from her cultivated land. After a number of months she sells her animals, the majority of which are bulls, either alive or butchered, from which she gets more earnings. Another way she has to generate income is renting out her bulls for plowing. It is for this reason that she aspires in the future to have more head of cattle. For now she is concentrating on planting, since she already has orders to send to the capital of the country. She belongs to the communal bank \"Sicaya 2000,\" and this is her 10th loan from MFP. She feels happy since during this time she succeeded in obtaining good earnings, all thanks to the economic help that they offered her. For this reason she promises to make her payments. In addition, she likes to work in her association, where the members are united and hard-working people. Francisco will invest the money in the purchase of 10 cans of carrot seeds, and if there is enough money, she will buy a number of bags of natural fertilizer to nourish her plantings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1205040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 10 cans of carrot seeds and natural fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529174}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T17:22:20Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":475730,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel lives in the Mariakani area of Coast Province, Kenya.

The organization works to offer reliable, efficient, and affordable technologies to households to improve their livelihoods. \n\nWork in this sector began at SOSAI in 2010. The organisation had existed as a fully commercial company before this, but now we operate as a social enterprise. \n\nSOSAI was set up by Habiba, who is a founder, and who had worked for Developmental Association for Renewable Energies (DARE), where she had got the opportunity to carry out exhibitions and workshops for people in rural areas and urban slums highlighting the benefits of renewable energies. Because DARE is an NGO sales were limited by DARE, so Habiba decided to branch out to revive SOSAI. With benefitting people at the forefront, running this organisation as a social enterprise was paramount. \n\nThe idea behind the project of creating micro-enterprise by providing solar lighting is to empower small entrepreneurs who can penetrate more communities by giving them the opportunity to buy products and pay for them in installments, with an agreed upon plan and model. This will develop micro-enterprise, especially for women, while ensuring that a large number of people get all-important lighting into their homes, at the same time empowering more by giving them a means of livelihood. With the high number of households not connected to the grid--despite its rich energy resources--Nigeria is a fertile ground to grow this business as in the past 10 years (in spite of the government's promises) the power sector has only worsened with more power cuts and fewer people being connected to the grid. \n\nAccording to the WHO 1.6 million deaths occur yearly from indoor air pollution; this project will in the long run reduce green-house gas emissions while improving maternal health and ensuring basic education as longer study hours will be ensured. \n\nBenefits accruable to using Solar Home Systems as provided by Barefoot Power are immense, but the most important reason for SOSAI undertaking this comes from a personal experience Habiba has had with kerosene lamps while assisting her mother who owned a \"Bukka,\" a term used to describe a small eatery, where they worked till late at night using kerosene lamps. Her mother currently has an eye problem because of the exposure to indoor air pollution and Habiba herself wears glasses. What better drive to promote a cleaner source of lighting than personal experience? \n\nThe business model will be fully developed to include training for the business owners and training of technical staff that will ensure the warranty Barefoot Power prides itself in. \n\nThis loan will enable SOSAI to better promote this sales model and move deeper into the rural areas especially to give the organization the strength to be able to fall back and take on the steam at any time. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":22975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":22975,"image":{"id":1249366,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2769,"youtubeId":"8sx18jjZOCQ","title":"Kiva Borrower Habiba from Nigeria","thumbnailImageId":1249366},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To sell solar lighting to people who don't have electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T09:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T09:00:07Z","loan_amount":22975,"lender_count":710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":22975,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":22975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6975},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10000,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778967},{"amount":7000,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-18T09:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449554753},{"amount":5975,"local_amount":5975,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459021136}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T20:49:27Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":480424,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":16000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To sell renewable solar lighting ","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T09:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T09:10:01Z","loan_amount":16000,"lender_count":501,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":16000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419778966}],"funded_date":"2012-10-10T16:42:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":480828,"name":"Dossou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr Dossou est un jeune commer\u00e7ant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 29ans.

Over the years, he gained a lot of buyers which led to him not being able to produce enough to meet demand.  For this reason, he started renting additional land so that he could produce more.  He has 20 years experience not only in farming but also in cattle farming as he buys and sells cattle.  He has two cows and one bull.  On market days he travels to the cities of Chupaca and Jauja to sell his animals.  \"If I sell my animals in the village my profits are minimal so I travel to the cities because I make more money there.  It's the same with my crops which I sell in the capital.  I hire a truck and I do the journey myself\", he says.\r\n\r\nThis is Armando's fourth loan from MFP and he is grateful for the support that he has received over the years as it has helped him to make progress and improve the capital he has available for his business activities.  For this reason, he pledges to be punctual in making his repayments as he was with his previous loans.  Armando will invest the money he has requested in buying 200 sacks of natural fertilizers to spread over his next crop of potatoes.  He will also buy an additional cow so that he can continue making progress in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1205170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 200 sacks of fertilizer and a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":451.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":453.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":473.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":487.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":502.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":529.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":543.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":559.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":174.83,"local_amount":451.18,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":453.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447695},{"amount":175.66,"local_amount":453.32,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":455.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053596},{"amount":183.51,"local_amount":473.56,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":476.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188533},{"amount":188.77,"local_amount":487.14,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":489.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572447},{"amount":194.66,"local_amount":502.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":505.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122109},{"amount":205.03,"local_amount":529.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":532.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867926},{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":543.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":547.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576834},{"amount":216.79,"local_amount":559.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":562.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529178}],"funded_date":"2012-10-29T21:09:21Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":478124,"name":"Union Y  Esfuerzo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupos solidario formado por tres socios microempresarias exitosa que tienen diferentes actividades como do\u00f1a C\u00e1ndida que se dedica a la venta de nacatamales y pan desde hace dos a\u00f1os, adem\u00e1s tiene animales de patio como 20 gallinas, 6 patos, y 6 chompipes.(pavo)\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo utilizara en la compra de cerdo, hojas, arroz, le\u00f1a, especies, sal, papas etc. y compra de alimentos para sus animales de patios.\nDo\u00f1a Mercedes se dedica a la venta de nacatamales desde hace 7 a\u00f1os en su domicilio, do\u00f1a Br\u00edgida hace sopas los fines de semanas, en su domicilio\n \n","en":"This solidarity group is made up of three members, successful microentrepreneurs with different businesses.

One of her children is studying at university whilst the other is still in high school.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Dorotea gets up at the crack of dawn to go and work as a farm laborer, for which she receives a daily wage.  This allows her to meet her daily household expenses.  She makes the most of any free time she has to put her knitting skills to use.  She always carries her knitting needles and yarn in her bag with her so that she can knit hats, scarves and sweaters which she then sells to customers who she has gained through her hard work over the years.  Now Dorotea would like to work a lot more carefully as her son will soon finish his higher education.\r\n\r\nThis is Dorotea's fifth loan from MFP and she is grateful for the support she receives as it has helped her to cover some of her business expenses.  She pledges to be a responsible person and make her loan repayments on time.  Dorotea will invest her money in buying skeins of yarn for her knitting.  She will save money by buying wholesale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1205189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy skeins of yarn in different colors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-05T13:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-04T13:50:14Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorotea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":107.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":113.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":117.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":121.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":126.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":136.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":142.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.02,"local_amount":107.56,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":111.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447697},{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":113.22,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":117.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053598},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":117.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":122.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188535},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":121.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":126.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572449},{"amount":50.64,"local_amount":126.59,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":131.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122111},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":133.51,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":138.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867928},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":136.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":142.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576836},{"amount":57.13,"local_amount":142.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":148.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529180}],"funded_date":"2012-10-05T15:22:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":477957,"name":"Khitam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khitam is a 43-year-old married woman who has three family members from Al Russeifeh, Jordan.

He is single and lives by himself near a town; all his family members live in the country's mountains. He has his own house, from which he works day after day to create a better quality of life for himself. Gregorio's work consists of farming; he earns his living planting and harvesting two fundamental crops of the region where he lives. He grows oil palms, and that yield is sold to a very big oil-producing company. He also grows cacao, which he sells to various buyers who come from the capital looking for cacao, since the region produces the best of that fruit. Both crops are encouraged as alternatives to growing coca leaves. Gregorio has been working with cacao for six years and oil palm for four years. He does this alone, and when it is planting or harvesting season, he contracts workers who help him fill his orders on time. He considers his business profitable because of the demand and the good earnings he is left with.\r\n\r\nGregorio likes his work because he is in contact with nature and it is an environment in which he feels very comfortable. He loves what he does and it's going well since he is selling his yield at a good price.

This school was founded in 1973. Teachers of the school have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan. They are requesting a loan of 13,700,000 Sierra Leonean Leones for the entire group. With the help of this loan, these teachers will be in a better position to buy or invest in something that their mere salaries cannot let them do.\r\n \r\nMassah is the leader of the group.

This is Betty, 50 years old and from Kandeh town, Southern area Bo District. She is married, with four children between the ages of 20 and 32 years. One of her children is attending school. \r\n\r\nBetty runs a gari business, in Kandeh town.  She sells garie. She has been running this business for more than ten years. She works at the business from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., 7 days a week.  Betty says the main challenges to her business are competition in the market and lack of enough capital to take care of her home. She also receives income from her husband, who also helps her to take care of the home. \r\n\r\nBetty has requested a loan to buy more product of gari and palm oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her installment. In the future, she wants to expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1205081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
