He is working hard on including the glass in his business, which will be a good step towards a wider market.\r\n\r\nHe is looking forward to his new life and for this important step he is going to take.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1205797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"To pay for his marriage legal documents and to finish pasting tiles in his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T05:00:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310164},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331050535},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440465},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993155},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735764},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441152},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846387},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614619},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472127},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728232},{"amount":87,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997173}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T11:50:22Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:10:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":478590,"name":"Leila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leila is from Iraq.

He offers his services as a bricklayer and works on construction jobs in different provinces and in the city.  Eleuterio also has dairy cows, three of which are producing and another that is pregnant.  He delivers the milk to a processor for making cheese and other dairy products, which are then sold in a town near his community.  In addition, Eleuterio grows potatoes and sells his harvest in the market square once a year.  \r\n<p>\r\nEleuterio took out his first Kiva loan in August 2010.  The loan he requested was used to build and improve the rooms in his home because he was starting a family.  He is very grateful for that loan because it gave him the opportunity to improve his home and provide his wife a better space to live as a family.  \r\n<p>\r\nEleuterio is currently growing in his construction jobs, so he wants to buy a cement mixer that he needs for his work.

She sells seafood including shrimp, fish and conch. She has several years of experience with small businesses which has given her valuable experience. Irma always gets the best profits from sales, and the place where she does business is very crowded with people.  She has many customers who prefer her because everything she sells is top quality, fresh and at reasonable prices. But more than anything she provides excellent service. Irma is an enterprising woman, dedicated to her work and is eager to get ahead and create a more prosperous future. She knows that it will take all of her effort and persistence to reach this goal that she so wants.

She lives with her husband and their three children who are between 12 and 19 years old.  Idalis owns a workshop where she makes men's, women's and children's clothing.  For many years Idalis worked making clothing for third parties.  Large companies would deliver the items of clothing to her already cut out so that she would sew them together in her workshop and finish them off using her creative skills.  Eight years ago, she decided to start working for herself and start her own business so that she could be closer to her three children and take care of them while she made money to improve their well-being.  Now Idalis makes shirts, pants, blouses and Bermuda shorts which she sells to neighbors and family members.  She has the support of her sister who delivers her products to other towns near Soledad where she lives.  \r\n\r\nIdalis is applying for this Kiva loan to buy materials for her business such as fabric, buttons and thread.

In order to improve himself, he is studying for a teacher training degree on weekends so that he will have his degree and therefore a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOwing to the low salaries that are paid in our country, many people are unable to fulfill their dreams of training to become a professional, doing the same for their children and managing to own a decent home.  However, there are also tenacious people who seek a way to achieve their goals.  This is the case for Yader who has requested a loan to pay his university fees so that he won't face any obstacles in obtaining his teaching degree.\r\n\r\nYader is grateful to Kiva and Ceprodel for the support they have given him through these loans which help him to solve personal problems which, owing to the low salaries in our country, he would otherwise be unable to solve.\r\n\r\n*(line from a well-known Nicaraguan song)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1207555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay university fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T10:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T10:50:19Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yader Eulogio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":353},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":458.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":468.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":482.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":507.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":513.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":531.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":545.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":563.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":575.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.89,"local_amount":353,"processed_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":378.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322964799},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":458.59,"processed_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":491.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331950978},{"amount":21.07,"local_amount":468.16,"processed_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":501.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339488979},{"amount":21.72,"local_amount":482.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":517.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347041667},{"amount":22.83,"local_amount":507.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":543.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356473577},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":513.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":550.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364493560},{"amount":23.92,"local_amount":531.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":569.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373114870},{"amount":24.56,"local_amount":545.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":585.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381674559},{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":563.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":604.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390538846},{"amount":25.91,"local_amount":575.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":617.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788097}],"funded_date":"2012-10-07T14:53:01Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":478615,"name":"Hilaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilaria is 57 years old and from Antequera, Bohol.

Una vez admitido en alguna de las mejores universidades de ese pa\u00eds, Alejandro est\u00e1 seguro que gracias a sus buenas notas, experiencia en el medio  y sus proyectos sociales podr\u00e1 lograr el apoyo de una beca que financie sus estudios.

He was able to study social communication at the Public University of Valle because he received financial support from the state for his excellent academic record and his family's limited financial situation.  Currently, Alejandro and his brother only have their mother's financial support since his father died some time ago.  \r\n\r\nAlejandro is passionate about technology and his dream is to study for a Master's degree in sound design in the United Kingdom.  Once he is admited to one of the best universities in Colombia, he is sure that his good grades, media experience, and social projects will allow him to receive a grant to finance his studies.  Now, he is asking for this Kiva loan because it is the only way he can pay for a TOEFL preparation course and the exam fee, which are the first things he has to do to achieve his dream.  \r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nThe great passion of my life is music and sound.  I have received music education since I was very young.  I started studying my first musical instrument when I was eight years old.  More recently I have participated in opportunities that have allowed me to develop my talent and that of many other young people for social transformation through the media, spreading messages of well-being, hope, knowledge, and development.\r\n\r\nMovies are another one of my hobbies, and for that reason I have worked on short and long films since high school.  I made academic and financial effort to study at the school of social communication at the University of Valle, which is known for its emphasis on audiovisual studies and its alumni filmmakers.  \r\n\r\nFor the last few years, I have been developing and participating in projects that fuse audiovisual with music and sound.  I have a music blog and have played in groups.  I have designed some sound pieces for short films being edited and I have also worked as a DJ.\r\n\r\nHowever, at this time my dream is to bring my talent to the next level and that is why I want to learn the art of sound design from the best.  I have chosen to study in the United Kingdom, among other reasons, because of the affinity I feel for their contribution to world culture through music and their world famous quality in sound engineering.  \r\n\r\nOnce I return to this country, I dream of contributing socially in Colombia by creating my own digital media company where I advise young people from marginalized areas on audiovisual techniques, using social media, and community video oriented to sound, music, and sound design.\r\n\r\nThe support of Kiva is without doubt the most important tool that I have to take the first step necessary to achieve my dream.  This loan will cover the cost of a preparation course for the English proficiency exam as well as the cost of enrolling at one of the universities I plan to apply to.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1208304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his application costs for a Master's degree in Sound Design for Film and Television.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75009.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042088},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75009.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710435},{"amount":9.68,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-24T08:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":18002.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.32,"payment_id":459082493},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":84010.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895249},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":160020.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118017},{"amount":62.78,"local_amount":113000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-18T09:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":113014.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812852},{"amount":191.17,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-23T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":375047.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.16,"payment_id":561631628}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T02:27:33Z","paid_date":"2014-11-23T10:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":479668,"name":"Aida Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aida tiene 27 a\u00f1os y trabaja en un negocio que hered\u00f3 de su familia.

Her business is offering salon services to the residents in the area where she lives. Many people from her neighborhood and from others go directly to her business to get their hair cut, improve their image and buy beauty products such as creams, shampoos and other merchandise. Twelve years ago, because of the scarce employment opportunities in her town, Edith decided to start her own business and now the income help her and her young son. That is the reason she is turning to a Kiva loan to buy products for her hair salon and to sell articles to her customers at a reasonable price and within the time frame they need to buy it. Edith knows that having a business is a lot of work, because she works 12 hours a day. She has big goals of expanding her space and generating employment for other people.

She is married and has two children aged 35 and 27. In 2007, she established her grocery store business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used it to buy grocery goods for her business. In the future, Dhan Kumari plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

She is married and has two children aged 30 and 27. In 2000, she established her vegetable-farming business. Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loans to buy seeds and fertilizers. In the future, Durga plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1205977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Durga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-23T10:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489512},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094489},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200721},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340415863},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347170989},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355913212},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-23T09:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624189},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-19T09:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020189},{"amount":30.68,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":381808018},{"amount":29.94,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":390668081},{"amount":58.11,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5346.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.39,"payment_id":400621597}],"funded_date":"2012-10-07T16:21:30Z","paid_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":478680,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 50 years old and lives in Buchanan.

She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNenita dreams to be able to give her family a good life and hopes to give her children and grandchildren a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This type of work allows her to generate income to support her family since she is married and has two daughters.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she said that she likes the health and financial trainings because they provide detailed explanations for things.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1208423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T18:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T18:00:42Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sinforosa Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10606.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1628.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1795.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1787.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1803},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1795.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1795.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.03},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":261.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":238.03,"local_amount":1628.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1644.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095506},{"amount":262.39,"local_amount":1795.44,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1813.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235581},{"amount":524.78,"local_amount":3590.83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617414},{"amount":262.39,"local_amount":1795.44,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1813.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172008},{"amount":262.41,"local_amount":1795.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914228}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T04:10:16Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":478975,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 53 years old and widowed with 2 children.\r\n\r\nSarah works hard to provide for her family.

She has built up a good customer base since people like her because all her food is made of top quality ingredients as well as being hygienic and sold at accessible prices, but above all because of the excellent service.\r\n\r\nBlanca is an enterprising woman and dedicated to her work. She is always looking for new opportunities that will allow her to achieve success and will not tire until she reaches a more prosperous future. \r\n\r\nLike any good trader, she wants to invest to

Ella estima que la temporada en donde los estudiantes de escuelas y colegios inician su per\u00edodo normal de clases existe una mayor demanda por lo cual ella se acerc\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa a solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos que le permiten ofrecer variedad a sus clientes, pr\u00e9stamo por el cual est\u00e1 muy agradecida ya que con la asesor\u00eda y capacitaci\u00f3n recibida all\u00ed podr\u00e1 dar un mejor servicio a sus clientes y de esta forma posicionarse en el sector y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos que le permitan mejorar su calidad de vida ahora y para el futuro.","en":"Puyo is the capital of the province Pastaza, a province that forms an important part of the Amazon region of Ecuador because it is at the center of the Amazon jungle. In Puyo you can enjoy a pleasant climate and a magnificent landscape with rivers, waterfalls, and a diversity of flora and fauna. Ecuadorians and foreigners alike come to delight in these attractions. Tourism is one of the most important economic activities in Puyo and in the city center you can easily find all of the services needed to accommodate tourists such as hotels, hostels, restaurants, banks, etc. People in this area also make a living in agriculture and livestock which are favoured because of the region's fertile land. Without a doubt, Puyo is a city worth visiting; it has grown a lot in recent years due to the entrepreneurial spirit and hard work of its people.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this city lives Magdalena, a woman who is 56 years old, single, and has completed her primary school education. She has four children who are now adults and therefore independent; but it is only thanks to her work have they have been able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, Magdalena launched a business selling staple goods, a trade she learned from her daughter-in-law who had experience because she came from a family of merchants. Magdalena invests between 12 and 15 uninterrupted hours every day to her work. She estimates that in the time when students from primary and secondary school start their normal period of classes, there will be an increased demand for the products she sells. For that reason, she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to ask for a loan in order to buy products that will allow her to offer a greater variety to her customers. She is grateful for this loan and for the assistance and training she received at the foundation, so that she may provide better service to her customers and in this way position herself in the industry, increase her income, and improve her quality of life both now and in the future.

She did not get married due to lacking the money for a wedding. Four years ago, she started a parlor in a small corner of her two-room house. Along with her younger sister Sameen, she works hard day and night to give the parlor a strong local reputation so that they may be able to provide for the family. \r\n\r\nFarzana and Sameen labor tirelessly to keep the business running because they are the breadwinners of the house. There are seven dependents on these two women since none of their siblings are old enough to earn themselves. Two of their sisters are enrolled in school. \r\n\r\nThe sisters have reported to Kashf that it has been getting extremely difficult to manage the family, as the parlor is running on minimal necessities, causing clients to be hesitant to avail themselves of the parlor's services. This is why Farzana has requested a loan worth RS 25,000 from Kashf. She tells us that she will be using the loan to invest in utensils, cosmetics, and some furniture items for the parlor.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1206717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in utensils, cosmetics, and some furniture items for her beauty parlor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1769},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1874},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1985},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2043},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2103},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2165},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2228},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2293},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2360},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.46,"local_amount":1769,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1846.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315428594},{"amount":20.03,"local_amount":1821,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1900.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323033748},{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":1874,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331169893},{"amount":21.22,"local_amount":1929,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2013.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339552641},{"amount":21.84,"local_amount":1985,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2072.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347102506},{"amount":22.47,"local_amount":2043,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2132.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355847680},{"amount":23.13,"local_amount":2103,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2195.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556359},{"amount":23.82,"local_amount":2165,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2260.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372954857},{"amount":24.51,"local_amount":2228,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2325.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381734702},{"amount":77.91,"local_amount":7083,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7393.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390821737}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T12:47:43Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":479054,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is a 34-year-old man married with three children and one wife.

For that, Safdar, as a member of a 10-person group, has requested a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a sewing machine to satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally. She hopes, with the help of the loan, to reach her desired net income and be able to save for their future. She dreams of giving her children a quality education. With the profit, she will open her own boutique in the future.
