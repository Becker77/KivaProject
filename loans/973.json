She began business 13 years ago selling soup, made of meat, vegetables, tubers and bulbs, which was served as part of lunch.  Income began to come in and business started going well, so little by little she added more menu items such as regular foods, complete lunches, natural fruit juices made with mango, n\u00edspero, guan\u00e1bana, corozo, and sweets and beverages.\r\n\r\nCurrently, through her business she has been able to increase her income and receive loans, 16 of which she has had through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the loans she has been able to make improvements at the restaurant, renovate her home and increase her working capital, because her business has much more variety.  Her sales volume has gone up and become more stable.  She buys her supplies at the town wholesale market and sells on a cash basis to neighbors.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting her first loan through Kiva to continue increasing her sales potential.

After she decided to follow in their foot steps, \u201cI realized this was my calling and I really enjoy helping people,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\nFor almost four years Bridgette, a mother of five, has led her team at Abundance of Love Home Care. Located in her hometown of St. Louis, \u201cAbundance of Love Home Care is an in-home service that assists individuals and families. We specialize in Alzheimer's and Dementia care. We are dedicated to helping our clients lead dignified, independent lifestyles in the comfort and safety of their homes by carefully assessing and fully understanding their needs, and selectively placing caring and trained personnel to meet those needs,\u201d Bridgette says. \u201cI have always wanted to become an entrepreneur. I always think of ways to make something better or how I can solve a problem.\u201d \r\n\r\nAbundance of Love Home Care is different from other assisted living business in the St. Louis area because \u201cwe dedicate ourselves to incorporating compassion in everything we do; we genuinely care about our clients and we ensure they are comfortable. We want to change the way home care is delivered and continuously give our clients that personal experience,\u201d Bridgette says.\r\n\r\nThough she has not personally had a family member with the disease, Bridgette said each of her caregivers are trained on what the disease is, its stages, and how it affects the family members and patients. She says she believes there are ways to keep patients safe while allowing them \u201cto live dignified lives for as long as they can, because there are some people who live alone with this disease,\u201d she says. \r\n\r\n\u201cCare goes beyond just feeding and bathing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea is to personalize every person's care by implementing specific physical and mental activities for as long as they can perform them and provide familiarity in their everyday lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nBridgette learned about Accion Texas Inc. via the Internet. She plans to use the loan to market her business and purchase technology that will make delivering care and ease communication between her employees and patient\u2019s family members by electronically sending patient information to family members and health care professionals. \u201cWith this loan I am able to invest in technology and stay innovative in the ever-changing field of healthcare,\u201d Bridgette says. \u201cI can also focus on marketing to get the business known.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe currently employs three workers and said her business \u201cnot only provides a service but more jobs in the community. I plan to hire more as the business grows. Without the loan, I would not have been able to revise the direction of my business plan in order for people to know Abundance of Love exists. This loan has allowed me to think bigger in the plans that I have. I am no longer limited because of lack of funds.\u201d\r\n\r\nFind out more about Bridgette\u2019s services by visiting her website at

He lives in the city of Mala, a city characterized by its agriculture, especially now that they cultivate apples and bananas, among other items. Zenon is a hard working man, above all because he has gotten his two children, 16 and 27 years old, ahead. A few years have passed since his wife died and from this moment he became the father and mother for his children. At first it was difficult, but his love of being a father was stronger. In his free time, which is limited, Zenon plays music and he is part of a small group. Occasionally, he likes to enjoy one of his usual meals, the rich soup with yuca and meat (\"Sopa bruta y Carapulcra\")  with his children. Due to his limited economic resources he could only study up to 5th grade, but he would have liked to study for a university degree.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort, and above all else savings, Zenon began his carpentry business 15 years ago. He works about 10 hours a day, but it always varies according to the jobs that his customers put him in charge of. On a daily basis he may work with up to 5 customers. He thinks his business does well because he is very responsible with his customers and above all else, he is honest. \r\n\r\nZenon is very grateful for the Kiva loans. Thanks to the help they have brought him he will be able to buy wood, and he can also improve the facade of his business so that it can be more colorful and attract more customers. This way he will be able to increase his earnings and he will continue fighting to make his biggest dream a reality: to give his children a good education and to have his own home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1203270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":["Vulnerable

She has a stand in the market where she sells fruit. She has been selling fruit for eight years! She will use the loan to buy avocados, pineapples, mangoes, and other fruits. Her business strategy is to buy a large sack of fruit in bulk from a village outside of Brazzaville and sell it in the market.

He lives with his wife and his four children ranging from age 10 to 18. He's a very hardworking person who has been working in agriculture for 20 years, growing corn, vegetables and plantains. He has learned this line of work from his father ever since he was very young. He buys the products and supplies in the city, where he acquires them at better prices.

Arcelis tiene un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os y una hija de 14 a\u00f1os, y por eso es muy importante para ella, que sus negocios tengan \u00e9xito, pues quiere garantizar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos con sus ingresos. Tambi\u00e9n, viven ahora en un lugar muy peque\u00f1o, sufriendo el hacinamiento, y espera usar sus ingresos para mejorar las condiciones de la casa y mudarse a un lugar mejor. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un cr\u00e9dito de Kiva,  primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para comprar materias primas e insumos y elaborar prendas de vestir a un buen precio, porque logrando descuentos puede ofrecerlo a su clientela y si tiene el dinero disponible para hacer su compra ahorrar\u00e1 mucho, en la compra de una buena cantidad de insumos, esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n de \u00e9xito de esta inversi\u00f3n. . ","en":"Arcelis, 39, lives in Barranquilla, a Colombian coastal city.  She has two businesses: a clothes making shop and she sells cheese.  She took a sewing course six years ago in a local public school and she and her husband took out a loan that she used to buy a sewing machine.  This is how she started her dressmaking business.  She also earns extra income selling cheese that she sells to a domestic clientele she\u2019s gradually built.\r\n\r\nArcelis has a five-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter and this is why it\u2019s so important that her businesses are successful because she wants to guarantee her children\u2019s education with her income.  In addition, they live in a very small place so are very overcrowded and she hopes to be able to use her income to improve her house and move to a better place.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy raw materials and supplies to make clothing at good prices because by qualifying for discounts she can then pass them down to her customers and if she has money in hand she can save very much when she makes her purchase by buying in volume which is precisely the reason why the investment will be successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1209829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

La sala funciona  todos los d\u00edas desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana, hasta las 9 de la noche. Es mucho trabajo pero a Norella no le importa, porque tiene que proveer ingresos, para apoyar el bienestar de su hijo de 10 meses, y por eso est\u00e1 intentando incrementar sus ingresos, para establecer unos montos de ahorros mensuales \u2013 y alg\u00fan d\u00eda, si gana suficiente dinero, obtener su propia vivienda.  \nNorella necesita y est\u00e1 aplicando a un cr\u00e9dito de Kiva,  para adecuar la infraestructura de su sala: va a comprar una impresora, un computador y cr\u00e9ditos para llamadas internacionales, porque quiere ampliar la cobertura de su negocio, con el fin de  que sus clientes est\u00e9n muy satisfechos y cada vez m\u00e1s confortables. Este ser\u00eda el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su raz\u00f3n de \u00e9xito radica no solo en su capacidad de trabajo y en sus propias motivaciones, sino tambi\u00e9n porque existe un potencial de mercado, que aun no ha explorado,  porque su capital de trabajo no ha sido suficiente para hacerlo.\n","en":"Six years ago, Norella Patricia noted that her house was well-situated for an Internet access room and that there were no others in the neighborhood.

It\u2019s a lot of work for Norella but she doesn\u2019t mind because she has to earn income to provide wellbeing for her 10-month-old son and this is why she\u2019s trying to increase her income to be able to set aside a monthly amount to save and someday, if she earns enough money, to buy her own house.\r\n\r\nNorella is applying for the Kiva loan she needs to properly equip her Internet access site.

Sizario is an honest and very hard working man but is always limited by capital. His dream is opening a supermarket in the city centre where he says turnover and profit margins are higher than where he is currently operating. Sizario faces several problems including poor means of transport, fluctuating prices for his products, which frustrates his customers and customers who receive credit and refuse to pay back.

He is a farmer who keeps local cows and grows passion fruits on a small scale for sale as his major sources of income. James has been in this business for the last six years and has experience in it. He, however, does not have enough capital and that is why he applied for a loan. Only 500,000 Ugandan shillings was approved.

has three people who are dependent on him.  He is a hardworking individual who got married at a very young age.  Ten years ago, he lived in the town of Villa Quiroga with his two children.  His children had to walk an hour to school.  For this reason, he bought a lot through great effort and work in the urban section of Chimore.  He now lives in a house where his children have better opportunities to continue their studies.  Adrian wants to continue assisting them so that they can pursue a higher education.  In order to support their children, he and his wife must work and help one another.

With the financing he will buy construction materials like rebar, corrugated metal roofing, wire, wood and cinderblocks.  \r\n\r\nJerry is grateful for the help that the Kiva lenders offer to people of limited resources and poor countries like Nicaragua."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1209910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to invest in home improvements and to buy construction materials like corrugated metal roofing, cement, sand and cinderblocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerry Gregorio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":479553,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is a 36-year-old business lady who sells fresh produce.

This is in order to save on rent, and also to provide her children with more comfort and improve their quality of life.   \n\nThis is the sixth time she is applying for a loan with IMPRO, and the fourth time with Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1197670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To replace the engine of one of her vehicles, and to do maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":48,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T21:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T21:30:12Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":68.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":69.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":71.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":77.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.95},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":336.2,"local_amount":336.2,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":336.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315423375},{"amount":277.68,"local_amount":277.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T10:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":277.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323028263},{"amount":280.94,"local_amount":280.94,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":280.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331164472},{"amount":355.81,"local_amount":355.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":355.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339547023},{"amount":149.37,"local_amount":149.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":149.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097074}],"funded_date":"2012-10-15T22:21:44Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:44:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":479562,"name":"Samuel Nigo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a 38-year-old businessman who lives in Juba.

She wants to provide a better future for her children.\r\n\r\nMaricela is asking for this loan to make improvements to her home, including repairing the front door, and replacing two doors that are completely rotted due to moths.  She has wanted to make these improvements since she acquired the property, but has not been able to do so due to lack of financial resources.\r\n\r\nMaricela has worked with the foundation before and has demonstrated that she is responsible when it comes to making payments on time.

He grows corn and beans. He has worked in agriculture for several years and he has gotten valuable experience, which allows him to obtain the best crops. When he's not working on his crops, he works as a day laborer and a bricklayer, because this helps him pay for his household expenses. The plot of land where he sows is located in a highly agricultural area that's very close to his home. He makes his sales in all the neighboring areas and he has gotten a lot of customers. His customers prefer to go to him because everything he sells is high quality at accessible prices, and he provides good service. Ismael is an active man who's dedicated to his work and has a lot of drive to get ahead. He's always seeking opportunities that allow him to succeed. He believes in working hard and persistently so that he doesn't give up halfway through. In the last few harvests he had many problems and losses, and he wishes to recover. He'll make a new investment which will allow him to increase production. For that reason he requests a loan from INTEGRAL so that he can purchase corn and bean seeds, fertilizer, insecticide, tools, etc. Ismael has a good credit record and he guarantees that he'll be able to repay the debt. At the same time, he hopes that he'll bring financial stability to his

Otavalo es una ciudad muy atractiva por la diversidad de su cultura por lo que es muy concurrida por turistas nacionales y extranjeros quienes en cada visita disfrutan de paisajes, fiestas coloridas y las costumbres de sus habitantes ind\u00edgenas y mestizos que provienen de legendarias historias y que han defendido su territorio desde siempre. Es un cant\u00f3n muy rico econ\u00f3micamente pues desde sus antecedentes ancestrales, fue considerado el centro de la industria artesanal y actualmente estos productos son cotizados en todo el mundo.  Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una industria que aporta a la econom\u00eda de esta ciudad, pues en la zona rural se pueden encontrar r\u00edos, lagos, cascadas, bosques que son muy visitados. Por la afluencia de turistas, comerciantes y habitantes de la ciudad, en el centro de la ciudad se puede encontrar gran variedad de negocios que tienen el objetivo brindar todos los servicios para quienes pasan por la ciudad, estos negocios var\u00edan entre hoteles, hostales, restaurantes, cafeter\u00edas, papeler\u00edas, tiendas de ropa, alquiler de computadores, internet, etc. \nEs as\u00ed como Manuel emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de elaborar pan en horno de le\u00f1a desde hace 30 a\u00f1os cuando sus padres le insertaron el inter\u00e9s por la experiencia que ellos ten\u00edan.

Otavalo is a city that\u2019s very attractive because of its diverse culture; it\u2019s very well-known by both national and foreign tourists who visit different vistas, colorful festivals and the culture of its indigenous and mestizo peoples that come from legendary histories and who have defended their territory since time immemorial. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an economically rich canton because it\u2019s been a center of craftsmanship since its most ancient origins and its products are today highly prized worldwide. Tourism is another industry that contributes to this city\u2019s economy because in this rural zone can be found rivers, lakes, waterfalls and forests that are highly visited. Because of the high number of tourists, merchants and residents in the city, one can find downtown a great variety of businesses that have as their main goal to offer all services to those passing through the city. These businesses range from hotels to inns, restaurants to cafeterias, bookstores, clothing stores, computer rentals, Internet access, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel started his business baking bread in a wood-burning oven 30 years ago when his parents injected him with interest in the experience they had.  Manuel spends a minimum of 8 hours daily baking and selling bread and he also finds the way to stretch his time to spend in his extra activity raising domestic animals.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAiming at keeping his family\u2019s tradition alive and to meet demand from his city\u2019s residents who always have a special preference for \u201cDon Manuel\u2019s\u201d bread, he tries to keep the business stocked with sufficient quantity to fill all orders placed.  Because of this, Manuel called on Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to find a loan whose funds will be used exclusively to buy flour and supplies to increase production.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his lack of formal education, Manuel has shown himself to be a good business manager and he\u2019s sure that with the guidance from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa executives he will be helped with the business so that he can use excess profits to start a savings account to cover his and his wife\u2019s old-age

Farzana knows the techniques of stitches very well and counts a good client list.  Her stitches are much appreciated in her community. \r\n\r\nHowever, because of increasing demand of customers and less capital in hand, she was facing difficulties in accomplishing the orders. It was due to these conditions that she contacted Kashf Foundation and decided to take a loan, instead of taking informal loan from the relatives. She is much satisfied with the support of Kashf foundation and now has requested a loan a second time. \r\n\r\nThis time she needs a loan of Rs 30,000 to purchase another stitching machine for her daughter. In this way, Farzana, with the help of her daughter, would cater to more clients without delay.

He grows corn and beans and has worked in agriculture for many years, gaining valuable experience that has allowed him to grow the best harvests. The fields where he grows have great agricultural potential, good for planting and very close to where he lives. He vends in all the areas surrounding the community and has many customers who prefer him because of the quality of his goods, the good prices, and above all for the excellent customer service. \r\n\r\nCornelio is an enterprising man with a strong desire to get ahead, so he approaches his labor with a great deal of effort and dedication. He is sure that's the only way to achieve the success he strives for. Last season, he took some losses because of the weather and would like to make them up. However, in order to do that he needs more capital to back him up. That's why he's requesting a loan from Apoyo Integral [Kiva field partner] that will allow him to buy corn, beans, insecticides, herbicides, etc. Cornelio has a good payment history according to those who know him. He readily takes on the responsibility for paying off the loan and holds hope that it will provide his family a richer life.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1210061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy corn, beans, insecticides, herbicides, etc...","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cornelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448464}],"funded_date":"2012-10-11T21:56:08Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":479602,"name":"Mchemunda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mchemunda is a married woman, with four children.

At the same time, she has faith that this will give her family a better quality of life.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1210074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy coffee beans, insecticide, herbicide, tools, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glendy Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399736505}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T08:53:59Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":479618,"name":"Muna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For cultural reasons Muna prefers that her photo is not on the Internet.

La actividad que realiza Mar\u00eda es la venta de bebidas gaseosas y cocos.

Instala una mesa con un congelador port\u00e1til y ah\u00ed coloca los productos que vende para su adecuada congelaci\u00f3n hasta el instante que el cliente viene a comprarle.

She lives with her spouse, H\u00e9ctor, with whom she has only one child, but she has 5 children from her previous partner. She lives in her own home with four of her children, who are growing up and share with her the desire to create a better quality of life for the future, for each one of the family members. To earn income Maria sells sodas and coconuts. She has a transportable sales stand, located in the fishing port of the city, where people frequently pass by looking for something refreshing, due to the intense heat which is brought on by the high temperatures. \r\n\r\nShe has a table with a portable ice box which is where she puts the products she will sell, so that they are kept cold up until the point the customer buys them. She sells peeled coconuts, so that the meat of the fruit can be eaten, and she also sells whole coconuts which are requested for the delicious and fresh coconut milk. She has had this business for over two years. She sometimes has the help of her husband. She said that what she likes about her job, is the income she sees each day, because with this product she always has the necessary income to be able to support her spouse with the household expenses. What she does not like about her job is that sometimes she has customers who are disrespectful because they are intoxicated. Sadly, in the area where she works there are many bars where a lot of liquor is sold. However, she has learned how to handle these types of situations and she always succeeds in handling things gracefully. She hopes to find a location where she can sell more comfortably, that first and foremost offers the security she is currently lacking. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she has taken out through MFP. She is thankful to all of the people who make her loans possible, to continue working with improved outcomes. She promises, once again, to make her payments on time like she has done with her previous loans. She is also thankful to be a part of her communal bank, because all of the members are responsible and supportive people. With the amount of 1000 nuevos soles she has requested, she will invest in the purchase of more sodas, of a variety of brands, sizes and flavors. She will also buy straws and plastic bags, so that she can provide better service with her coconut sales.

","en":"Horacio is a young, 21-year-old man.  He is single.  Because of the customs and traditions of the community to which he belongs, he only studied through primary school.  He lives in the canton of Santo Domingo in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.  Santo Domingo connects the mountain region with the costal region of Ecuador.  It is a city that has become a main commercial artery with various sectors of growth.  As proof, it has various enterprising families that started small businesses several years ago, and now they are small businesspeople that support the generation with employment.  Studies reveal that the businesses, for the most part, started empirically and have had acceptance due to tourists, businesspeople, and travelers passing through.  They are moving from one region to another, and it is also the third most populous city in the country.  Horacio lives in the Luz de Am\u00e9rica parrish in this canton, a sector that is considered the entryway to the province.  The richness of its land has been the birthplace of various food companies.  It is also the area that produces the most papaya and exotic fruit for export.  This is why the large majority of people in this parrish make a living through agriculture.\r\n\r\nHoracio always helped his parents with their bueinss and also got involved in his business.  Every day, he invests at least six hours in taking care of his crops and fruit.  Horacio is sure that his income can increase if he increases his work, which is raising chickens to sell.  This is why he requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where he found support with the speed and safety he was hoping for.  He also received advice on how to manage his business.  Horacio will use all of the funds from this loan to buy chickens as the first step in fulfilling his dream, which is to have a large farm so he can improve his quality of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1210045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy chickens to later sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Horacio Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":85.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":80.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":81.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382704},{"amount":83.78,"local_amount":83.17,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989789},{"amount":171.67,"local_amount":170.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":171.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516797},{"amount":87.52,"local_amount":86.88,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":87.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068654},{"amount":179.82,"local_amount":178.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":179.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524851},{"amount":138.03,"local_amount":137.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":138.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313704},{"amount":140.64,"local_amount":139.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":140.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565310},{"amount":1.16,"local_amount":1.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814360},{"amount":191.31,"local_amount":189.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":191.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320540}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T16:04:32Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":479750,"name":"Adelein Conception","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelein Conception is 39 years old and has one school-aged child.

He's also responsible for selling coffee in a coffee processing plant.  He's married and has four children, whom he has taught the necessary knowledge so that one day they, too, can do the same work.  In the last harvest Rogelio produced twelve tons of organic coffee, which he delivered in its entirety to the Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco to be processed and exported.\r\n\r\nHe would like to increase his production, and to make this possible he needs to plant new coffee plants because some of the ones he has already have finished their life cycle.  To do this he needs a loan, which he'll repay at the end of the next harvest.\r\n\r\nIn the future Rogelio would like to be able to acquire more land to grow coffee.  Among his personal goals is for his children to get a college education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1209975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to re-plant his coffee farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12232.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936749}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T23:23:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":479755,"name":"Rey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farming is the primary source of income for Rey's family.

He used to help his father in the fields when he was a boy and he has lots of experience with all types of crops.  He\u2019s married to Irma and they have seven children who help him do his work on his land during their vacations, as they still attend school.\r\n\r\nMarcelino says that his previous harvest was not very good, because the climate was not ideal for coffee, however this year it will be much better.  He is asking for this loan so that he can hire field hands who will help him with the next coffee harvest.\r\n\r\nAside from raising coffee, he also raises sugar cane, lemon, and honey.  This helps him increase his family income.  He would like to enlarge his home in the future because he has a large family and it would allow them to live more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1210590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to hire field hands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T04:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T04:10:23Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6087.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810697}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T01:56:23Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosana oversees operations of their jeepney* transportation business. She has one, 14-16 person capacity, jeepney for which she is paid boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosana dreams to have another jeepney and hopes to give her children a good quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney: open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

On this occasion, we are visiting her so that she can tell us about her business.  Graciela says that she is 38 years old and has been married to Jes\u00fas for 20 years.  Together they have formed a family with five children who attend school.  In addition to having the children as dependents, they are also responsible for Jes\u00fas' mom as she is elderly and widowed.  Graciela tells us \"I have a butcher's shop which is a business I started together with my husband one year and ten months ago.  We started it because my father-in-law used to have a butcher's shop and it was a good butcher's shop.  However, when he died it passed into my brother-in-law's hands.  My husband also wanted to set up his own butcher's shop and so we set one up.  We rent our business premises.  We started out with an old display case and a meat grinder.  We couldn't buy new furniture because it was all very expensive.  We gradually bought a meat saw, a new display case and a new freezer because the one that we had cost too much to run.  We bought all these items through loans.  We are requesting a new loan from Visi\u00f3n Found, so that we can make our last payment on the meat grinder.  We would also like to buy more cattle because recently they have become too expensive.  This is one of the biggest difficulties we face.  The price of cattle has shot up and often we can't pay for them immediately.  Very often we ask the cattle farmer if he can wait a certain amount of time before we pay him.  Some cattle farmers are very understanding of the fact that we can't pay immediately but we have also met farmers who are not understanding and we have to pay them immediately with what we have available.  This means that we often have to request loans.  However, we have been able to get by and we have improved our business a lot because when we started out we only used to slaughter one or two animals a week.  Now we are killing three or four animals a week.  We have managed all this as a result of my husband's experience as he learned the business when he was very young, when he was 15 years old.  My husband has always encouraged us to work very hard and work a lot so that we can make progress with our business.  We always try to provide a very good service to our customers.  We try to be very humanitarian with them.  We make sure that the cattle farmers who sell us their animals do not sell us animals that have been raised with Clembuterol because we know that this is very bad for our customers.  We do not want to lose customers and so we try not to raise our prices so that our customers don't feel a sharp blow to their wallets.  We do this because we understand that very often they don't have enough money to buy more food.  We hope to eventually have two further butcher's shops where we will have employees.  We want to help people who really need a job.  I would also like my children to study for a degree so that they can at least work\".\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1209089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle and to finish paying for a meat grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T12:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T12:40:08Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3454.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3534.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3617.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3701.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3788.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3876.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3967.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4059.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":830.86,"local_amount":10606.7,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10648.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392182},{"amount":1519.14,"local_amount":19393.3,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":19469.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120044}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T14:24:08Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":479847,"name":"Amal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amal is a 46-year-old married woman who supports three family members from Sahab, Jordan.
