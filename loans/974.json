She is married to Arnulfo, a driver, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while also operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAna oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one-unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, for which she is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day. To help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, as well as for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAna dreams to have her own house and lot and hopes to give her children a good quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, which is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1208786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

Her family lives in a rural area of the Bakan district of Pursat province, Cambodia. To earn a living, she has farmed rice on three-hectare of farmland for several years while supplementing that income by selling fish in the local area. The current business earns her about 20,000 KHR and allows her to save about 5,000 KHR each day after daily expenses for future needs.

She is 60 years old and lives with her husband and two grown sons. Eteri is a pensioner. Her elder son takes wood from the forest and sells it in his village and nearby villages. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they run a small dairy farm of four milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Eteri produces cheese products and sells them at the local open market. In addition, the family owns a vineyard and agricultural land where maize is grown. They do all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested production is sold locally.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to purchase food for the cattle.

She plans to use the loan to buy rice, beans, sugar, salt, cooking oil, sweets, soft drinks, canned goods, flour, toilet paper, and toothpaste.  She wants to restock her business and continue with her sales.  She hopes that her business continues growing.  That way she will be able to give her son more education, and she will be able to give him the opportunity to study for a career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7350,"image":{"id":1209118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery store items to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Corrales, Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":7350,"lender_count":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":94000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392185},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120047},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068094},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284832}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T18:43:18Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":479939,"name":"Scott","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Support a NY born and raised film entreprenuer!

That is why it is not in the photo with her merchandise and that the photo is of her clothing stand.  Her order arrives days later in order to start working with them at the start of November.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she has been working with fireworks for 18 years.  Her friend and Godmother of her children taught her this work, but unfortunately, she died.  She was the one who gave her the idea; she was a wholesaler.\r\n\r\nFelipa buys the fireworks and sells them by herself.  She tells us that she invests part and her income doubles.  Therefore, she has no large problems, and it always goes very well for her.  \r\n\r\nIt is only at this time that there is a big family problem.  Two of her children went to the United State two years ago, and she does not see them.  She is very sad and in despair about this.  She would like to see them again one day.  She only asks God to keep them well.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of all of this, she continues to be motivated by her three children who go to school.  She wants all of them to continue studying.

so.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1209120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 900 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVioleta hopes that her business will expand soon, and she dreams of helping those in need. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Single, he manages his household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRenan operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to factories and others of the like. Renan's regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 16,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nRenan hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being successful in life through all his hard work on his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The reason he is working so hard, he said, is because he wants to give the nephews and nieces a good life and education.\r\n\r\nFor the past 12 years, his primary focus has been on livestock husbandry (cows and goats) and he has been successful at it. Agron has been selling milk, baby calves, and goats to the locals and has bought modern equipment for milking the animals. Being happy with the earning, Agron is planning to expand  this business further in the very near future.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Agron is requesting a loan from VisionFund Albania through Kiva to help him build a stable for the animals before the bitter winter that his region is faced with, kicks in. Agron wants to assure each lender that he will pay the loan back on time with no doubt. \r\n\r\nAgron is photographed here with the machinery he uses to milk the

They live in their own house, which they built in an annex farm. Nerida is a young fighter. Her activity is agriculture for five years. With her partner, she is dedicated to intensive farm work. Also, she has to take care of her children and her home. \"The work is tiring, but if we don't work, there's no money\", says wisely. \r\n\r\nIn land she owns, she grows potatoes, peas, and beans. When the work is strenuous, she has to hire laborers to clean up the land. But on weekends, she takes the tools and heads to her farm to take care of it.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She buys supplies at wholesale and sells them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLetecia hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance

He was forced to install a good alarm system to deter similar attempts. \r\n\r\nBecause it hasn't been long since Mikhail opened his store--just a year and a half--he is trying to grow the business.

","en":"Mario is 32 years old, he is separated from his wife and he has one child he economically provides for. He has finished high school. He lives in Quito, the capital city of the Republic of Ecuador and also the second largest city of the country with more that 2 million citizens between natives and migrants for other cities and countries. Quito has been the meeting point of citizens coming from all provinces, thus creating a very colorful culture. It is embellished by wide streets and building decorated with Avant-guard designs hosting the offices of renowned companies of every line of business. There are churches, museums and parks whose structures enchant its national and international tourists. In the center-north of the city there are entertainment places such as restaurants, art galleries and discos worth a visit. Mario lives in \u201cLa Armenias\u201d, a neighborhood located in the Conocoto parish, in the north of the city. Also known as \u201cModern Quito\u201d, here it is where many companies constituting the economic core of the country have their main headquarters. This is a mainly residential sector, even if in some isolated areas some unfinished buildings can been seen.\r\nMario runs a locksmith\u2019s shop, an activity he has been engaged in since he was a child, almost 20 years ago, and that he has learned from his parents whom he has always helped. He works here 10 hours a day, offering this service he has succeeded in establishing notwithstanding the lack of working capital. Mario has requested a loan to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to improve the structure of his shop, as the working area of his shop is not covered and the weather can damage the equipment and materials he uses. He hopes that thanks to this change he will succeed in more easily winning his customers\u2019 trust, thus increasing his income and consequently succeeding in granting a better strand of living both to himself and to his

He plants tomatoes, chili and onion. His wife assists him in cultivating the plants and sells them at the market. Otniel is sure that the more vegetables he plants, then the more income that he could generate. Unfortunately, he has very limited capital to do so. This situation led him to request a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 7,500,000. Otniel would like to spend the loan on various vegetable seeds and fertilizer. Otniel really hopes that he could improve the business through this loan assistance.

Her family is a big family which in total has eleven members. Samai has nine children, two (daughters) of whom are dependent on her and still of school-age. \r\n\r\nTo support the family, Samai and husband plant vegetables such as cauliflower and garlic.  Having been in the current business for thirty years, Samai earns around 53,000 KHR per day, but the daily expenses for the family is quite big so there\u2019s approximately 16,000 KHR left for her savings. Samai has been with VisionFund for four cycles already, with which she succeeded in securing food needed in her family. \r\n\r\nSamai is in need of money to purchase seeds and fertilizers in order to smoothly operate her field of business.

The past loan enabled her to support her family, helping her purchase food. She can currently earn about KHR 50,000 per day, and manages to save about KHR 30,000 daily after setting aside funds for future daily expenses. Now she is leading her group to ask for a loan with VisionFund. As the leader, Kong will use her portion of the loan to buy more piglets to raise.

Having been in this business for sixteen years, she is able to earn about KHR 20,000 per day and manages to save about KHR 6,000 each day after offsetting daily expenses.

Tiene su puesto de ventas ubicado en uno de los principales mercados de la ciudad hasta donde traslada las carnes que ha solicitado previamente con un d\u00eda de anticipaci\u00f3n.

They live in her mother's house where they work hard every day to get ahead.  Alicia sells red meats, mainly pork and sometimes beef.  Every day she buys all her products at the wholesale market which sells certified meat for human consumption.\r\n\r\nHer stall is located in one of the main markets of the city and that is where she takes all the meat ordered the day before.  The demand for this type of meat is high, which means sales are always good.  Sometimes, though, she does not sell everything by the end of the day.  Before setting up this business she sold fresh fish.  She decided to change because she noticed that the business she is in now is more profitable.  For nine years she has been working alone and things are going well.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys about her work is the fellowship that exists among the merchants in her same line of business.  They all help each mutually to attract new customers.  The earnings from her sales help cover household expenses and allow her to save for any unexpected expense.  But, now her goal is to open a grocery store in her home for her children to run and help her out by generating extra income.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan through MFP and she is very grateful for the loan opportunity and financial backing she needs to get ahead.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time and continue working responsibly with the other members of her communal bank.\r\n\r\nThe 4,000 PEN will be used to improve her stall's infrastructure and to buy more meat.  She will also buy essential groceries to start setting up her grocery store little by little.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1211352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy wholesale meat and essential groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":579.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":639.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":663.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":667.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":712.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":736.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":472.44,"local_amount":1219.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053617},{"amount":257.02,"local_amount":663.27,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":668.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188554},{"amount":258.8,"local_amount":667.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":672.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572468},{"amount":276.25,"local_amount":712.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":718.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122130},{"amount":285.49,"local_amount":736.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":742.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867966}],"funded_date":"2012-11-09T09:33:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":482091,"name":"Bonheur Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Zuena, membre de l\u2019association de cr\u00e9dit \u00ab Bonheur \u00bb, est un entrepreneur tr\u00e8s ambitieux, \u00e2g\u00e9e d\u2019environ 43 ans, non mari\u00e9e, m\u00e8re de 3 jeunes enfants qui \u00e9tudient tous.

woman who lives in the city of Pisco with her partner.  She is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to do well in life.  Unfortunately, owing to a lack of financial means and the need to work in order to cover her expenses, Mirtha was unable to study to become a nurse, though she would have loved to have done so.  In her free time, she enjoys taking part in sports and she sometimes cooks a delicious 'duck with rice' to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of determination and commitment, and with the support of her mother, Mirtha set up a small business selling groceries and school supplies.  Every day she starts her work early in the morning.  She can work approximately 12 hours a day and believes that she is doing well in her business because she has good customers who like her services.\r\n\r\nMirtha is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to buy merchandise such as rice, sugar, oil, milk, noodles, tuna, etc.  She will also buy school supplies and a shelving unit.  This will allow Mirtha to keep her business better stocked and equipped.  She hopes, as a result, to increase her sales and her income.  This will be very helpful to her as she will gradually be able to finish building her house and, in the not-too-distant future, she would like to be able to start another

He dedicates himself to his work so he can feed and educate his children, not to mention that he wants to give his whole family a better quality of life. Carlos' work consists of transporting passengers within the city. He gets up very early to go out in search of would-be customers who want to go from one place to another in the city. He has done this job for more than 10 years, and it has given him the opportunity to grow little by little along with his family, but he has bigger dreams for the future. In addition to this work, he also sells alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and gelatins from his home. In the same vein, he built rooms on some space on his land that he can rent by the month at very good prices. What he likes most about his job is that he can take his children to school, transport his family and carry out other work responsibilities. He hopes that his businesses progress even more in the future, since he wants to develop another one raising chickens, although he needs to save a bit more money first. This will be his first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he is grateful for those who made this possible so he can continue toward achieving his goals. He also promises to make his payments on time. He enjoys being part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible people who stand by each other. With the loan, he plans to purchase some cases of beer and soft drinks, and use the remainder to refurbish some parts in his motortaxi and to renovate some of the windows in the rooms he rents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1211371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to refurbish his motortaxi and purchase cases of beer and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-10T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-09T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":239.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":248.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":267.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":276.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.98,"local_amount":217.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":226.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447716},{"amount":95.93,"local_amount":239.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":249.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053618},{"amount":99.51,"local_amount":248.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":258.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188555},{"amount":100.19,"local_amount":250.49,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":260.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572469},{"amount":106.95,"local_amount":267.38,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":278.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122131},{"amount":110.44,"local_amount":276.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":287.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867967}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T19:45:16Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":481266,"name":"Mar\u00eda Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Gloria esta solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para realizar un divisi\u00f3n en su vivienda y que le esta haciendo falta un cuarto.

They live in the Salcedo canton, located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces of the Ecuadorian sierra. In Salcedo there are various tourist attractions such as lakes and beaches that offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. Nonetheless, the main activity in this town is farming and to a lesser extent, livestock. The farming products that are sold the most are grains, such as peas, beans, lentils, lima beans and various fruits and vegetables. Milk and milk products are sold locally and what is left over is sent to the coast as processed products. Raising animals is also very favorable because of the pleasant climate enjoyed in the canton. Despite these productive activities, there are worrisome levels of illiteracy and poverty and a lack of basic necessitites such as sewer services, which only 25% of homes have.\r\n \r\nYolanda raises domestic animals such as pigs and guinea pigs. She also is a farmer. She works 8 hours a day and has 15 years experience in the business.

She lives with her son, her daughter-in-law, and a granddaughter, who is a student. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they have a small dairy farm of four milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Liana produces cheese to sell to local cheese retailers. In addition, they grow maize on a family-owned land. The harvested production is used to support the family needs. Liana and her daughter-in-law are also teachers at the local school, where they earn monthly salaries.\r\n\r\nLiana works hard, but the family still does not produce enough income to build savings and improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan in order to repair a cattle-shed. With the loan funds, she will purchase construction materials for building the shed. The existing one is too small and does not allow Liana to plan future expansion of the family\u2019s farming activities. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she intends to develop an animal husbandry business so that she can produce and sell more cheese. This will increase the family income and Liana will be able to finance the education of her granddaughter.

This is 38-year-old Betty from Moriba town in the southern area of Bo, Sierra Leone. She is married with three children between the ages of 3 years and 15 years. Her children attend school. She began this business because she wants to take good care of her family.\r\n\r\nBetty runs a dried fish business within a business market area. She sells dried fish. She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day; she will start to smoke the fish from 11:00 p.m. until the fish get dry. She also has two relatives who help her to run the business. Her business is the only income she has. Betty says that the main challenges to her business are the cost of transport and insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nBetty has requested a loan in order to buy more fish for sale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and open a savings account. In the future, she plans to export dried fish and build a house for her family. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1209842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish
