Thanks to the timely obtained financial help, her business not only stayed afloat, but gradually developed and grew.  She moved to a new retail location at the same market, where she previously worked.  Now, her sales have increased more.

She is married to Joey and the mother of their children. She and her husband manage their own household. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRodema oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business, the regular customers are from the local community.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVladimer has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\n<p>Vladimer will use his loan to build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and greenhouse cellophane and construct the greenhouse. He will use part of the loan to purchase organic fertilizer. Vladimer will sow different kinds of vegetables and greens. After fertilization and properly done agricultural work, he will get a good harvest. The harvested products will be sold at a good price, which will increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the family's living conditions.

She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, son, daughter, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Maia\u2019s husband works as a driver and her son is a worker. Both of them get a monthly income. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they have a small dairy farm with two milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Maia produces cheese and sells it in the capital city's supermarket. Maia works hard, but her family still doesn't have enough income to make some savings and improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nMaia requested a loan to renovate her house.

This is 45 -year-old Bintu from Southern area in Bo. She is married and has 4 children between the ages of 10 years and 25 years. Three of her children attend school. She started this business to generate income in the home.\r\n\r\nBintu runs a provision shop at the house she lives.  She sells sugar, biscuit, mayonnaise, cocoa and ovaltine.   She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day.   Sleep is the only thing that will prevent her from opening her business. Her children usually help her to run the business.  She does not have any source of income except her business. Bintu says that her business is running well and that she does  not have any competition in the area.\r\n\r\nBintu has requested a loan in order to buy a variety of stock such as sugar, biscuits, mayonnaise, cocoa, and ovaltine.   Her goal is to own a permanent structure for her business.  In the future, she hopes to open a big supper market. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1210309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She followed her sister's footsteps and learned from her how to prepare and sell fruit juices and ice-creams.  She has been involved in this activity for over ten years now and has become very proficient in her field.  Her products are in high demand in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nRokia was introduced to Soro Yiriwaso by a solidarity association in her neighborhood.  After taking four solidarity loans, and given the expansion of her business, she decided to apply for individual loans.  Rokia is now taking her third individual loan.  She has been a client of Soro Yiriwaso for seven years and has never experienced any repayment difficulty.  All her loans were duly repaid.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to buy two bags of sugar, one box of vanilla sugar, 35 kg of ginger and one 50-kg bag of dah (a species of hibiscus used in infusions).

Phuldei is one of them, the lady sitting third from right in the photo raising her hand. Phuldei is 32 and is a very poor; she lives with her husband one son and two daughters aged 13 & 10 years. Her family belongs to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. Her children are continuing schooling in the village school. \n\nPhuldei has been running a spice items selling business with items like onion, garlic, chili, cumin seeds, coriander, etc. for the last 10 years. Her husband goes to five weekly markets of her locality in a week with bulk of items on a bike and sells in the market. Apart from this she has also a tent house business in her house. Her monthly income from the existing business is 8000 rupees. \n\nOut of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and spent some income for the education of her children. She wants to increase stock levels of her business. So the loan will be utilized to purchase more of the items she sells in bulk to keep the stock up for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently and she can add a substantial income to her present income. \n\nPhuldei hopes to increase the stock  to run her business smoothly with sufficient items and provide a better education to her children. The other five members of the group are Reema, Ramani, Chandrakala, Aniali and Nilendri who are running cloth and grocery shop businesses. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1194632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy onion, garlic, coriander, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kusurla,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aniali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phuldei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":184000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T21:32:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":474702,"name":"Gafua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gafua is 36 years old and married, with five children.

was born in 1992. She lives in Bac Ninh, the smallest province in Vietnam. She is majoring in human resources management at the University of Labour and Social Affairs (www.ulsa.edu.vn). Her course lasts four years and she will graduate in 2014. Hang is the first person in her family to have graduated from high school and to have a higher education. \n\nHer parents sell personal and household goods to earn a living. Her family\u2019s income is about 10,000,000 VND. Her mother, Huong, sits next beside her in this picture, is also a member of SEDA\u2019s credit program. Hang's family is her motivation and her support in choosing her major. She wants to earn a lot of money so she can support her family, improve her family\u2019s living standards and also pay for her brother\u2019s education fees. \n\nHang plans to work in the capital of Hanoi or the province of Bac Ninh within the next five to 10 years. She understands that studying helps her to have the opportunity to get a high-paid job and to fulfill her dream of becoming a human resources manager. Hang wants to borrow 10,206,000 VND to pay for her university fees, books and studying tools. This loan suits her family\u2019s situation and income. \n\nThe paperwork from SEDA has been fast and convenient to meet her needs. Besides lacking money for her education costs, Hang has other difficulties such as her living costs and transportation costs. Through this program, she wants to tell people that Vietnam is a developing country: they have an amazing youth generation but they are still poor and need your help to give them opportunities to develop their future.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNeriza dreams of giving her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He aims to earn a greater income so he can uplift his family's living condition out of poverty and educate his two children. For now, he struggles because of inadequate capital due to an increase of household expenses and rentals for his stalls. With regard to his situation, he requested a loan of PHP 18,000, which allows him to buy more fresh coconut.

She has been in the business of making fabric with her husband for the past eight years. When she started this business, her income was very low but with the passage of time her business income increased, which is only due to her passion to give a better future to her kids. She is illiterate, so she wants to see her children well educated. \r\n\r\nShe has two machines.

She is married and a mother of five children. She is currently in her first loan cycle and has borrowed PKR 13000 from Kashf Foundation for the purchase of another sewing machine for her daughter to assist her in completing the orders of her customers.

She lives with Hilario who provides transportation services.  They have a daughter, Lily, who is 30-years-old.  They live together comfortably in their own house with their two grandchildren they love very much.\r\n\r\nTezalia\u2019s activity is providing mototaxi passenger transportation services.  She bought the mototaxi with her savings and a private loan.  At the beginning, they leased it out but seeing how it became worn down quickly due to the poor handling it got she and her spouse decided it would be better if he drove it himself and provided the services.  She started out three years ago with the purchase of her first vehicle and in time she\u2019s refurbished other units that would become worn down through daily usage.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it generates income to cover family expenses.  She started this activity because she needed to have a source of income because she had been unable to secure employment; now she feels more secure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she comments that she doesn\u2019t like it when her mototaxi breaks down often because this causes her unplanned expenses but even so she gets good results that are reflected in her profits.  She plans to make progress and to be able to buy more mototaxis and expand her fleet of vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis is her 5th MFP loan.  She\u2019s very happy with the financial support she\u2019s getting because she\u2019ll feel more confident this way of moving forward with her work.  On the other hand, she commits to continue making her payments punctually as scheduled.  She\u2019s very happy to be part of her communal bank because they are all very responsible and supportive.  She will use the requested 300 new soles to reupholster her mototaxi\u2019s seats to provide greater comfort for the passengers who access her service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1211260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to reupholster the seats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tezalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":46.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447713},{"amount":18.89,"local_amount":45.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":49.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053614},{"amount":20.6,"local_amount":49.43,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":53.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188551},{"amount":21.36,"local_amount":51.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572465},{"amount":21.73,"local_amount":52.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":56.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122127},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":59.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867963}],"funded_date":"2012-10-11T18:49:03Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":480771,"name":"Injieh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Injieh is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.

She lost her job after the breakup of the Soviet Union and, in search of a source of income for her family, became involved in sales of sewn goods, having started this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Talchakan's hard work and persistence, the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS).  Despite the business losses during the unrest of 2010, she was able to survive and develop her business.  In order to further develop her business, Talchakan requested a loan in the amount of 85,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand the merchandise selection by buying winter clothing.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business by increasing goods turnover and wants to help her sister to hold her son's wedding in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1214053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to expand the merchandise selection by buying winter clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Birleshken village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Talchakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":85000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6047},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6218},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6394},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6575},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6762},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6953},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7150},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7353},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7561},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7775},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7996},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8216}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.83,"local_amount":6047,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-28T09:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6113.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315330000},{"amount":133.51,"local_amount":6218,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6286.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938782},{"amount":137.28,"local_amount":6394,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6464.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071263},{"amount":141.17,"local_amount":6575,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6647.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459685},{"amount":145.18,"local_amount":6762,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6836.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012450},{"amount":149.29,"local_amount":6953,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7029.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754811},{"amount":153.51,"local_amount":7150,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7229.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458816},{"amount":835.23,"local_amount":38901,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-26T08:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":39331.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862949}],"funded_date":"2012-10-27T15:52:31Z","paid_date":"2013-06-26T08:50:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":480772,"name":"Yvonne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yvonne is 42 years old.

Having started the business with a sum of 25,000 som, Dilbara was able to lease a cafe space for 32 seats and a tandoor (clay oven for making bakery products) for making sams (national meat pies).  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, the monthly profit from the business now amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Dilbara requested a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase equipment - a refrigerator and a cafe display.

He has operated a cheese- and cream-processing business for 4 years.  He learned the business from a woman who had operated a similar business for 14 years.  She taught him to make a dairy-based product called quesillo, a key ingredient for making pupusas.  He saw that her business was profitable and decided to apply for a loan to start his own business.  For now, he sells everything he makes to a wholesaler.  \r\n\r\nJose leaves in his truck at 5:30 a.m. each morning to collect milk from the people he buys from.

To provide an income for her family, she is involved in selling food products.  Thanks to Mubarak's hard work, the monthly income from the business yields about 15,000 som (KGS), which serves as the base for covering the family's expenses for food and basic needs.  Considering the special friendliness of the owner and a good selection of products, Mubarak has a large number of customers visiting her store, which required the involvement of the entire family in the business.  Today, Mubarak's son and daughter-in-law help her at the store, and her husband also provides feasible assistance.  In order to further develop her business, Mubarak requested a loan in the amount of 115,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a car for timely transportation of products to the store.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her business in order to build a big house for her family in the

He would like to invest in the purchase of new tools and equipment to process the metal pieces for his art. He has been selling through NOVICA since 2007. This is his story:\n\n\"I'm a self-taught and impassioned artist; I was only a 13-year-old child when I began to make my own toys. I used to tear apart other toys and use their components to create my own versions. That's how I got into making sculptures, but this time by recycling mechanical parts. One day, when I was working on the sculpture of a medieval knight, I was missing some pieces so I went to a friend's auto-shop. He said I could take anything I needed from a metal box he had lying around. Three days later my friend came by and asked about some pieces he needed, which he had left outside the box. Needless to say, I had taken them, but they were already welded into the sculpture. I had to go with my friend to meet the owner of the truck for which those parts were originally intended, and explain to him they were now part of a sculpture. Rather than getting angry he was fascinated and bought it! He christened the sculpture, 'The Son of the Mercedes,' because those parts were intended for a Mercedes Benz.\"\n\n\"I would like to thank you for your continued support of my art. With this microcredit, I'll be able to continue developing my original sculptures.\"\n\nUse the link below to view Miguel's recycled metal sculptures on the NOVICA site:\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/artistdetail\/index.cfm?faid=6243"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1198573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in the purchase of new tools and equipment to process metal pieces for his sculptures","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.75,"local_amount":15.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323082732},{"amount":35.1,"local_amount":35.1,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-11T12:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":35.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332034633},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-07T10:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340259542},{"amount":34.8,"local_amount":34.8,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":34.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154344},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":44.5,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":44.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381796048},{"amount":46.5,"local_amount":46.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":46.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390869505},{"amount":192.35,"local_amount":192.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":192.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399904761}],"funded_date":"2012-10-11T22:42:52Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T16:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":8,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":481884,"name":"Luis Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis trabaj\u00f3 durante muchos a\u00f1os en una f\u00e1brica de calzado, pero el due\u00f1o traslad\u00f3 la empresa para otra ciudad y as\u00ed se qued\u00f3 sin empleo.

He would like to stock up on the natural fibers he uses to weave, and also to help with workshop costs.\r\n\r\nNengah has been selling through NOVICA since 2003. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My mother is a senior 'ate' grass weaver in our village. My grandfather taught me to print Balinese handwriting on palm leaves as well as to carve images on this leaf. When demand grew for 'ate' products, I saw it as a challenge to learn how to make these too. Weaving this durable island grass is not as hard as people may think, but it's not easy work either.

To supplement the income, he also works for others in the local area for a fee. His daily income is approximately 20,000 KHR and he manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after deducting daily expenses. The scarcity of working capital is the main challenge for his rice-paddy.\r\n\r\nSern has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles while the other member has been with VisionFund for three cycles. The past loans, which were fully paid back, have relieved his family\u2019s burden and improved their livelihood. Now he and his group member are applying for a new loan of 1,500,000 KHR and 4,000,000 KHR respectively. As the leader, Sern will use his portion to buy fertilizer for his rice and cassava cultivated land and use a portion of it to spend on labor costs. He hopes this loan will enable his crop yield to become more profitable so as to sell it for a good price and fulfill his dream to expand his plantation business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1210283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for his rice and cassava cultivated land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T22:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T22:20:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sern","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":5500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5542622.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197480}],"funded_date":"2012-10-21T01:32:07Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":482252,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz Marina toda su vida ha tenido que atravesar por grandes adversidades para poder sacar sus hijos y su propio hogar adelante, sin embargo siempre se ha caracterizado por ser muy luchadora y buscar salir adelante con mucho esfuerzo.
