She is single but is the mother of two small children who she is raising with a great deal of love. She lives with her children in her parents' house, the same place where she strives every day to give the best of herself in order to get ahead. Diana's work is selling candies. Her stand is located in her parents' house, which stays very busy with her customers because it is very well situated in her neighborhood. Diana is very well known for her good humor and charisma, and her sales bring in the income she needs. At times, she works in the streets of the city or at festivals or special events where there is a great influx of people.\r\n\r\nDiana was motivated to develop this business by her need to be independent and by the daily expenses she needed to cover for her family. She has now been in this line of work for four years. She felt very nervous at the beginning, but with time she was able to develop her best qualities and now she sells a great deal and is very happy about it. What she most enjoys about her job is talking to her customers and making them laugh. She considers the most difficult part to be selling under the hot morning sun.

In addition, the family owns a greenhouse, where different kind of vegetables and greens are grown. They do all relevant agricultural works to ensure a good harvest. The harvested production is sold locally.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to purchase food for cattle. With this credit, she will purchase hay, which will be used to feed the cow during the fall and winter seasons. Since the cow will be fed properly in winter, Anastasia will be able to receive a planned amount of milk and produce dairy products. This will increase the income of the family.

She is a single mother with a 14-year-old son who depends on her for his food and  education. Melita works hard every day to be able to give him a better quality of life. She lives in her own house, together with her siblings and father. Melita works primarily transporting passengers on her motorcycle. She gets up very early to drive her mototaxi through the city streets in search of people who need transportation from one place to another. She has dedicated herself to this work for 16 years, which has allowed her to pay to feed her son and send him to school, as well as advance financially. Melita also has a car wash installed in her house and she complements this with the sale of different lubricants, motor accessories, and motortaxis.\r\n\r\nFortunately, her financial earnings keep growing, giving her the peace of mind she needs in order to continue working day after day. She works with the help of her brother and her father. What she likes about her job is that she can organize her time in her own way. She does not have a fixed work schedule, so, in this way, she can devote herself to all of her activities and ensure they run smoothly. So far, everything is going well for Melita and she hopes to continue that way until she must take on other responsibilities. \r\n\r\nThis is Melita's eleventh loan, so she thanks everyone who helps make it possible for her to access this financing. With it, she she will feel safer about advancing her business. On the other hand, she promises to punctually make all of her payments and, in this way, be assured and supported by the other members of her communal bank. Melita requests a total of 1500 soles that she will use to refurbish some parts of her car wash, to make some repairs to her motortaxi, and to buy some lubricants and oils to sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1213435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She lives with her husband, Edinson, and their two children who are 16- and 12-years old, respectively.  The family share their house with Monica's parents.  Monica has operated a clothing sales business for 20 years.  She sells a range of clothing pieces of various styles and sizes, for all ages and for men as well as women.  She also sells footwear.  She reviews and adjusts her inventory once a month, depending on what she expects to sell.  She counts on a relative, who lives in the town from which she receives her merchandise, to order whatever she needs for the business.  Two years ago, she added beauty products--creams, perfumes, face powder, etc.--to the range of merchandise that she sells.  She works alone and says that she is pleased with her progress.  The business suits her because she is friendly and charismatic, with an easy manner that makes it easy for her to attract new customers.  The business is profitable and she can organize her time so that she can both work and take care of her family without neglecting either.   For the future, she would like to open a shop of her own.  This will be Monica's 14th MFP loan and she says that she is grateful that this means of borrowing is accessible for businesses like hers.  She says, too, that she is committed to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time and that the trust she's gained from the other members of her community bank is important to her.  Monica will use this loan (S\/.1000) to stock her business with clothes, shoes and accessories.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1213439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to stock her clothing sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":178.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":184.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":144.88,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447721},{"amount":63.92,"local_amount":159.8,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053624},{"amount":66.31,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":172.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188561},{"amount":66.76,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572475},{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":178.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":185.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122137},{"amount":73.8,"local_amount":184.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":191.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867973}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T09:21:07Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":481112,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi is a married woman and the mother of five children.

All her merchandise is sent in bulk from another city. Every day, she goes around looking for customers throughout the city, she sells house by house, either in cash or on credit. She collects the money daily, weekly or fortnightly. She has been doing this for three years and sometimes she gets her spouse's support, who has a vehicle and helps her transporting the merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe feels very satisfied because she is doing very well in this first stage. She loves this job because it leaves her enough time when she is not working in order to take care of the household chores in a comfortable way. Besides, she has earned her customers' respect and confidence, through a good treatment and through her big smile. She makes good sales and as a result she obtains good profits. She hopes to keep growing and later on to get an establishment where she can display her products more calmly.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan with MFP.

These businesses enable her to earn approximately 19,000 KHR per day but, after deducting daily expenses, she can save only around 6,000KHR. \r\n\r\nThis will be Saem\u2019s fifth time requesting a loan via VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The previous loans have helped her to sustain her crop and household. Now Saem is leading a group member named Rim, who has only been with VisionFund for one loan cycle, to request a loan in the amount of 1,350,000 KHR in total. Saem plans on using her requested loan portion, which is 1,100,000KHR, to buy fertilizers so that she can smoothly support her rice field and to buy building materials to fix her house. After wisely using her loan portion, she believes that her businesses will provide good outcome so that she can gain more profit to better support the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1211052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and materials to fix her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1350000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":523565.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118955},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":209426.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641413},{"amount":77.78,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":314139.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197486},{"amount":12.96,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52356.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837931},{"amount":49.26,"local_amount":190000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":198955.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696081},{"amount":28.52,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":115184.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942241}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T22:30:02Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":482781,"name":"Olivia","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Casada e m\u00e3e de 4 filhos, 3 ainda frequentam Escola no n\u00edvel Secund\u00e1rio, vive na casa pr\u00f3pria com a sua fam\u00edlia e n\u00e3o sustenta mais ningu\u00e9m.\n\u00c9 comerciante e dona do seu pr\u00f3prio neg\u00f3cio de venda de produtos diversos.

Having been in this occupation for five years, they are able to earn almost 30,000 KHR per day and manage to save about 20,000 KHR each day after deducting daily expenses. Insufficient working capital to support the paddy-field is still the main challenge.\r\n\r\nReam has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles and fully paid back the past loans. She has wisely used the previous loans to better support her family's living conditions. She is asking for another loan with VisionFund of 1,600,000 KHR. She is going to utilize her portion to buy rice seeds and fertilizers for her farmland. With this loan, she hopes to cultivate her rice to earn more income to improve her lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1211093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice seeds and fertilizers for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T14:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ream","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533300},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533300},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":533300,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":538491.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641415},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":1066700,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1077083.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941247}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T15:04:58Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":481155,"name":"Annabelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annabelle is 33 years old and from the community of San Miguel, Bohol.

Esto despert\u00f3 en m\u00ed el deseo de conocer la manera c\u00f3mo crecen, se desarrollan y sobre todo la forma como inciden en ellos las din\u00e1micas familiares, sociales y culturales. Por consiguiente, decid\u00ed estudiar psicolog\u00eda.

She had an excellent academic record at the university and received a stipend that covered the cost of her tuition there.  The stipend was a big help for her family, who operate a clothing sales business, as well as for her.\r\n\r\nAngelica now wants to study for a masters degree at the L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes in France.  She is applying to Kiva lenders for a loan that she will use to cover the costs of translating and processing official documents, related travel expenses, and tuition fees.  \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nI knew from the time that I was seven years old that I wanted to work with children.  We were living in Venezuela then and my mother was caring for children there.  I wanted to understand how children developed and, above all, the way that family, social and cultural dynamics shape children.  That urge I felt led me to study psychology, but I had to wait five years before I could start at the university because I had to work and pull enough money together to pay the related costs.  Once there, I was able to make sense of the many questions that I had and work through the complexities they entailed.\r\n\r\nAfter two year as a psychologist at an institution for the protection of children whose rights had been violated, I knew that I wanted to learn more.  I was struck by the many, many ways that the rights of children are violated and threatened.  Specifically, I wanted to understand--to put it in the context of my planned masters thesis--the process for arresting children and the ways that the process relates to violations and threats to children's rights.\r\n\r\nThis urge, then, awakened first in my childhood and still strong through my years at the university, has become a social imperative for children's rights and well-being.  An imperative that requires a joint effort and the advancement of the work to which I have dedicated myself.  I hope Kiva lenders will join the cause because your support represents the engine that will drive us to the goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1213385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study for a career as an advocate for children's rights.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1034000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1034000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1034127.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042089}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T16:24:44Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":483407,"name":"Tuyana","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u0443\u044f\u043d\u0430 - \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0415\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439: \u043d\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0447\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0442\u044b, \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0442, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0442. \u0422\u0443\u044f\u043d\u0430 - \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b.","en":"Tuyana is an entrepreneur from Berdyansk.

eight schools in Rockwall, Texas. The center is owned by Coach Barrett who has raced for 29 consecutive years in 43 states and 6 countries. He\u2019s trained more than 30 All-American athletes, and over the past eight years, helped the Rockwall community achieve what it thought were unachievable goals. \r\n\r\nOne of those community members is Jim, who, along with several RRC members, helped Coach Barrett publish a book titled \u201cRRC Baker\u2019s Dozen (plus two) take on the NYC Marathon.\u201d Jim wrote: \u201cI\u2019m a runner and I\u2019m so glad that God used runners like Lee Chatham, Coach Barrett, Sonya Johnson and others to encourage me to join them on these group runs. It\u2019s helped me learn firsthand about runners who go the extra mile to train\u2026. But it has also allowed me the opportunity to see a group united in their care and concern for their fellow runners\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nCoach Barrett\u2019s training began in the 1980s when he was in college helping high school athletes, and by 1996, his work snowballed into a training club, which eventually expanded into a business. Coach Barrett, originally from North Carolina, participated there in organizing several community group runs. He moved to Rockwall eight years ago for work and started the first of now 10 daily running groups. Coach Barrett said he wanted to bring runners to one place and gain identity with the community--or as he calls it \u201caction with passion.\u201d He began a separate running team to run marathons nationwide, which expanded from three to 300 members.\r\n\r\nCoach Barrett is also the Southwestern region\u2019s association member of the Masters, Men\u2019s, and Women\u2019s Long Distance Running Committees of the USA Track & Field, the national governing body for track and field in the U.S. He said RRC offers training to get people off their couches and running a 5K, or 3.1 miles.\r\n\r\nHis Accion Texas Inc. loan will help his business be competitive, he said, as he\u2019ll use it to purchase nutritional snacks, first aid items and name-brand running shoes to sell at the center\u2019s store. Other major businesses already have a large inventory to offer their clients. As a small entity, Coach Barrett could not compete; the loan gave him an opportunity to build a better inventory for his clients, he said. The loan helped sustain eight RRC jobs, as well.  Without Accion\u2019s help, Coach Barrett said, \u201cWe would have to close shop.\u201d\r\n\r\nContinuing to stay community-focused, Coach Barrett said RRC already has booked 20 events between January and June 2013. He expects that number to increase.

She has one additional dependent, a friend's daughter who lives with her for a better education.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Mary H. established her beauty salon business. She began her business because she was given away in an early marriage, as her supposed husband was a wealthy businessman. Her parents saw it as a means of survival for her to get married to him. When she got married, her aunt advised her to learn the hairdressing trade, which she did, and now she owns a shop. \r\n\r\nWorking 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 541,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Mary H. requires a loan in order to purchase hair attachments: <ul><li>Charming Hair - 2 dozen @ 360,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Expression Braiding Hair - 10 dozen @ 150,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Afro Kinking - 2 dozen @ 260,000 SLL<\/li>\r\n<li>Hair Glue - 4 dozen @ 60,000 SLL<\/li><\/ul> The balance, 20,000 SLL, will be used for her transportation costs.

They have three children. \r\n\r\nNext year, he plans to use his assets to start construction on his home and to complete two more rooms. As his children grow, three rooms is too small for the family. But a lot of money would be needed to start construction. He plans to use the loan to buy another couple of cows and, when they grow up, to sell them at the best price.

Hernando in his efforts to expand his Miami-based marketing company, \"Sphere Marketing and Advertising Inc.\" Hernando is originally from Colombia and came to the United States five years ago looking for a better future for his family. He is proud to be the owner of the company he started to work with when he arrived in the United States. He was able to consolidate a company that understands clients' needs to know how to sell and market a new or existing product. Hernando's biggest challenge was surviving the financial crisis when most of his clients reduced their budgets for TV and radio commercials. Hernando is fully dedicated to expanding his work and has found a niche in providing specialized services to distributors of natural products, which base most of their sales on advertising. Hernando\u2019s company designs marketing campaigns for this type of client. He offers a full package of radio \/ TV \/ graphic advertising. For infomercials, he buys \"air space\" on Spanish TV channels. He still does not have the working capital and equipment to produce an infomercial, so he hires an independent contractor when needed. Costs for TV space and video productions are very high, so Hernando is looking for a loan that he can use to buy TV air time in advance, which would increase his profitability and strengthen his position to negotiate better prices with local and national channels. This loan will help him expand his service and at the same time generate more jobs.

He's a responsible and honest person with a great desire for self-improvement.  Many years ago he started his business selling electrical appliances, sodas, and juice.  His biggest inventory product, though, or the one that has most turnover, is toys.\n\nJos\u00e9's work day starts at 8 in the morning when he arrives at his business, located in one of the markets in Managua.  The first thing he does is clean his products so the toys he sells will always be presentable and in good condition.  This gives the impression that they're fresh and recently purchased, even though it might be something he bought days ago, because he buys and stores merchandise.  He ends his day at 6 in the afternoon.\n\nHis best seasons are between Christmas and January and February.  He begins to sell products from November and December.  In January Nicaragua celebrates the Three Kings, a tradition when children receive toys.  Jos\u00e9 also takes advantage of these celebrations because it's when he sells most.  And in February classes begin and he has a variety of products such as backpacks for students.\n\nHe's requesting this loan to buy toys, trucks, a tea set, a robot, Transformers, dolls, and cars to sell during the Christmas season.\n\nHe's grateful to CEPRODEL and Kiva for their support because this loan will help to supply his business and buy and stock products to satisfy customer demand.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1210048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy toys for the Christmas season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 De La Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1630.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1820.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1862.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1920.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2030.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2120.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2172.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2309.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2380.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2459.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":481294,"name":"Arlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlinda is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a business making and selling candles in the Philippines.

He began his business because his father was a farmer, and going to school was not an option as the farm needed his help.  He worked through his teenage years in the village with his family, and then decided to join a friend in Makeni Town in his second-hand business.  <p>\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, Ibrahim II earns about Le 875,000 every month, usually selling his goods to peddlers and passersby. Shortage of supplies is his major problem.

Working seven days a week and seven hours a day, she earns about Le 827,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Haja requires the loan in order to stock her business. She will purchase Bio-Clear Cream (three cartons at Le 230,000); Razac Cream (four dozen at Le 180,000); Vaseline (four bundles at Le 100,000); Doctor Clear Cream (one carton at Le 190,000) and Pure Black Spray (ten dozen at Le 100,000). \r\n\r\nIn the future, Haja plans to further her studies and set up a well-established business to support her family. The loan will help greatly. Competition is her major challenge.  She is very competitive and hardworking. To generate business effectively she needs enough capital, so she is grateful for this loan.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1208905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase Bio-Clear Cream, Razac Cream, Vaseline, Doctor Clear Cream and Pure Black Spray to stock her cosmetics business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T19:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T19:40:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315576008},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322937772},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070258},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339458640},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347011347},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":507997.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355753631}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T18:03:04Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":481967,"name":"Maria Marcos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Marcos vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus hijos, ella se dedica a la venta de pupusas desde hace ya varios a\u00f1os se ha hecho de mucha experiencia y eso le ayuda a obtener siempre las mejores ganancias, su negocio esta ubicado en el lugar de su residencia en una comunidad muy concurrida de personas, se ha hecho de mucha clientela pues las personas la prefieren por sus exquisitas pupusas, por la calidad, los buenos precios y sobre todo por el servicio inigualable siempre al servicio de los clientes; Mar\u00eda es una mujer ejemplar, dedicada a su labor le gusta luchar por lo que desea, todos los d\u00edas se esfuerza al m\u00e1ximo por ganarse un futuro mejor y no piensa rendirse hasta alcanzar el \u00e9xito, como toda buena comerciante quiere acrecentar el negocio pero no posee de suficiente capital que lo respalde por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le  permita comprar ma\u00edz, frijol, quesillo, chicharr\u00f3n, etc. Mar\u00eda Marcos tiene buenas referencias de pago y una moral intachable, asegura que podr\u00e1 cancelar la deuda y a la vez tiene la esperanza que le dar\u00e1 a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Mar\u00eda Marcos lives with her life partner and their children.

She started the business to help her husband, who is a driver, in running the home and to be self-reliant. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,992,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Salamatu has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to add to her stock and expand. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 318,720.

This machine and investment have expanded the scope of services she offers to her customers.\r\n\r\nAda's desires to provide for her family and get ahead have lead her to open her own small business, and her older children help her run the tortilla operation. Ada is requesting this loan in hopes of broadening the scope of her business. She plans to use the support from this loan to purchase meat and corn for sale by the pound. She hopes this investment will help her improve her family\u2019s quality of life, as well as to make improvements to her home\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1213692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase meat and corn to sell by the pound.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":58.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":58.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048942},{"amount":61.17,"local_amount":61.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":61.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006095},{"amount":60.68,"local_amount":60.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":60.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568871},{"amount":61.59,"local_amount":61.59,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118489},{"amount":62.73,"local_amount":62.73,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531114},{"amount":395.5,"local_amount":395.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":395.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573058}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T18:56:02Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":481356,"name":"Rek's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rek, 34 years old, is married and blessed with four children.

She aspires to open a big restaurant in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1211675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking utensils and food like flour, sugar, cereal, cooking oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"malindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-3.216667 40.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-10-13T00:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-12T00:40:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shufaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":21050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":957},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":953}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":1914,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1928.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315659414},{"amount":56.83,"local_amount":4785,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4821.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323056165},{"amount":34.1,"local_amount":2871,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2893.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331191352},{"amount":56.83,"local_amount":4785,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4821.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339577675},{"amount":45.46,"local_amount":3828,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3857.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347125281},{"amount":34.05,"local_amount":2867,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355871327}],"funded_date":"2012-10-13T23:46:05Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:40:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":481373,"name":"Simei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simei is a 50-year-old married man with eight children living in Kasese, Uganda.
