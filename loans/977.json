As the main source of income, Nadejda has been raising livestock and growing crops since 1996, having started her business with a sum of 20,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Nadejda's herd currently includes 2 dairy cows with offspring, 22 goats and sheep, and 1 pig. Nadejda also works 4 hectares of land with potatoes and grains. Monthly income from her business amounts to roughly 10,000 som.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Nadejda has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som to purchase livestock for fattening and resale, and to stock up on animal fodder for the winter. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her herd so that in time she can build a large house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1216097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Orlinoe village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-13T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-12T08:10:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadejda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30026.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458817},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20017.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776894},{"amount":505.03,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25022.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.22,"payment_id":459019309},{"amount":529.47,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25022.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":490749284}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T03:48:19Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":481524,"name":"Roeurn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roeurn , aged 49 and married, is a rural villager from Battambang province's Moung Russey district.

She is married to Agustin and a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nFlora maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer's prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlora hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

The profits from her loan will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and provide for the educational expenses of her children. Flora looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. In the future, she dreams that her business will continue to grow. Flora wants her children to finish their studies and be able to have a comfortable life someday. She never fails to attend the fellowship* every week, as it helps her to be stronger and closer to God with all the Bible studies being conducted. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She has been selling jewellery and clothes for the last two years. She says that she works at her home, but that she sometimes goes out to pander her wares from door to door. She works Mondays to Sundays and her working hours vary according to her availability. She buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago, from various distributors and importers that sell at a low price, which is advantageous for her. WIth this loan, Silvia will buy jewellery, trousers, tights, and underwear to sell. One of Silvia's goals is to remain in business, to grow each day and have enough stock to keep her customers happy and satisfied with their purchase. She lives with her husband, her 27-year-old son and two grandsons, who are 20 and 11 years old and whom she provides for. Silvia's professional dreams are to keep her business and her customers. Her personal dreams are to stay healthy so as to keep making money and improve her family's quality of life. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, since the loan will allow her to invest in her business. She says that the communal bank she belongs to has great communication between the members. Furthermore, the training dispensed there was very useful to her, as she was able to learn new sale strategies as well as accounting techniques. Curic\u00f3 is located in the Maule region, at the heart of the country. The city boasts a Mediterranean climate, considered one of the balmiest in the country. Its main cultural attraction is wine; its main natural one, the wonderful surroundings. Despite the recent increase in the workforce, the region still is, according to the last census, one of the poorest in the

He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. Dante hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving his family a good life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She currently weaves macram\u00e9, a trade she learned from friends who taught her the techniques. She later started her own business. \r\n \r\nYolanda will use this loan to start another business, buying machines for butcher shops. She will purchase the machines from dealers in the city of El Alto and set them up in her home. This business will let her generate the most resources to support her family; she is married and has two children. When asked what she liked most about Pro Mujer, she said she liked the training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1214530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy machines for butcher shops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-10-13T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-12T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia Julia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ursula Alicia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Daysi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13636.35,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2272.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2272.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":329.18,"local_amount":2272.82,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490646},{"amount":329.18,"local_amount":2272.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095518},{"amount":329.18,"local_amount":2272.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235593},{"amount":329.18,"local_amount":2272.82,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617426},{"amount":329.18,"local_amount":2272.82,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172020},{"amount":329.1,"local_amount":2272.25,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914239}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T01:44:17Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:19:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":481691,"name":"Pheap's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pheap lives with her spouse in the village of the Moung Russey district of Battambang province.

To make a living, she has been working as a paid construction worker in a local area while her brother helps the family to earn extra income by working as a motor-taxi driver in the local area. The current business earns her family 40,000 KHR per day and allow them to save 20,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n \r\nVuthdy\u2019s group consists of two members who have been with VisionFund for four cycles. The previous loans, which she completely paid back, have supported her business and improved her family\u2019s burden. Now she is leading her group to ask for a loan of 1,400,000 KHR each. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy a proper motorbike for her brother\u2019s transportation service because the old motor was seriously broken. Vuthdy hopes this loan will enable her brother to have a decent motor so their income will increase and they will improve their standard of living through providing a transportation service."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1212381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy a proper motorbike for her brother\u2019s transportation service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-13T21:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-12T21:20:11Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vuthdy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saroen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":233400},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":232600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315519375},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118974},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331266084},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641445},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197508},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941277},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841536},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046777},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":233400,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":235561.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837956},{"amount":174.85,"local_amount":699400,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":705877.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696099}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T22:02:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:13:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":481704,"name":"Akil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akil is from Iraq.

The group is composed of 9 members and is directed by a board of which Fania is the treasurer. The businesses that the group members run are varied and include: a mason's business, making blankets from vicu\u00f1a wool and threads, a butcher's, making baby sweaters, knitting sweaters, selling vegetables, making alpaca leggings, and making traditional skirts. \r\nThe loan that they are requesting will benefit the group of micro-entrepreneurs of which Fania is a member. She says that this is the first time that she has been a member of Pro Mujer and she joined on the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution. She currently has a business knitting sweaters for babies.

Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nNanneh runs a garie business (a cassava grain product) at Kandeh town; she sells gari by bag and by packet.  She has been running this business for over 15 years. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 6 days per week.  She is married to an old man; her husband and children help her to prepare the cassava product. Nanneh faces a lot of completion in the business, but she still has many customers.\r\n\r\nNanneh has requested a loan to buy more bags of garie and also to buy other business items to add to the business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and educate her children. In the future, she would like to open a garie industry. \r\n\r\nShe thanks you for your

Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nTiangay runs a food stand business; she sells rice, garie and flour. She has been running this business for 6 years. She works at the business every day, even when she goes home, she will sell to the customer. She also receives income from her elder brother and sister because life is very difficult for her.   Tiangay says that the main challenge to her business is the means of finance to support her business.\r\n\r\nTiangay has requested a loan of 800,000 SLL in order to buy a variety of food stock like rice, garie, and flour. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her business. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a higher level.

She is married with 2 children between the ages of 10 years and 16 years. Both of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mariama established her clothing business. She began her business because she wanted to improve the lives of her family and change her status. She works at the business 9 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nMariama requires a loan in order to buy more wax cotton and different kinds of clothing material. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and educate her children. In the future, Mariam plans to expand her business to the shop level.

They have twin sons who are 13 years old.  Through great effort, they were able to build a house made of solid materials.  Erlinda is always dedicated to her family, so she chose to open a small business in her home.  Since then, she has managed her grocery store.  For more than 14 years, she has worked as a merchant.  However, her business has suffered as a result of the increased prices being charged by her suppliers.  Erlinda is always determined to continue her family business despite all of the challenges because this is the only way for her to educate and feed her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo overcome these challenges, Erlinda wants to buy products in bulk (preferably nonperishable goods) so that she can continue her business and generate more income.  In addition, she does not rule out the possibility of expanding her business by offering more products at lower prices.  She feels that the loan will help her accomplish these goals.  As of this date, Erlinda has received six loans from MFP.  She always tries to complete her payments on time and has maintained a good credit history.

She has as a goal to get further ahead and increase her earnings to remodel her house, because for her, having a place that is safe and good to live is very important. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1215077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a greater number of products to sell, like perfumes, creams, makeup and jewelry. \r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-14T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-13T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nayibe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87807},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89856},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91952},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94098},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96294},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98540},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100840},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103193},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":105601},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108065},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110586},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":113168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":483453,"name":"Angelita Porfiria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angelita tiene 61 a\u00f1os de edad de estado civil casada tiene 1 hijo de 10 a\u00f1os .Compro una vitrina y perchas de all\u00ed ella vende laminas, cuadernos hasta art\u00edculos de bazar y pocos v\u00edveres.

She is going to invest the loan in buying beer, because now she has to buy from intermediaries and the product becomes more expensive. She wants to be able to buy direct in larger quantities to lower her expenses. Also, she wants to buy a cooler to store the beer. She hopes that this loan will help her to increase her revenue and products in the store; she has two sons who are 13 and 14 years of age and one 12-year-old daughter, and she wants to make more money so that they can continue with their studies.

She previously accessed a 12,000 PHP loan that she used to buy additional stock of liquor and other beverages. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and for her personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of liquor and other beverages. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nVioleta hopes her business will expand through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.
