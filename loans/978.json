Yevgeniya needs to take an additional loan of 4000 griven to purchase a batch of office supplies, specifically notebooks, textbook and other goods for students. Despite the seasonal downturn in most sales, school supplies sell rapidly in the fall and Yevgeniya is hoping to increase her profits again with this

He has five children, two of whom are dependent on him and still in school. To make a living, he has been farming rice for 33 years and working as a construction worker in the local area, while his wife is a homemaker and also raises cows. Saroen can earn approximately 30,000 KHR per day and manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses.

Currently she has a business selling potatoes, that she has worked in for some years, and that she launched through her own initiative.\r\n \r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her working capital, by buying potatoes that she will buy from the wholesalers and subsequently sell at her stand. This form of work allows her to generate income for supporting her family as much as she can, as she is single and has five children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health clinic.

He has a tailoring business with his brother.  His brother does the cutting, and Darwin is the one who does the sewing.  His workshop is located in the Sewenkani neighborhood.  This is his first loan with the institution.  Darwin will use this loan to buy a sewing machine for his business, because this is the season when the demand for his products grows.  The reason that he is requesting this loan is that he lacks cash, and because his brother, who is a client of the institution, recommended the institution to him because of the warmth and speed with which he has been treated.   Darwin faces challenges in his business, such as the competition in the marketplace, because there are a lot of people who work making garments.  He will use the profits that he gets to continue to equip his workshop, buying another sewing machine called a \"collareta,\" because it is specialized for use in sewing collars. \r\n\r\nDarwin wants to succeed and eventually have his own workshop and his own machines and customers, leaving his brother to also work on his own.

has a small store in her home that allows her to continue to support her family. As a secondary activity, she sells firewood. Her desire is to provide her children with an education, since they are older and one is about to start her basic education. Because of this, Marta needs a bit more money since her husband's income is not sufficient for their costs. For this reason, she is requesting a loan to stock her store with basic food staples, and to buy more firewood; buying wholesale is cheaper and her earnings will be higher.

It was diffiicult for him to get ahead and acquire his own home, but with the joint effort of him, his children and his wife, they were all able to build some rooms and live more comfortably.

Saltanat has more than 4 years of experience in this field, which makes her an experienced and skilled person in this field. \r\n\r\nSaltanat usually sells her crop in the central bazaar. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy, and many national dishes are made with vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and are also used to make fresh punch. Saltanat's monthly income is 90 AZN.

He is an Internally Displaced Person and lives with his parents in Bilasuavr IDP Settlement. He is a farmer and has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the past eight years.  Murvet was unemployed and did not have an education degree. When he got married, he needed financial sources to support his new family, so he started his business.\r\n \r\nDuring long years of experience, Murvet gained enough skills and experience to run the business, thanks to his father`s experience, too. He chose these crops because they are profitable, and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. He usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is AZN 70.\r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy; many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma.

is a 47-year-old man on pension who is married with four children. He is IDP and lives with his family in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He breeds cows and cattle and sells milk and milk products, as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. Zahid has more than 10 years of experience in this field, thanks to his father, who taught him the best way to look after cattle.\r\n\r\nZahid usually buys young cattle, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and then resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings 100 AZN of income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nThis is the one source of financial income in his family and not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. Zahid applied for 1,500 AZN to purchase one milking cow, two cattle, and fodder. This will be his 2nd loan from AqroInvest, and Zahid has a good client

For this reason, she is asking Apoyo Integral for a loan which will allow her to buy maize, beans, cheese, corn, chicken, meat, etc. Santos has good references to vouch for her payment history and is very responsible; she guarantees that she will pay off the debt and, at the same time, believes the loan will bring economic security to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1215377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" maize, beans, cheese, corn, chicken, and meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.49,"local_amount":69.49,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":69.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321621},{"amount":37.75,"local_amount":37.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":37.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322930172},{"amount":36.7,"local_amount":36.7,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331925293},{"amount":38.95,"local_amount":38.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":38.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846405},{"amount":40.4,"local_amount":40.4,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":40.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347004275},{"amount":42.14,"local_amount":42.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":42.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450844},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":92.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":92.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082035},{"amount":142.07,"local_amount":142.07,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382264921}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T20:23:08Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:36:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":482187,"name":"Tamaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamaz is from a small village of Vani district.

She says her favorite pastime is to go for a run in the afternoons to relive a bit of the stress of going from place to place.  She belongs to a group called el Moralito and says that they chose this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they live and meet.  she tells us that she sells underwear such as men\u2019s' socks, ankle socks, boys' and girls' socks, thongs, ladies' panties, men\u2019s' boxers, etc.  She has had this business for over 2 years and her sales have been very good. She has customers who place wholesale orders since she gets her stock in Mexico City at the factories where the clothes are made and she gets a better price.  She says that every 15 days she goes to purchase additional stock, since she also makes sales at a small stand she has at a market near her neighborhood on Sundays. She is requesting this loan to purchase more stock and she also wants to set up a larger stand on Thursdays when there is a local market, in order to increase earnings.  She tells us that her dream is to set up a stable business so that she can spend more time with her 3 children, who are all in primary school.  The other 9 members of the group are Juana Guadalupe, Rosa Isela, Maria Felicitas, Oliva, Ana Lilia, Mar\u00eda Virginia, Beatriz, Pablo and Mar\u00eda Elena.

Each of them has a business: Micaela sells clothing; Sandra sells craft items; Reyna sells chicken; Felipe sells bread; and Elodia sells fruit. This group is located in the community of Acatlan de P\u00e9rez Figueroa, where there is a lot of commerce because the people in nearby towns come down to this town to do their shopping.\r\n\r\nMicaela explains that she only finished primary school because her parents couldn\u2019t provide her with more schooling. So, she learned to do housework from the time she was very young, and her parents taught her that she would only get ahead through hard work. She is a single mother and says that since the time she became a mother she has worked very hard to provide for her children. Five years ago she decided to open her own business selling clothing because she realized that she would earn more working in her own business, and she also has more time to take care of her children.

She is 26 years old and only completed school through the third grade.  She is married to Jose Luis who is a day worker and they have two children.  Flor tells us that 4 years ago she decided to start her own business selling cosmetics and perfume to make a little extra money to help out her husband with the household expenses. She started out selling to family and neighbors, and little by little she expanded her clientele.  Today she doesn't only sell in her own community but she also goes to nearby communities to offer her products.  She goes out in the afternoons to show catalogs to her clients and take orders.  She then buys the products and delivers them to her customers.  She is very happy because her sales have given her an opportunity to provide her family with a better quality of life.  A loan from VisionFund will give Flor the opportunity to purchase a variety of cosmetics (lip liners, foundations, eye shadows, nail polish) and perfumes to continue making sales.  She wants her business to make progress every day and hopes that in the future her children will be able to study for a profession. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMaria Esther cosmetics sales\r\nObdulia chicken sales\r\nRosa cosmetics sales \r\nPatricia shoe sales \r\nEstela dessert sales\r\nImelda growing and selling corn\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1212642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase perfurme and cosmetics.

Platica que ella ya tiene varios ciclos con su grupo y que est\u00e1 muy orgullosa de pertenecer a su grupo porque todos se ayudan cuando tienen alguna problem\u00e1tica, platica que ella se dedica desde hace mas de 25 a\u00f1os al cultivo y venta de aguacate y tambi\u00e9n vende chiles manzanos, nopal y duraznos que ella cultiva, dice que ella estudio hasta tercer a\u00f1o de secundaria porque sus pap\u00e1s ya no pudieron seguir apoyando econ\u00f3micamente ya que eran m\u00e1s hermanos. Imelda est\u00e1 casada con Demetrio quien trabaja en la central de abastos de M\u00e9xico y tuvieron 5 hijos pero 3 de ellos viven con ella llamados Carlos: de 18 a\u00f1os el cual trabaja y le ayuda con los gastos de la casa, Vanesa de 16 a\u00f1os la cual estudia la preparatoria y Fernanda de 14 a\u00f1os estudiante de secundaria.

Imelda emprendi\u00f3 este negocio porque tiene un terreno bastante amplio y para poder ayudarle a su esposo con los gastos del hogar, dice que a diario sale a vender a la central de abastos de una poblaci\u00f3n cercana a la de ella; se levanta diario a las 4 de la madrugada ya que su fruta la lleva fresca para que se le venda r\u00e1pido y a un buen precio, ella dice \u201cojala la financiera me pueda prestar el nuevo cr\u00e9dito para poder salvar mis arboles y pueda tener buenas cosechas ya que le he metido muchos insumos para poder mejorarlos\u201d.

She is part of the \u201cEl Ayle\u201d group. She says that where they have their loan meetings is under a tree called an Ayle, and this is why they named the group that, so they won\u2019t forget the name. She explains that she has been in the group for several loan cycles and she is very proud to belong to a group because everyone helps out when one of them has a problem. She says that she has worked for more than 25 years cultivating and selling avocados. She also sells bell peppers, prickly pear fruits, and peaches that she cultivates. She studied through the third year of secondary school because her parents couldn\u2019t continue supporting her economically because she had several siblings. Imelda is married to Demetrio, who works in the Central Groceries market in Mexico City. They had 5 children, and 3 of them live with her. Their names are: Carlos, who is 18 years old and works and helps with the household expenses; Vanessa, who is 16 years old and is in high school; and Fernanda, who is 14 years old and is in secondary school. \r\n\r\nShe says she is requesting the loan from Vision Fund to buy fertilizers and insecticides. She also wants to buy an insecticide sprayer to spray her plants with insecticides because there is an infestation in her trees and she is very worried because this will reduce her harvest if she doesn\u2019t apply the insecticides in time to eliminate the bugs. Imelda learned this business because she has a piece of land that is very large, and also to help her husband with the household expenses. She says that she goes to sell in the central groceries market in a town near hers everyday. She gets up at 4:00 in the morning so that her fruit will be fresh so she can sell it fast and at a good price. She says, \u201cHopefully the lender can lend me the new loan so that I can save my trees and have a good harvest. I\u2019ve invested a lot of inputs in order to improve the trees.\u201d Imelda\u2019s goal is to continue planting more trees. She has 87 trees and she hopes to continue planting because this is the inheritance that she will leave to her children. The other 3 members of the group are named Ivan, Ausencio, and Julia. They will all invest in their avocado crops since they also work in the same type of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1214388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizers, insecticides, and avocado seedlings.

She also dropped out of school because there was no money to continue paying her school fees. Ill health has also been a serious problem in her family, even to the extent of her losing family members. Notwithstanding the above-mentioned difficulties, she also suffers from inadequate capital to start and run a small business of her own, which would enable her to provide her children\u2019s school fees, rent, bills and other items. With this loan, she intends to buy a deep refrigerator, different varieties of fish, potatoes, plantain and other small items.

Israel hopes that with this investment, his work will increase since he will have the materials needed to complete his job, which will in turn help him keep studying .<p>\r\nThe other group members are: L\u00e1zara, who sells Mexican snacks; Azucena, who also sells Mexican snacks; Alejandro owns a hair salon; Sonia, who sells tacos; Dolores, who sells tortillas; Irene, who sells hand bags; and Juan Carlos, who sells apparel.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1212616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to purchase planks, a hammer, nails, measuring tape, cement, and shovels.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Vicente, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T07:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":185,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"L\u00e1zara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azucena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Israel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":13208.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392197},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":13208.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120061},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13208.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068108},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13208.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284845},{"amount":1025,"local_amount":13200,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":13208.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199145}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T17:05:26Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":482200,"name":"Noor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noor is a 48-year-old married woman.

Her husband is a schoolteacher while her son works as a cashier in a restaurant. All of her daughters are students. Aabida herself is a very hard-working tailor and is interested in growing her business. \r\n\r\nTo do that, as a member of a 10-person lending group, Aabida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase a sewing machine and some tailoring accessories like fabric, threads, etc. This will help her to sew more dresses and to more professionally satisfy her clients' needs. With the profit amount, she wishes to open an educational center and tailoring school and to renovate her house. Aabida hopes, with the help of the loan, to reach her desired net income and to be able to save for their future. She dreams of giving her children a quality education. \r\n\r\nMany thanks and greetings from Aabida to all staff of Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Aabida is holding a passbook in her hand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1213239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

In addition, Lia works for local farmers as a daily worker to earn a small additional income. They earn in total 250 Laris per month which is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLia has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framewprk of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lia will purchase calves in West Georgia where the prices are lower than in her region. She will raise and sell them at a good price. This will increase her family's income and she will be able to expand her animal sales business. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions.

He says that he joined the group after it was formed, and it was so named because in the beginning, the group was comprised of only women, all of whom were very hardworking and responsible. He is a widower who lives with his mother, whom he supports and loves very much. He has different jobs but states that one of his passions is singing. Every day, he goes to restaurants and eateries to sing. He says that he is well-known and that people invite him to special events, which makes him feel good because it means that they like the way he sings. He says that when he performs, he goes by the stage name of Marcelo, and that he likes this job because aside from the fact that he gets paid, he enjoys signing for people. He states that he used to have a small cyber caf\u00e9, but that his computers kept breaking down. He also had a video arcade, but he had to sell his arcade games because his electricity bill was too high. He is now requesting a loan from VisionFund in order to purchase a variety of sweets to sell outside his home because he lives very close to an elementary school. He says that his mother well help him make pork and soy cracklings. He hopes to receive this loan so that he can start this business soon because he thinks it will be a success since he also wants to sell soft drinks and juice to the school children during recess.

Her home is located in the city of Imperial which is known for its varied climate and its crop agriculture, especially cotton, maize and others.  Victoria is very charismatic and, especially, ingenious.  She started her own business selling sweets and renting clothing two years ago outside a rehabilitation center.  She came up with the idea because the rehabilitation center only allows entry to women wearing skirts; and one day some women asked her if anyone rented skirts.  After that she decided on the business and, through much effort, has been able to cover her education costs.

Ahora, 5 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s no podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s orgullosa de mi decisi\u00f3n: el Trabajo Social. Encontrar el v\u00e9rtice entre lo que amas, para lo que eres bueno y lo que el mundo necesita, es una suerte de pocos. \n\nDesde peque\u00f1a he tenido gran sensibilidad social, siendo parte de grupos juveniles, parroquiales, y excelentes resultados acad\u00e9micos; producto de ello es la beca como mejor bachiller, entonces decid\u00ed conjugar ambas y dedicarme al estudio de las ciencias sociales. A lo largo de mi desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico he encontrado una gran afinidad con los derechos humanos y me he dado cuenta que su garant\u00eda es fundamental para la sociedad, es por esto por lo que quiero dedicar mi vida a luchar por su realizaci\u00f3n plena. Considero que tengo todas las capacidades para ello, sin embargo, en este momento mi \u00fanico impedimento es el econ\u00f3mico.\nSoy autodidacta: aprend\u00ed ingl\u00e9s de forma independiente y para sostener mis estudios me he desempe\u00f1ado como docente de ingl\u00e9s en varias instituciones. En Brasil tuve la oportunidad de participar como int\u00e9rprete para la ONU en el evento Rio + 20. \n\nMi promedio es de 4.2\/5 y he tenido varias experiencias internacionales; la m\u00e1s importante trabajar en una ONG en Brasil aplicando mis conocimientos profesionales y aportando a transformar la sociedad. \nEl costo total de las aplicaciones al posgrado en el exterior es equivalente a 5 meses de trabajo, sin sumarle que para realizar mi actual pr\u00e1ctica internacional tuve que adquirir una serie de deudas relacionadas con el pago de tiquetes a\u00e9reos, mantenimiento, etc.\n\nUna vez realice mi maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, quisiera trabajar en alguna de las agencias de las Naciones Unidas dirigiendo proyectos de investigaci\u00f3n para el desarrollo de mi regi\u00f3n.

She is currently studying Social Work at the University of Antioquia through a PAES scholarship which was awarded to the best high school student in Colombia.\r\n\r\nLaura's goal is to get a master's in Human Rights from Harvard or the London School of Economics.  The Kiva support will help her pay for her GRE preparation courses, the TOEFL exam registration and application costs to universities, since she does not have the economic resources to pay for it.\r\n\r\nThis is her story:\r\n\r\n\"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\" Mark Twain\r\n\r\nLike for many, one of the most difficult and important decisions for me was deciding what field of study to go into, as a life-long project, to find out why I am here.  Now, five years later, I could not be more proud of my decicion: Social Work.  To find the apex between what you love, what you are good at and what the world needs, is the luck of only a few.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little girl I have had a huge social sensitivity, belonging to youth groups, parishes, and having excellent academic results.  I was granted a scholarship for the best high school student, and that is when I decided to use my skills to study social sciences.  Throughout my academic career I have found much affinity with human rights and I have realized that its guarantee to society is fundamental.  That is why I want to dedicate my life to fighting for its complete fulfillment.  I feel I have the skills for it; however, at this time I am limited economically.\r\n\r\nI am self-taught and learned English independently.  To pay for my studies I have taught English at several institutions.  In Brazil I had the opportunity of working as an interpreter for the UN at the Rio + 20 event.\r\n\r\nMy grade point average is 4.2 out of 5 and I have much international experience.  The most important one was working for an NGO in Brazil, using my professional knowledge and helping change society.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of post-graduate studies applications overseas is equivalent to five months of work, without including the fact that in order to work as a student internationally, I had to take on many costs related to travel tickets, maintenance, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter I finish my master's and return to Colombia, I would like to work for a United Nations agency, managing research projects for development in my region.  During my undergraduate studies I had the opportunity to work on a research project with a UN agency, the PNUD about forced displacement in eastern Antioquia, and we designed an intervention proposal.

From this business she says the community will benefit from regular supply and low prices.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she promises to educate her children, provide medication, pay other dues like electricity bills and food bills, and also to provide medication for her family in case of ill health. She also says she prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, education before loan disbursement, its help in the fight against HIV\/AIDS, and also because the loans given by GHAPE are paid conveniently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1213299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for corn and onions and to do some repairs in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

They live in a four-room apartment at Nkwen Bamenda, in the North West region of Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life which include ill health within her family, and also theft and fighting over property by her family members.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 2003 and has taken and repaid her empowerment credit four times with the recent loan amount being 200,000frs. She says if given the new loan requested, she will expand her fuel wood business, improve her farm garden and raise pigs. She is very positive that her business will succeed because she has regular customers, she has a good business site, and also other GHAPE members are always buying from her to patronize her. From this business she says the community will benefit from regular supply, as well as low prices of firewood, vegetables and pork.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she promises to educate her children, provide medication, and to plow back some of the profit into her business. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, education before loan disbursement, its help in the fight against HIV\/AIDS, and also because the loans given by GHAPE are paid conveniently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1213305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

She will also buy fuel wood and part of the loan will be used to purchase the needed vaccines for the poultry farm. These activities will help the community provide good quality fowls to the public. It will also enable the population to buy wood without having to travel long distances.

She is 72 years old and she only has a primary education, as when she was young her parents thought it best to teach their daughters domestic work and send the boys to school.  She is single and she had two children, who are now married.  She tells us that a little over eight months ago she opened a small grocery store in the front part of her house, which faces the street, so she could earn a little extra money to get ahead.  Francisca is a very cheerful and enthusiastic woman and she tells us that she really wants to work and get ahead.  In addition to her grocery store, she sells prepared food to the passers-by who order from her and this allows her to have more money coming in so that she can keep taking care of herself.  She needs this loan to invest in cookies, candy, soft drinks, juices, rice, beans, oil, toilet paper, salt, flours, matches, and soap to restock her store, as well as a few supplies, such as chilies, tomatoes, onions, and meat to make her prepared foods.  She tells us that she hopes God will continue to grant her life so that she can keep working and get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nReyna- Internet cafe\r\nLoyda-

She is single and only has a high school education.  She says that three years ago she decided to start her own business to earn a little more money so that she could contribute toward her household expenses.  She started selling shoes through catalogs to her friends and neighbors, and gradually gained more customers.  She even goes out to sell in neighboring communities.  Brenda takes orders for her products.  She goes out in the afternoons to show her catalogs to her customers who choose what they like the most and, when she has several orders, she supplies and delivers them.  Brenda is happy because this business has not only given her the opportunity to earn money but has also allowed her to meet people and make new friends.  She will invest this loan in buying a range of shoes and catalogs so that she can continue making her sales.

He tells us that they have two children.  He has had a cybercaf\u00e9 for three years and says he started it because he studied for a career, looked for job after he graduated, was not able to find one, but he already had a family to support, so he started a cybercaf\u00e9.  \u201cI started with four machines and the location is on loan from one of my brothers.  It was perfect for setting up a cybercaf\u00e9.  This time I\u2019m asking for a loan to buy two more computers.  I really like my business and I\u2019m the only one who manages it.  I don\u2019t have a boss telling me what to do.  I also have more customers than a business could have in the neighborhood, since I\u2019m in schools and the health center.  I also maintain the machines and I don\u2019t think I have much difficulty.  I think it\u2019s good that I have two types of internet access; satellite and wireless.  My goal in my business is to expand it and have the basics needed for repair.  I also want to live comfortably without having too many things, but also not too few.  I would like my children to be able have careers.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1207928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Gloria or, \u201cLa Chinita\u201d (as she\u2019s called), is 48-years-old, divorced and had three children with her ex-husband.  Only one of her daughters who is still in high-school is dependent on Gloria.  \n\nShe has a fast-food eatery.  She\u2019s been in business 8 years already.  Gloria says, \u201cMy self-esteem was very poor due to my separation but my brother encouraged me to start a new business and we decided to do so.  We thought about opening a beauty salon because I had studied hair styling but we needed to invest in beauty supplies and hair care tools and I didn\u2019t have money then.  My brother who now lives in Spain always mentioned that I was a very good cook and that\u2019s how I decided to open a low-cost fast-food eatery.  However, in order to start it I still had to borrow money to buy the things that were indispensable starting with the place where I now have my business.  The place my business is in used to be part of my parents\u2019 house which passed on to be my brother\u2019s.  I asked him to sell it to me and he accepted and that\u2019s how I got my locale and started to remodel it into a low-cost eatery.  I learned to cook because I was always stuck to my mother when she cooked and did other things, like driving, which is what I enjoy doing the most.\u201d\n\nGloria relates that her only difficulty arises when prices shoot up and she\u2019s unable to buy the necessary ingredients for her meals.  This leads to losses in Gloria\u2019s business and often she can\u2019t raise the price of her food for her customers.  But thanks to the loan she\u2019s requesting she will be able to buy sacks of rice, beans, sugar and salt, among other ingredients and she\u2019ll also be able to buy new dishes and a blender because the ones she currently has are very old.\n\nWhen Gloria was asked what her goal was, she commented: \u201cI\u2019d love to make my eatery larger because it\u2019s very small and sometimes diners don\u2019t fit in the tables and they have to wait for me to be able to take care of them.
