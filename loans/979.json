She tends to her business from Monday to Saturday.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan in order to purchase skin creams, lotions, and makeup. This purchase will help her to improve her business by acquiring more products. This is in order to offer variety and so that the customers will keep patronizing her business.\r\n\r\nMaria's goal is to build up her business and make it more profitable, so that she can earn better income and provide her children with a better quality of life.

In its two years of business, Mark and two of his sons have worked out of Mark\u2019s bedroom with at least 80 bands and created shows to raise awareness of McAllen\u2019s talents. \n\nMark recalls: \u201cMy son, who we call Fuby, said, \u2018You\u2019re not doing one thing you love: your music. You should be around what you love, before you think about what you make.\u2019\u201d \n\nThereafter, Mark opened a recording studio in his home. \u201cI had the magic wand in my hand, which was my guitar and my talent, and honestly, everything fell in place. I felt accomplished,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t just record; we copyright every song. Our label is trademarked so we don\u2019t have to worry about anything; we protect your music.\u201d\n\nMark began his musical journey when he was nine. His grandfather noticed Mark\u2019s interest and handed the guitar to him, and since then, guitar playing has been his passion.\n\nWhen first seeing various TV commercials and web ads, Mark was skeptical about Accion because he has a negative relationship with banks. But when he learned Accion is a non-profit organization, he decided to apply for a loan. Mark said the loan helped him gain financial security. \u201cI know how to make the loan work for us,\u201d he said. As a natural hard worker, Mark said, \u201cWhen you can\u2019t do it yourself, you have to lean on something, and this Accion loan is what I have to lean on.\u201d \n\nUncomfortable with investing large amounts of what little he could spare, he said, \u201cAccion is helping me get past those fears of risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccion has helped me beat my two-year business goal,\u201d he said. \n\nMark will use the loan for his grand opening. He purchased advertisement, including banners, food, and paid for live music to raise community awareness about the studio. The rest of his loan will go towards working capital. \u201cHonestly, now that we have this, I expect my business to increase 35 percent. People felt uncomfortable in our home. It\u2019s going to help a lot. And we also purchased a coffee pot and microwave for the longer nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as money goes, I feel I make more than I ever would as an employee,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSometimes I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d \n\nMark wants the business to be known as the SolFear Train. He said, \u201cThose who want to be a part of the SolFear Train, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a musician, just that you\u2019re a music lover, supporter, or one who uses music as a tool in life. As we move forward, you\u2019ll learn more about our label through news feeds. But like a train, we only move forward.\u201d \n\nThe label also donated to the Make a Wish Foundation.

partner, Victor, (right) discussed several ideas, such as child or adult daycare, security and party rentals, until they eventually agreed on vending. Both Eduardo and Victor are 25 years old and were looking for something that didn\u2019t require too much work. They strive to give the best customer service, which Eduardo credits with their success. \"Wolf Vending Company\" is currently running on its own by word of mouth.\n\nSince the Laredo business began January 1, 2012, it has been growing monthly. Eduardo steadily obtained his first five machines and began approaching companies by March. His company now operates nine machines. \u201cWhat we offer are canned sodas or bottled drinks. We also offer healthy to salty snacks \u2013 anything that has to do with snacks that\u2019re not hot or cold,\u201d Eduardo says. As a matter of policy, Wolf Vending Company keeps its vending machines well stocked and always completes repairs within 30 days. They also offer liability and workmen\u2019s compensation, meaning that if Eduardo or Victor were hurt while on the job, they are covered and their customers won\u2019t have to pay for any medical expenses.  \n\nFor now, Eduardo employs only himself and Victor. He says that when the demand for his machines eventually grows to at least three times as much as it is now, he will begin hiring others to offer more customer service to their clients.\n\nWithout a loan, Eduardo and Victor would have had to start their business with their own savings. The loan from Accion Texas Inc. was a blessing, he says.  \u201cIt took a load off our shoulders. Yes, we would have been able to afford it, but it would have been tight for our personal finances.\u201d He discovered Accion through one of his former supervisors, who recommend that he and Victor attend seminars presented by the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) in Laredo. Coincidentally, the Accion offices were housed in the same building! So the young entrepreneurs found a great new path to realizing their dreams of business success.\n\nEduardo learned a lot in the beginning, such as how to properly interact and speak effectively with business owners. \u201cWe probably changed our repertoire about 15 times \u2013 I\u2019m not exaggerating,\u201d he says.

The family lives in their own home, located in a native community in the central forest.\r\n\r\nArturo is a very enthusiastic young man. He works in agriculture. Thanks to his parents and the community, he has three parcels of farm land where he grows coffee, bananas, and corn. \"These three products are profitable. It depends on how I negotiated and worked, but I work harder growing coffee,\" he says. Arturo has been doing this for about nine years, and he says that the most difficult part of his job is getting his crops to the city.\r\n\r\nHe invests a lot of money in freight, organic fertilizer, paying workers and others. However, his results from the harvests are satisfactory. He has to fertilize his crops every six months, to ensure their growth and the formation of the grains. This is why this time he is looking for support to get organic fertilizer. He likes his work and his plan for the future to increase his planted fields. This is the second time Arturo has received a loan from MFP, and he is firmly committed to making his payments on time.\r\n\r\n \"Los productores Yaneshas\" is his communal bank and he is glad to have responsible co-members. He likes the idea of saving and the growth of the members as a team. He will invest the money in 15 bags of organic fertilizer to fertilize the land where he grows coffee. That way he is sure to have a good harvest next year. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1216073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy 15 bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":169.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":182.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":195.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":208.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":215.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":149.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":154.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053649},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":169.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":176.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188586},{"amount":70.79,"local_amount":176.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572500},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.94,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":189.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122160},{"amount":158.39,"local_amount":395.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576862},{"amount":83.53,"local_amount":208.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529202},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":210.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":218.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974344},{"amount":1.98,"local_amount":4.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353915}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T15:06:17Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":484035,"name":"Zenayda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zenayda tiene 22 a\u00f1os, es una joven soltera y vive con sus padres en una comunidad nativa en la selva central.\nZenayda es una joven entusiasta y empe\u00f1osa.

He likes farming activities, that's why his main activity is in agriculture, what he does with pleasure. The community gave him three plots of land where he plants coffee, bananas and cassava. In the area, bananas are very sought because of the mildness of the land and climate. Thus, every fortnight Christian harvests 20 arrobas, which he successfully sells in the city of Pichanaki.\r\n\r\nFrom age 20, he works independently, hiring people for the days of harvest and land clearing, and finishing his work on time. When he has a financial emergency, bananas and cassava always bail him out. He plants bananas every 20 days and cassava every four months. His goals are to expand his plots to continue working. \r\n\r\nFor now, he will strive for cleaning his crops and for spreading organic fertilizers he is thinking to buy.

To secure her family's basic needs, she does rice cultivation and vegetable growing. She has been engaged in this business for 28 years. Including this cycle, she is a six-time borrower and her co-member is a first-time borrower. She uplifted her lifestyle with her past loan which she has completely repaid.

Atyrbu is a 48-year-old widow with five children.  During Soviet times, she used to work as a tobacconist.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, she started to get involved in animal-husbandry and agriculture as her main source of income, starting with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, Atyrbu has managed to develop her business: she now owns three dairy cows and their offspring and she cultivates 3.28 hectares (8.1 acres) of irrigated land on which she grows potatoes and beans.  From this business, she makes close to 7,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nAs an additional source of income, Artybu also sews traditional national items such as toshoks (blankets), seat cushions etc...

After the fall of the Soviet Union, she got involved in animal husbandry and agriculture as a main source of income, starting in this business with an initial capital of 4,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, she was able to develop her business and she now owns nine dairy cows and ten head of smaller livestock.

To overcome this challenge, she formed a group of two to seek a new loan. Her past loan has provided her a decent income from her current business and provided her with sufficient daily food. Now she and her co-member are seeking 400,000 KHR and 300,000 KHR, respectively. She, the group leader, is going to use her portion to buy pesticide for her farmland.

The animal in the farm is named \"Brown\".\n\nNancy was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Because they buy asset for smallscale farmers.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Loan must be paid and savings must be done.\"\n\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Nancy replied \"Will reduce workload. Therefore there will be more time to do other jobs.\"\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Nancy owns the following: a cow, pig, poultry, and an automobile,  but does not own a pump, bicycle, or motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, and DVD, but does not have solar power, or a sewing machine.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She is married and a mother with one child aged 4 years old.  She has two additional dependents at home. In 2007, Elizabeth established her general merchandise business at Waterloo market. She began her business because her parents forced her to marriage at an early age without her completing her secondary school education. She works at the business 11 hours a day and 7 days per week.  She says that the main challenge to her business is transporting the goods from the purchasing place to her store. \n\nElizabeth requires a loan in order to buy different kinds of general stock items like rice, salt and oil.

They work very hard to offer their children a better quality of life. Lelis's work is selling snacks such as cookies, cereals, candies and more as well as bottled and fresh juice. She makes the fresh juice from delicious regional fruit such as papaya, pineapple and oranges. She sells everyday starting very early from the sidewalk in front of her house where she has a sales stand. Her business is very profitable because her house is close to a preschool and a high school. These become great allies when it comes time to sell. A lot of mothers want their children to drink refreshing juice to start their morning and study happily. What she likes about her job is that she can use her time as she likes because she is independent and she organizes her days according to what she needs. This way, she can be with her family and do the housework. Over time, she hopes to establish a formal business where she can work more comfortably. This is loan number 5 with the MFP institution.

Her main challenge is flooding and pests which reduce her crop production. \r\n\r\nShe has been with VisionFund for two cycles and has paid back with success. She has wisely managed her past loans to attain a better standard of living for her family.

She lives in the Telavi District with her husband, Shalva, her 3-year-old daughter and her mother-in-law. Marina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small income of Shalva, taking wood from the forest and selling it in their village. It makes a total of 200 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to re-start-up the family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Lice has been supplementing this income by also selling clothing for the last three years with the help of her daughter.

Lice hopes to continue in this way to work and at the same time fully attend to her responsibilities at home. \r\nHer biggest dream is to establish a formal, productive business out of her own home and break into food sales.

She is married and has two adult children. They all live together in their own house.\r\n\r\nLita's business consists of a public-transport vehicles rental. She has four mototaxis, which she rents out everyday to drivers that come to her house looking for a means to work. She gets paid for this service and the profits make it possible for her to cover the basic needs at home. Sometimes, it is her children or siblings who drive the vehicles, and sometimes friends. All her vehicles are in good shape. However, the legal documents of two of them are close to their expiration date.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in this line of work for ten years, and she started from scratch, with optimism and commitment in everything she does. Sometimes, she complements this activity, with her son's help, selling fish that she sends to other cities. What she likes about her job is that she has time left to spend close to her family and to take care of the household chores. Besides, the economic income she generates makes it possible to cover everyday needs at home. \r\n\r\nShe is doing well so far. She hopes to continue this way, so that her vehicle fleet increases in number. This is the second loan with MFP.

She lives together with her partner, with which she has two adult and independent children, who work in order to given their children education and food. Carmen's work consists of selling clothes and products on catalogues. She has been doing this for eleven years now at her house.\r\n\r\nWhen there are not many customers during the day, she goes out and sells her products among friends, neighbors and relatives. She also goes sometimes to some villages close to the river, where she exchanges some products that she sells later on, either at the market or in her neighborhood. She now wants to start selling groceries, because in her neighborhood there are no shops and she has seen the opportunity to improve her income. \r\n\r\nCarmen loves her job. She likes to have contact with people, and her joy and cleverness make it easy for her to continuously attract customers. In the future she wants to open a shop where she can display the garments more properly, since she has been thinking of selling clothes full time, although leaving time for the household chores.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixteenth loan with MFP.

She is a married woman and mother of two children. She lives with her husband and children in Kamalen Sirakoro, a peripheral neighborhood of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nKadidiatou has been buying and selling used clothing for about three years now. She has a strong reputation in this line of business and receives lots of orders, especially in the cold season. So, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso program about two years ago. This is her third individual loan through Soro Yiriwaso. The two previous loans were both correctly repaid. With this third loan, she plans to buy 4 bales of various types of used clothing (sweaters, T-shirts, shirts, and socks) from wholesalers. She travels around, reselling her goods to a clientele made up of mostly heads of families in her town.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to earn a monthly profit of 190,000 FCFA, which she will mainly put towards family expenses and paying off the interest of her loan. She will invest the rest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1217764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy bales of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103098},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243363},{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":60727.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624941},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922644},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636195},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029748},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029749},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819338},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":30363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678245}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T03:10:43Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holden Ferry","image":null}},{"id":482797,"name":"Amjad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amjad is 26 years old, a vigorous, married woman who lives in the town of Raiwind. \r\n\r\nShe has been in the business of hand embroidery for the past five years.

During the seasons when demand is high, she sells in the communities on the riverbanks, where she also exchanges clothing for domestic animals.  She raises, feeds, and sells the animals.  She has been doing this work for over 11 years.  It has been going very well for her ever since she started.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the need to care for her minor children has caused her to think about establishing a business that would allow her to be at home all day and to generate income.  That is why she now wishes to rent video games.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she always has customers who need an article of clothing.  What she does not like is having to travel for hours transporting the heavy bags of merchandise.  Now, she is putting all of her hopes in the new business activity that she wishes to undertake.  Although, she confirms that, in any event, she will continue selling clothes.  However, this time she will sell at her house.  In order to do so she needs to have a good area to display the clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan with MFP.  She has always been known in her group as a responsible person.  She is happy for the opportunity given to her in order to make a good investment.  Also, she is sure that she will continue making her payments on time, like she has done so far.

He is married and a father to two sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Ayoub has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family. He is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. This will increase the taxi capacity to work extra hours and enable Ayoub to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Toktobubu has now approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS for the purpose of further developing her business.

She is married and has six children who are now grown and only two that now live with her: one boy who is 31 years old and her daughter who is 27 years old. Together, they live in their own house. Nilda's work consists of retail selling of groceries, that is to say, she buys the products in great quantities and from there she sells them in small units.She has a small store installed in a space in her house, which she was able to construct due to the support of her spouse.\r\n\r\nAmong other products that she offers, she has rice, sugar, eggs, oil, canned goods, soft drinks, condiments, and others. Her schedule starts very early in the morning and ends at night. She has been in this line of work since she was 15 years old. Thanks to this job, she has been able to educate her children and outfit her house with some fixtures. In general, she works by herself and in some cases receives the help of her daughter while her spouse, son, and grandson work outside the home.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she has time to do multiple activities inside of her home. It is going very well for her, since she always has customers to attend to, her income is considerable, and this allows her to purchase her products on a continual basis. For now, she prefers to continue with what she has, frequently purchasing the same quantities of products, but later she hopes to implement some changes in the infrastructure of her store.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP. She was always a very good member in the community bank, where she is highly valued for being a responsible and supportive member.

This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Olia will rent commercial space and start a general store.

He lives with his four wives and their children in Medine, one of the more popular neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso. After having tried several other businesses, such as agriculture, without success, Issa quickly immersed himself in the business of stocking and reselling bulk quantities of sugar, shea nuts, and cereals, has been doing so for the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nIssa has a solid reputation and receives many orders from outside the region, but he lacks the necessary resources to be able to meet all these requests. As a result, he began working with Soro Yiriwaso around four years ago and has already received four loans, all of which were fully repaid.\r\n\r\nIn order to better meet his growing customers' needs, Issa is requesting his fifth loan which will allow him to purchase 20 bags of sugar, 4 loads of corn, 15 bags of millet and 15 bags of shea nuts. He stocks up in the surrounding regions of Sikasso to be able to stock his store, and to eventually send the supplies to Abidjan and Bobo Dioulasso (located in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso, respectively) upon orders from sugar and shea butter factories. The cereals are sold on site at both wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Issa plans on earning a monthly profit of 275,000 francs CFA. With the profit earned, he hopes to take care of his essential expenses, those of his family, paying off the interest on his loan, and investing the rest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1217760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":253031.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624940},{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":253031.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636194}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T01:20:11Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":483688,"name":"Irma Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irma de 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer responsable, alegre y muy querida por las personas que consumen sus productos, ella se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas, las cuales est\u00e1n elaboradas a base de ma\u00edz y que son fundamentales en cada comida, por lo que este es un negocio estable y retribuyente.

She began her business in the municipality of Soledad, to the south of Barranquilla, purchasing a refrigerator to sell beer, lunches, and liquor, but after 9 years her family and her moved to Barranquilla to a neighborhood called La Playa. This location is better because it is a touristic location where the people go to swim in La Cienaga, a coastal lake. Now she sells her products to neighbors and visitors from a fixed location that she succeeded in purchasing after many years selling there.\n\nNow Maria is applying for a Kiva loan to purchase a freezer to store her products. She also wants to purchase a greater number of beer directly from the truck, which is cheaper and has no intermediary. She thinks she will be able to sell more beer if she can refrigerate them, because people always want cold beer. Maria hopes that with the increase in her income because of this loan, she can improve her home, where she lives with her husband, a son of 34 years of age, and an 11 year old daughter, to be able to improve the room conditions and to feel happier at the side of the family who she loves.

She lives with her four children and her deceased husband's large family in the district of Kabo\u00efla II, at the center of Sikasso. After having attempted several different business ideas with little success, Minata discovered the restaurant business, where she has been working for about six years. She maintains her restaurant in front of a school. Every day, her customers (consisting of students and teachers) line up for her quality meals.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her constantly growing customer base, Minata decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has now been a member of the organization for over a year.

He hopes Kiva will be able to help him as they have before through their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1217138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Martin Jilotepeque, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -90.783333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T20:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T20:40:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswaldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":266.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372762},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":266.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981658},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":266.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331965362},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":266.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339745072},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":266.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347062140},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":253,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":269.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489225},{"amount":32.93,"local_amount":246.42,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":262.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515575},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":266.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373129735},{"amount":33.16,"local_amount":248.71,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":264.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381935042},{"amount":33.27,"local_amount":249.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":265.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390798583},{"amount":66.9,"local_amount":502.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":534.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399810203}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T23:00:12Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":485074,"name":"Bakary","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur  Bakary est \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de 47 ans, polygame et p\u00e8re de huit enfants.

He lives with his two wives and their children in Hamdallaye, a popular district in the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nNever having had the opportunity to attend school, Bakary began marketing fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. He has now been running this business for over twenty years. Bakary has a strong reputation and has earned many commendations from his clientele. Unfortunately, he lacks the resources to meet the ever-increasing demands of his customers. With the loan he is currently seeking, Bakary plans to purchase 20 sacks of urea fertilizer, 10 sacks of complex fertilizers for cotton, and 10 sacks of complex fertilizers for corn. Bakary is on his fifth loan cycle, and all four of his previous loans have been repaid in full. Bakary purchases his supplies in Sikasso from a representative of Toguna Industries (a fertilizer manufacturer). His clientele is composed primarily of farmers, some of whom pay in cash, and others who buy on credit.\r\n\r\nWith the income he earns from this loan, Bakary expects to make a monthly income of 175,000 FCFA. He plans to use this income to pay for essential expenditures, family expenses, to pay the interest on his loan, and to re-invest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1217791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizers for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103102},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243367},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624946},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179846},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922648},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":67475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636200}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T00:13:26Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Hahn Leat","image":null}}]}
