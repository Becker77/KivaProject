This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When the price of potatoes goes up, he makes very good money.  In fact, the earnings from one of his recent crops enabled him to build his home.  Now he hopes to increase his potato harvest so that he can have enough money to pay for his children\u2019s education.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Te\u00f3filo always makes his payments on time and says that he is happy with the other members of his Communal Bank.  The money he requested will be used to buy mutton (sheep) and chemical fertilizers for his crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":426909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase sheep & fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T19:20:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2009,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672666}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T01:34:51Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":157050,"name":"Claudia Ivonne","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Claudia tiene 21 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y tiene una hija de 2 a\u00f1os de edad.

She wants to keep her business alive to help her pay for her children's high school and improve her home. Her husband works as a taxi driver. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy basic grains, canned goods, soda, juices, snack foods, and other products to stock up her store because she has little inventory due to high demand.

Victoria is a seamstress who makes sweatshirts and pullovers made of fleece.  This type of material is warm and inexpensive.  Victoria wants to make her children as comfortable as possible, so she wants to have her own home.  Her dream is to build a house and have all the basic services installed.  Using the proceeds from her loan, she plans to buy fabric in bulk so that she can make sweatshirts in order to generate more sales during the cold season.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. Hernan owns a snack business in which he sells roasted chickens with his sister.  This young man is single and supports his mother.  His dream is to become independent and acquire his own location under his name.  The money from his loan will be used to buy supplies for cooking chickens.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Lilian has a business selling food.  She is divorced, so her business helps to support her three children.  The oldest child is close to becoming a lawyer, while the two younger children are in high school.

Her previous loan of PHP 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lanie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Mar\u00eda Elizabeth lives with her common-law husband Se\u00f1or Juan Diego L\u00f3pez Guzm\u00e1n and their 3 children, Juan Daniel, 17, Eduardo, 13 and the youngest, Francisco Javier, 10.  She takes care of the household and also sells tamales, sandwiches and other things.  She has been doing this for five years and says that it is going well since it supports her family.  This business was started by her brothers who live outside the city.  They encouraged her to do the same in the city and this is how she started.   With the loan she plans to purchase more ingredients so that she can work three times a week and bring in more income for her household, save some money and make her payments to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad on time.  She dreams of buying some land to leave to her children for the future.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Antonia invited her to join their communal bank and now she is able to take out a loan to support her business.  The group is called \"The Two Olive Trees\"  because they are the symbols of the Biblical figures Moses and Elias.   The members of the group are as follows: Antonia Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez, who will use the loan to buy cocoa and utensils; Mar\u00eda Elizabeth Gonz\u00e1lez Ju\u00e1rez who will buy ingredients to make tamales and sandwiches; and Edali M.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cultivar arvejas y choclos, lleva 12 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos, hasta el lugar donde los vende en el mercado de Tarma.

In time, she hopes to set up a small stand in the market because she feels that she loses a lot selling at wholesale.\n\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP.  She knows that she has the responsibility to repay on time and is willing to do so.  She is always very aware of all the agreements reached in her communal bank.\n\nShe will use the requested 500 new soles to buy pea seeds since this legume is selling very well in the

","en":"Brenda is 26 years old; she is married and she is the mother to a son who is 4 years old. She only studied in primary school, and due to financial resources she was unable to go any further, as her parents could not continue supporting her. They grow coffee, which she learned to do many years ago thanks to her parents and brothers. After she got married to her husband, they both began making a living growing coffee, because their families had also made a living in this field as a source of income. In the right season they also grow basic grains such as corn and beans, but not as much as coffee. Part of the property is inherited, and they acquired the rest thanks to their savings and the harvest when they pick it, ready to sell and by looking for the best buying price as a strategy. Their goals are the appropriate upkeep of their coffee plantation, as it was somewhat damaged after being worn away, and if possible, to plant two apple trees in the countryside to complete 2.5 This would help to generate more income, and thus to produce more coffee, which would improve income. She wants her son to study, and prepare himself by studying for a degree which would best help him to excel in life and be a prepared man.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1835485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure and fertilisers (over 100) to apply to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenda Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Claire Parsons","image":null}},{"id":1193,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase stock of produce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":11,"posted_date":"2006-11-06T05:41:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-20T16:07:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2006-11-06T16:07:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5289,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is married and has three children; two of whom attend school.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in getting their land sown.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Pierre A. has requested a loan of 180,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":237843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T17:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821554},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357820},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046870},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938488},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396154},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45151.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904031},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126039}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T20:42:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83137,"name":"Dionisio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Dionisio Busto A.,  tiene la edad de 46 a\u00f1os habita en el barrio San Ignacio ubicado en La Concepci\u00f3n, junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida, ella no trabaja pero le apoya con la agricultura , ellos tienen cincos hijos todos mayores de edad los cuales le aportan  con los gastos de la casa , el desde hace veinte  a\u00f1os se dedica a la agricultura , se siente muy contento con el apoyo de Afodenic ya que a trav\u00e9s de sus financiamiento a logrado establecer mas cultivos ya que le han asesorado para que aplique sus insumos en tiempo y forma para que obtenga los resultados que lo tienen muy contento.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He has been running his own business for 4 years. He sells perfume for women and men, air fresheners, tooth pastes and brushes. Todjiddin is the client of IMON since June 2007 and has neither violations nor delinquencies in payment of the loans. Today Todjiddin requests 12200 Somoni as he is planning to expand his business and increase his capital, and after receiving this large income, he would like to thank all those supporting him, and promises to pay the loan on time.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She was born in Manab\u00ed, but moved to Guayaquil when she got married. She's separated and has two children under her care. When she separated from her husband, she had the responsibility to raise her children, so she decided to start selling. At first she had an informal business, but through her hard work she saved money little by little and opened a store.

He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 32 years old, married, and is the mother of 2 children who are 6 and 1 years old. The 6 year old attends school. Adelaide only studied through 6th grade, and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. She lives in her own home with her family and she isn't responsible for supporting anyone financially besides her children.\r\n\r\nAdelaide never left Maputo, she grew up there and has always lived there. She has owned her own business for more than 5 years and doesn't have any other employees. She works from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM. She  learned about this business from her mother 14 years ago, and earns approximately 1200.00 meticales a day. She uses this money to pay for household expenses, and also saves some money each month through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAdelaide has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is her 5th loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (sand, cement, iron, and other items) in order to continue with the construction of her home. Her earlier loans were for 4000.00, 8000.00, and 9000.00 Meticales, and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish building her house and to buy a vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

Josephine has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 25,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase more fruit to sell. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the sixth loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

From now on, she plans to purchase large amounts of dried curd cheeses and melted butters at wholesale prices and resell it during the upcoming winter months when prices for those products traditionally rise. \r\n\r\nFor the future, she hopes to open her own dairy products shop. She smiles all the time and makes people happy even though she works very hard. \"I want to provide my children with a good education and also establish my own dairy shop.\" She is requesting a

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has eight branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

He lives in the town of Isfara. He is married and has a son. Maruf processes and sells dried fruits in the central local market. He is experienced in the business of dried fruits. He purchases dried fruits from local farmers at wholesale prices and after processing sells them to his customers. Because he buys his goods wholesale, his prices are lower than regular market prices. He offers a wide assortment of goods for clients of different means. All this allows Maruf to make his business quite successful, and it brings in a stable income for his family. Currently, he needs a loan of $800 USD to buy supplies so he can continue to offer quality products to his customers. Maruf expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.    \n\nTajikistan\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 33-year-old Florence M. from Mwanza. She is single with one child, who is 10 years old. Florence has been running a beauty saloon since 2007. This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair or blue hair and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee.\n\nFlorence currently earns about $150 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair and blue hair. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Florance thanks you for the support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair and blue hair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010847},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233133},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664924},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105636},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022746},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867986},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757187},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146299},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984461}],"funded_date":"2009-05-13T23:04:25Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":111842,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Loreta L. is 47 years old and is from Dolores, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

It is a unified group that, as cycles pass, has removed members that do not participate until  the most responsible and supportive persons are left.  They all live in the \"El Recreo\" housing development in an area away from the city.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria del Carmen is the new president of the group.  She focuses on the sale of dinner during the week. On weekends she serves breakfast, preparing Patasca [a nutritious sheep and beef soup].  The loan is for the purchase of basic products so that she can prepare her delicious dishes.\r\n\r\nMr. Luis is a long time member who owns a small business repairing cell phones and selling parts in the Plan 3000 [an area in the city of Santa Cruz] market.  The loan is for the purchase of tools and parts for cell phone repair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Noemi is a long time member who has a grocery store in the neighborhood, her store is well stocked.  She considers herself a responsible person, caring for two children and the grandson of a daughter who is in Spain.  Her dream is to open a mini market in the development since she can count on so many customers, her store is one of the most well known in the area.  The loan is for the purchase of groceries in bulk.\r\n\r\nAll of the partners are responsible and hardworking, they are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for their support and for awarding the

She shares six rooms with her children and grandchildren in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nShe has encountered many difficulties in life including the failure to attain a quality education due to the untimely death of her father, and that of her husband in 2006, which has put her into her present state of trying to support her family. In addition, thieves broke into her home and made off with valuable materials and, in 2000, her house collapsed because of heavy rain and wind. With the many problems and the children under her care, she has still been happy because, among  the widows in her area, she is one of those who gets help from GHAPE solving her problems. If given another loan of 400.000frs, she plans to buy day-old chicks, seedlings, and fertilizer. She is convinced that the business will succeed because a previous loan from GHAPE was successful. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide general food provisions so they will not need to incur transportation costs to buy in distant places. \r\n\r\nShe will plough her profits back into her business and use part to care for her family, pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. Sthe also hopes to open a workshop for her son.\r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she receives, the follow-up, and that GHAPE does not ask for collateral, as well as the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

He brings these products from a village called Chibolo in the department of Magdalena. It is known to have more than 16000 inhabitants, alluvial plains, and a few hills. As a native of the region Omar thinks about this place very fondly. He stated out his business when he came into an agreement with a friend to sell something and Omar chose the sale of pork meat. He knew many individuals with much experience in his native town of Chibolo. He started out selling from door to door until he gained a somewhat stable clientele. Later he started out selling form his home and he added other products for sale, such as cheese, whey protein, honey, and poultry. He sells pork on the weekends, averaging between 40 to 50 kilograms. He has a very good clientele among his family, friends, and neighbors. His business is not credit-based. All of his purchases are done in cash and product sales are also for the most part completed in cash. His sales cover his costs and generate a profit that permits him to cover the family's expenses. His liquidity index ratio is good and it is sufficient to fulfill the commitment he plans on undertaking with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). His accounts receivable have a fast turn around as does his inventory. His profitability margins show the efficiency and solvency of the business for future commitments. Omar wants to grow more each day and he needs an additional working capital to attend to his new clientele. For this reason he requests a Kiva loan. it is the first loan that he has with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. He plans on purchasing pork meat in larger quantities. He also wants to increase the days when he makes his ales and to offer better prices.

They live in a rented house because her husband's earnings won't cover both a house of their own and their children's school expenses.  The principal driver behind Martha's decision to start a business was her children.  She discussed her worries about starting a business with her sister, a seamstress, who helped her by sending her clothes.  She began by selling to friends and neighbors and, little by little, she's expanded her business.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha now wants more clothes so that can offer a bigger variety in her store.  That's why she's asking for a US$475 loan, to be repaid in 6 months, that she can use to help her children and, in the future, have a house of their own.  With your help, Martha will make her dream come true.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa familia de Martha est\u00e1 integrada por ella, su esposo y tres hijos a quienes desea brindarles siempre lo mejor, debido a que no cuentan con casa propia y en d\u00f3nde viven est\u00e1n rentando, es por lo que lo que gana su esposo no es suficiente para pagar los gastos de la casa, y los de la escuela de sus hijos.

He is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota where the hot springs of Dangbo are located, in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River, and he is a member of the group GM Miwanou of Hetin Sota. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in B\u00e9nin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing the land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Pierre B. has requested a loan of 165,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating about 2 hectares, in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":165000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821562},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357828},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046878},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938496},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396162},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41250,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":41925.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904039},{"amount":40.65,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126047}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T16:01:40Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83186,"name":"Temukisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Temukisa L. is married with children.

She sells these treats from her house, where she lives with her husband Jos\u00e9 and their five children. Anita loves her job. She began selling baked goodies because she is good at it and because she considers it to be less complicated than other tasks. She states that she doesn\u2019t want the complications of taking people\u2019s clothes to wash, or other services \u2013 she enjoys the simplicity of giving someone a few cookies over the counter in exchange for payment.\r\n\r\nAnita has exciting goals for the future of her family and her business. She has a passion for wanting her business to continue to grow \u2013 and with this being her 6th loan cycle with Esperanza, she has shown commitment to her work. She started out small, and with each loan cycle she has been able to expand her business even more. This has benefitted her family as well. Anita is seeking to build up savings for her children. She will be able to help with any future costs, including university tuition fees. These savings will give Anita the ability to help her family in a greater array of situations that may arise in the future. This is the reason that she is focusing on saving and expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAnita, pictured here far left, is the leader of this group of women named Luz en el Camino (Light on the Road), and her story is emblematic of the other women in her group.

Her charisma is one of her most powerful weapons in her work since she is the person charged with collecting fares onboard minibus #12 which provides urban public transportation services on the streets of Juliaca.  Her workday begins very early in the morning and doesn't end until almost 9 at night.  What she most enjoys about the job is being able to converse with the passengers and make the trip more pleasant.  She has had this job for two years and feels that the most difficult part of it is having to stand all day since the passengers take up all the available seats.  For later in the future she would like to own her own minibus with which to work and earn her own profits.  This is Nilda's fourth loan with MFP.  She is aware that she needs to repay in a timely fashion and is prepared to do so since she does not want to cause any problems for her communal bank where she is a well-liked and admired member.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling confectionary products in the local community. Eleoteria has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Eleoteria joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Eleoteria is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered for sale. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Eleoteria from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Nelia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Nelia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelia has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Nelia is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Nelia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is 41 years old and dedicated to his business selling lunches and occasionally fast food.  His family consists of his wife and three children between the ages of 4 and 14, who are the reason why he strives in his work to get ahead.  This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he has requested the amount of 1,300,000 COP.  He plans to buy a table and ingredients for preparing lunches and fast food such as rice, oil, margarine, meat, chicken, cheese, sauces, and sausages.\r\n<p>\r\nAlirio is from the Department of C\u00f3rdoba, which is located to the north in the part of Colombia facing the Caribbean Sea.  This area is known for its swamps, livestock fairs, festivals (such as the one celebrating the donkey), pageants, and fertile soil.  Here he started his business five years ago selling soups and lunches.  He continues his business in Barranquilla and has since added fast food such as hot dogs, hamburgers, stuffed \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a>\u201d (corn bread), skewered meats, and kernelled corn.  Alirio has an assistant who help every day preparing lunches for his customers and on the weekends sells his famous hot dogs, hamburgers, and cold cuts.  Since he operates his business out of his home, his family is well-known in the community.

This school was founded in 1964. The school is staffed with eleven teachers and has 287 pupils.   \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 7,500,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone can not do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials; some will buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while others will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nNat J. is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in Kossoh Town, near Waterloo, Nat is married to a clerk and the couple has seven children who are attending secondary school. Nat has served in the teaching profession for thirty-eight years now.  Nat will use part of his share of this loan to renovate his house and use the rest to buy seeds to plant in his farm.

of experience are like an open book with many lessons to be shared with new generations, just as Mrs. Jacinta Z. is a woman with a humble heart and great courage to share what she knows.  Jacinta and her husband share in common their knowledge about caring for the land, and while only empirical, this knowledge gives good results and support to young farmers in their region.  Jacinta and her husband have become a type of counselor for many residents of their community.  Mrs. Z. learned to farm because she was born and raised in an agricultural family and when she married, she continued to dedicate herself to this activity.  Her marriage has been blessed by a son who is 17 years old and whom she loves very much.  For him she continues exerting herself in agricultural work, sowing potatoes, beans, oats, and barley.  In the past few years, and above all this past year, the region has been troubled by the terrible cold that beat the central part of the country.  This weather created great loss for Jacinta, and despite the sadness that still burdens her heart, she is determined to continue working.  She is planning to open a grocery store in which she will sell the products that she obtains from her fields.  Mrs. Jacinta Z. and her husband will invest your generous help in the purchase of fertilizers.

For example, do\u00f1a Verni cannot rely on potable water that should be supplied by public water basins.  What's more, like many others, she cannot rely on gas services and must buy gas in tanks.  Lamentably, she lives in a zone where distributors of these tanks do not pass very frequently which is why she has to go to busy streets in the hopes that one of these trucks will pass by.  She longs to be able to rely on these services in her home.  The main activity of this group is the weaving of sweaters, scarves, and other pieces of clothing, in Alpaca wool that they later sell in the \"16 de julio\" market in the city of El Alto.  Currently, they want to be able to increase their production so that they can sell their products to handicraft shops.  It is for this that they need more capital for the acquisition of raw materials to make their sweaters.

The village bank, which is comprised of seventeen members, is located in Tuol Sralau Village in Kampong Chang Province. \r\n\r\n<p> Mrs. Un H. is also a farmer in the local village, where she owns a 1.5 hectare rice field. Presently, however, she faces a small problem in her field, as she needs fertilizer, which is quite expensive. Her husband, Mr. Choem Hoeun, is a motorbike taxi driver who can make US $2.5 per day. He also helps his wife in the field, but their income is small for their family. As a result, Un is asking for a loan to purchase fertilizers in order to produce better crops.\r\n\r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term, but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva

Y. is married and the mother of 4 children, of whom two are enrolled in school. She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Mahukpego of Hetin Sota. She also sells smoked fish and palm oil.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. \r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Rosaline D. Y. has requested a loan of 150,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 2 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":237930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":38700.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357835},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046885},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938503},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396168},{"amount":75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38700.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904046},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126054}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T14:05:33Z","paid_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83202,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is a member of the Orquideas (\u201cOrchids\u201d) Village Bank.
