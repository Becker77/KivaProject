It was formed in the year 2010. Its four members are women from a small rural village called Barpadar. It is situated in the district of Nuapada of Odisha, one of the poorest districts in India particularly known for drought and underdevelopment. Anadi is one of the members of this group. \r\n\r\nThe lady sitting second from left raising her hand in the photo is Anadi. She is the Group Leader. She is 38 years old and is living with her husband, her only daughter who is eight, her two sons who are 20 & 18 and her father in-law. Anadi hails from a very poor, landless, illiterate Schedule Caste (SC) Below Poverty Line family. Anadi's community is socially, economically and educationally very backward and far from the mainstream. One will hardly find graduates in their community. Anadi resides in a small hut with her family. \r\n\r\nAnadi is running a business preparing and selling different items made of a rope that is made from plastic cement bags. She took over the business from her fore fathers who used to make rope from cow and buffalo skin. The items are used particularly for tightening domestic animals like cows, buffalo, sheep, goats etc, for manually extracting water from a well by using a tin bucket and other works related to cultivation. Her husband and younger son help Anadi in the total process from collection of empty cement bags from the contractors and builders, processing of string into small wires and making the plastic rope items to selling the products. They sell them in five weekly markets each week. Her family works 8-10 hours daily to make those items. Her husband procures empty cement bags at Rs 2\/- per bag. In a week, she earns almost 1000-1500 INR from this business. She gets around 40% profits. Her elder son works as a salesman in a grocery shop, but in comparison to all this i.e. the labor, transporting and material costs, this is not at all cost effective. So very miserably, she manages her family. Presently, the stock she buys from her locality is not enough for her to make items for the entire week. Her husband moves frequently to collect empty bags, which is very time and energy consuming and hampers her production. She wants to have enough stock to support her business uninterrupted. The loan will be used by her to buy more stock of empty cement bags and a bicycle for her son to earn some extra income. \r\n\r\nAnadi dreams of building a small pucca (permanent) house for her family and for the marriage of her elder son. The other three members of her group are Rashmita, Debaki and Jasoda who are doing a similar business of making ropes. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase empty cement bags and a bicycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Barpadar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rashmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasoda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T00:40:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":483126,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn makes a living by selling bananas and coconuts.

He lives with his wife, Delfina, and his three children in a house that he inherited from his parents 15 years ago.  He is a leader who is always attentive to the problems of other farmers.  He has many years' experience in the \"el proyecto sierra productiva\", which is a Peruvian agricultural program that helps lift rural families out of poverty through teaching innovative farming techniques.  From that experience, he has acquired a great deal of knowledge about farming.  He has also become familiar with the cities around the country.  \"I know almost all of Per\u00fa.\" he says.\r\n\r\nRight now, he has his own land as well as leased land, which takes about an hour to reach.  There he plants potatoes, peas, lima beans, ollucos (root vegetables grown in Peru, similar to a potatoes) and other agricultural products that he sells at the market in his city.  He works with great care, and thanks to the \"proyecto sierra productiva\" where he works, he has learned to grow his crops organically.  \"Natural products are always good. When I was a child my parents planted in this way,\" he says.  It is for this reason that in all of his conversations with, and advice to, other farmers, he puts emphasis on pre-modern agricultural practices.  Alejandro also makes a living raising cattle, pigs, sheep and guinea pigs, which he owns and cares for with a great deal of dedication.\r\n\r\nHe would like to continue planting and improving his crops.  This is loan number 7 with MFP.  During the time he has been a member, he has demonstrated responsibility and solidarity with the group.  He really enjoys belonging to this organization, and so he promises to be punctual in his payments.  He is also grateful for the financial support he has received during these years.  Alejandro will invest the money in the purchase of organic fertilizers for his crops, and if there is enough money he will buy food for a balanced diet for his animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1216366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizers for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":74.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":77.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447739},{"amount":31.57,"local_amount":78.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":81.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053657},{"amount":32.89,"local_amount":82.23,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":85.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188595},{"amount":33.92,"local_amount":84.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":87.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572507},{"amount":35.08,"local_amount":87.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":90.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122167},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":91.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867993}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T00:57:28Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Wong","image":1005634}},{"id":484690,"name":"Oscar Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al lado de su esposa con la cual tiene 2 hijos de 20 y 10 a los a quienes ama mucho y por quienes trabaja muy duro para darle una vida mejor; la vivienda de Oscar se encuentra en la ciudad de Nazca, ciudad que se caracteriza por tener un clima c\u00e1lido y acogedor, asimismo se desarrolla la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda.

She is a resident of Caloocan, Philippines, and is married to Fernando, a technician and the father of her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continue providing income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local community. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies wholesale and selling them at retail prices. Her regular customers are her neighbors and other members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Teresita is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages and expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her product line. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams of giving her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

She is 50 years old, living with her husband; one son, age 25; and her daughter-in-law, age 22. Prema hails from the very poor, landless, illiterate Schedule Caste (SC) Below Poverty Line category. She is running a rope-making, procuring and selling business. This is a traditional business in her community. Previously, the people of this community used to make rope from cow and buffalo skin. Due to social restrictions and progressive mindset, this has been replaced with plastic rope. These items are specially used to fasten domestic animals like cows, buffaloes, sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nHer husband and son help Prema in all aspects of the business from the processing part to selling of the products in different weekly markets in her locality. Her entire family works 8-10 hours daily making these items. Her husband covers six weekly markets a week by using public transport and a bicycle for selling the products. Apart from this, her husband also goes collecting raw materials from different contractors and builders which is a very time-consuming task and hampers the production. In a week, her family earns 1,500 to 2,000 Indian rupees (INR) which is not sufficient to manage her family.\r\n\r\nPrema wants to increase her income by adding some extra stock of empty cement bags and a self transport facility. She wants to have enough stock to allow her business to run throughout the year smoothly. Prema wants to utilize the present loan to purchase more stock of empty cement bags and to procure ready-made products from her locality.\r\n\r\nPrema dreams of having a bike for transporting and marketing her products as per her own sweet will. She also wants to construct a house, as her family is living jointly in a small house. \r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group (Kshyanaprabha, Dukhli, Bandei, Bilash and Bhumisuta) belong to the same community and are doing a similar business related to rope-making and selling. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing empty cement bags and procurement of ready-made items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Barpadar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T03:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T03:00:11Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kshyanaprabha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilash","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ban","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dukhli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T11:17:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":484731,"name":"Oscar Elias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar, necesita capital para invertir en el cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos, es por eso que esta nuevamente esta  solicit\u00e1ndonos un cr\u00e9dito, que le ayudara en la compra de tres sacos de abono para mejorar su cultivo y brindarles un mejor grano a sus clientes.\n\nEl nos dice que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayudo a mejorar sus cultivos, ahora tiene una mejor capacidad de inversi\u00f3n  y su econom\u00eda aumento para tener una vida agradable junto a su familia.\n\n","en":"Oscar needs working capital to buy supplies to grow grain.

year 2010 by four active women of Khariar town of Nuapada district in Odisha, India. Nuapada district is known for drought and backwardness. Sunita is one of the members of this group, standing second from the left with a raised hand. She is 33 years of age and lives with her husband; one son, age 3; her father-in-law and mother in-law. \r\n\r\nSunita has been running a small mirror-cutting and binding unit in her house and a photo framing shop for the last five years with the active support of her husband. Her husband goes to a wholesale market 200 kilometres away twice in a month and brings back raw materials like mirrors, framing items and cardboard. In her unit, she has engaged two workers for cutting and binding mirrors of different sizes as per the orders of the traders. She supplies these mirrors wholesale to five traders from the same town and one trader from a nearby town. From this business she earns a monthly income of 6,000 to 7,000 Indian rupees (INR). With her previous loans, Sunita has taken a cabin in the heart of the town for marketing her products as well as photo framing.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan and Sunita wants to purchase a photo lamination machine as well as mirrors and binding materials for the smooth running of her business. This will reduce the transportation costs and she will be able to work for a long period. She expects a good return from this investment for the total development of her business. With this extra income, she is planning to repair and renovate the cutting and binding unit she is running in a temporary shed. Sunita hopes to open a mirror showroom in the market with quality products. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of this group are Sanjukta, Sannu and Premalata. They are running a grocery shop, small restaurant and X-ray center respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing a photo lamination machine, mirrors, cardboard and binding materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T03:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T03:50:01Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sannu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":148000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":148000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T15:20:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":483191,"name":"Munhtsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A diligent and honest woman, Munhtsetseg is 45 years old and lives with her two children in a ger in Hovd province, Mongolia.

She is married to Milo, a driver, and is a mother of her children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArlene retails processed meat products. What she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers, then she sell them per piece\/pack with a profit. Products can range from ham to hot dogs, processed pork and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nArlene hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1214776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married to Rally, a driver, and is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlma dreams of giving her family a good life and hopes to give her children a good and quality education through all her hard work in her business.

She is a vendor and opened a small shop in a district of the capital a year ago.  Because of this work she is able to assist her husband with taking care of their family.  Her neighborly relations and her warmth have helped her customer base to grow with time.  Her only problem is that she does not have enough funds to increase the stock of merchandise for her shop to avoid running out of certain items.  This is why she needs a loan which will allow her to buy basic products (sacks of rice, salt, cases of soap, sugar, etc.).  She will reinvest a part of her profits to grow her business, and the rest will allow her to meet her daily needs.

The prime income source of that locality is cultivation. This village is far away from education, sanitation, advanced facilities, etc. \r\n\r\nThe lady standing second from left in the pink sari with raised hand is Sumati. She lives with five family members consisting of her husband; two sons, aged 15 and 13; and one daughter, 5 years of age. Her children are continuing study in school. She is a very kind-hearted person, hardworking and enthusiastic, who always devotes her efforts to getting her family ahead. \r\n \r\nFor 13 years, Sumati has been running a general grocery shop. Initially, she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually, she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Due to her good behavior, her business has grown rapidly. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2008, with her able leadership, Sumati, along with other three women of her small village, formed a Joint Liability Group named Matrushakti, which means \u201cmother\u2019s power,\u201d to take loans from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. All members hail from poor backgrounds in the \"below poverty line\" category. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan of her group. During the last three loans, Sumati has been able to add some grocery items like dough, vegetables, oil, spices, soda (soft drinks) etc. and also a refrigerator for her shop. Every day from the early morning she starts her work at a stretch of ten hours. Now she is earning 500 INR daily from her business. \r\n\r\nSumati wants to keep more stock for her shop but, due to financial scarcity, her husband has to go to the nearest market to buy items for her grocery shop regularly. Due to frequent purchases, she incurred losses in transportation. So from the present loan she has planned to buy merchandise for her business such as rice, sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potato, onion, dough, soda, etc., in bulk. She expects to increase her sales and, thereby, her income, which will serve to ensure the education and welfare of her children. \r\n \r\nSumati hopes to build a permanent cabin in the center of her village for running her business. She also hopes to provide better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Ghame, Jayantidei and Santi running spice-selling and milk-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing of grocery items in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Torli,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T14:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T14:00:35Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghame","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayantidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":112000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T16:52:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":483250,"name":"Pedrita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pedrita is a 56 year old married woman with three grown children from Baclayon, Bohol, Philippines.

Her husband stitches ladies' and gents' garments and school uniforms. He also does repairing and alteration work. The neighbors and the local community are the regular customers of her tailoring center. She earns a minimum of 200 INR every day, which is not sufficient for managing the day-to-day expenses of her six-member family. So Gangabali wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. At present Gangabali needs to purchase sewing materials such as fabric, which is essential for making clothing, some zippers, buttons, threads and hangers. This loan will provide necessary resources to complete her work in time to meet the customers' demands.\r\n \r\nGangabali has a strong desire to give a better education to her children and construct a separate cabin for her tailoring center.

She is living with her long-time partner and three children.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1998, she applied for work as salesclerk at City Colorland. Luckily, she was hired as a salesclerk in the same year. \r\n\r\nNowadays, she manages her rice retailing, frozen foods and boarding house businesses. Aside from these businesses, Juliet also manages her transportation business as her additional source of income.\r\n\r\nJuliet's goal is to earn greater profits, let her children finish their studies, uplift their living condition and have a stable source of income. So, she patiently runs all her businesses to make all her dreams possible.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nTrash is not actively segregated in the Philippines. While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, and paper. They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories and other industries. Shirley also raises pigs in her compound and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nShirley hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and it's where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married with six children, and five of them go to school. She has no additional family members. She sells secondhand clothes. She sells her products on a retail basis and from door to door. She has been in this business for the last 10 years. She works six days a week. She has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT \u2013 SACCO to buy a bale of secondhand clothes.

In particular, Bakur runs a small dairy farm--he has two calves and a milk cow, whose milk is used for cheese products, which are sold at the local open market. In addition, he has a pig and sells piglets locally. Besides, the family grows maize and nuts on family-owned land. Bakur also works as an artisan to earn additional monthly income. He is very hard-working young man, with a great desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan to expand the shed for cows. Bakur will purchase construction materials for a new cattle-shed. The existing one is already too small and doesn\u2019t allow Bakur to plan future expansion of the family\u2019s farming activities. After the building is expanded Bakur will be able to increase the number of his cattle, produce more dairy goods and sell at a good price. This will increase the family income. The increased income will be used for house renovation and all members of the family will experience improved living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1214898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to expand his cowshed ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khantski","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakur ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":73.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.11,"local_amount":76.98,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":80.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045915},{"amount":45.21,"local_amount":72.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":75.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181907},{"amount":46.02,"local_amount":73.64,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565776},{"amount":47.44,"local_amount":75.9,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":78.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115349},{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":80.32,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860833},{"amount":50.44,"local_amount":80.7,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569643},{"amount":52.32,"local_amount":83.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968287},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":85.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":89.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381748719},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":88.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390612644},{"amount":176.18,"local_amount":281.89,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":293.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856403}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T00:43:02Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T14:42:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":483312,"name":"Kitsao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kistao is a dedicated person who has the urge to move forward.

She develops in this environment of tourism that creates a good clientele for her restaurant.

has a good clientele that she cares for with dedication and needs to respond to promptly.  \r\n\r\nHer message to Kiva lenders is the following: \u201cI am grateful for the help received and hope you

She was born in a village and has substantial experience in animal husbandry and growing crops. After she completed her schooling, Rakiba began working in the fields to earn money so she could help her parents. After getting married, she began working in farming again. Rakiba mainly grows wheat, barley and other crops. For the last 4 months, she has been doing this type of business independently, with the help of her husband. They sell their harvest directly to local residents at a price that is lower than what is charged at the market. For the purpose of improving her skills, Rakiba took part in the training course \"Get Ahead\" that was organized by the National Association of Businesswomen. Rakiba plans to set up a business in animal husbandry, and for that reason she is seeking a loan in the amount of 2,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle. She is waiting for your kind assistance.

All\u00ed tiene varios negocios, por un lado  vende carb\u00f3n, mientras por otro alquila mesas, tambi\u00e9n ofrece el servicio de transporte en una carretilla y vende frutas y verduras  frescas. Con estos negocios ha logrado apoyar los ingresos de su hogar, desde el a\u00f1o 1997,  cuando empez\u00f3 a generarlos, pues conoc\u00eda esta actividad ya que la  hab\u00eda aprendido de sus abuelos, en un pueblo de C\u00f3rdoba llamado Planeta Rica. Sadid con la ayuda de su hermana, compr\u00f3 3 hect\u00e1reas de tierras y las dedic\u00f3 al cultivo de limones, mangos, guayabas y ciruelas principalmente, adem\u00e1s de la venta del carb\u00f3n; actividad que emprendi\u00f3 una vez lleg\u00f3 al municipio de Malambo, donde hoy habita y tiene su negocio, al que ha agregado otras tareas productivas. Sus principales clientes son las tiendas, a quienes les vende de contado y a diario, trabajando desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4 de la tarde. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es mejorar su medio de transporte o carretillas, que utiliza para llevar tienda a tienda de los municipios de Malambo y de Soledad, todos los productos que vende y con ello aumentar sus utilidades, todo esto, con el fin de mas adelante pueda incrementar su producci\u00f3n de tal forma, que logre mejorar las condiciones habitacionales, para siempre proteger sus hijos en especial al mayor de ellos,  que se encuentra en estado de discapacidad. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 carb\u00f3n,banano, lim\u00f3n, guayaba, mango, sillas en madera, y una carrerilla para transportar de los productos directamente a su distinguida clientela.  ","en":"Sadid lives in Malambo with her spouse and two children who are 8 and 29 years old.  She has several businesses there.  On the one hand she sells charcoal while she also rents out tables.  She also provides transportation services with a cart and sells fresh fruit and vegetables.  She\u2019s managed to provide household income through these businesses since 1997 when she started them.  She knew this activity because she\u2019d learned it from her grandparents in a town in C\u00f3rdoba called Planeta Rica.\r\n\r\nWith help from her sister, Sadid bought three hectares of land and started to grow lemons, mangoes, guavas and plums mainly and also started to sell charcoal, an activity she started once she moved to Malambo where she now lives and has her business to which she\u2019s added other productive activities.  Her main customers are stores she sells to daily and for cash.  She works from 8am until 4pm.  Her goal for later on is to improve her means of transport or carts she uses to go from store to store in Malambo and Soledad taking all the products she sells so that she can increase profits.  All of this is in order to increase production later on so that she can do some home improvements to protect her children always, especially her oldest son who is disabled.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently asking for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy charcoal, bananas, lemons, mangoes, wooden chairs and a cart to transport her products directly to her distinguished clientele.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1217931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

","en":"Magaly is 45 years old. She lives with her partner and her three children, aged from 11 to 21. \r\n\r\nShe has worked in sales for seven years. She sells merchandise through specialized product guides or catalogs, responding to orders that her clientele place as a result of her pre-sales work. \r\n\r\nThe main products that she works with are perfumes, cosmetics, creams, and  women's accessories. Currently her clientele is increasing, and the demand for these products is moving in the same direction. But her working capital is proving to be insufficient to respond to her potential clientele. This is the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan; the first she is taking out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy products that have become available at discounts in her catalogs, such as women's and men's colognes, perfumes, cosmetics and creams, which she will sell among her customers by extending short-term credit. These are customers she chooses very carefully and for whom she works tirelessly, 12 hours a day. Her aim is to increase her income more and more and achieve her dream of seeing her children complete their education and become outstanding professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1217946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy colognes for women and men, perfumes, cosmetics and creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994428},{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130772},{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519631},{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071472},{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497687},{"amount":60,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":107968.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928266},{"amount":120,"local_amount":210000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":215936.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967721},{"amount":120,"local_amount":210000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":215936.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083163}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T22:06:42Z","paid_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":485190,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su familia conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 5 hijos, en las edades de 8 a 25 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad de Barranquilla.

She sells fast food there and generates additional income renting out washing machines daily to her neighbors.  She started the business three years ago and when her husband became unemployed they decided to start the washing machine rental business, an experience she took from her mother-in-law who worked at that.  Ana also works as a domestic employee and the businesses are usually looked after by her spouse.  Taking advantage of her fast-food cooking skills she started this activity and with all of her activities together the couple supports their family.\r\n\r\nThe main things she offers are cold-cut plates, hot-dogs and hamburgers that are well-prepared with sauces and combinations thought up daily to delight her customers.  In the washing machine business her customers take the machines to their homes to do the washing for all the family members.  Currently, her businesses are in a growth phase and her working capital is insufficient to keep up with market needs which is precisely why she needs to apply for a Kiva loan to buy three washing machines to increase capacity and respond to service calls.  She will also buy sauces, cold-cuts, vegetables and bread rolls to increase offer of products in her food stand.\r\n\r\nThe success of her Kiva loans rests on her business experience meeting growing demand, especially during the second semester of the year which is a season when sales usually increase.  Her dream for prosperity is that the business grows to buy a house of her own and generate greater family wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1217956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her clientele has been gradually growing and she four years\u2019 experience tells her that she must apply for a loan in order to expand the volume of her sales. \r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s called on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo where she\u2019s had one previous loan that helped her increase her buying capacity and her number of customers.  This is the reason behind her applying for a Kiva loan, her second loan from this organization, that she\u2019ll use to buy costume jewelry, steel and silver accessories, that sell very well during the year\u2019s second semester which is when the end-of-year parties approach and people want to look very elegant.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to become a wholesaler of these products and to supply many variety stores that she\u2019s already making initial contacts with.  Her experience and her capacity to make her dreams reality are the most important strength her business can rely on to make her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1217963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy steel and silver costume jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75066},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73707},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75427},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77187},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78988},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80831},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82717},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84647},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86622},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84808}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.22,"local_amount":75066,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75981.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994432},{"amount":41.46,"local_amount":73707,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":74606.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130776},{"amount":42.43,"local_amount":75427,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76347.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519634},{"amount":43.42,"local_amount":77187,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":78128.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071476},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":78988,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79951.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497690},{"amount":45.47,"local_amount":80831,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81817.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527506},{"amount":46.53,"local_amount":82717,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83726.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928269},{"amount":47.61,"local_amount":84647,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85679.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705424},{"amount":48.73,"local_amount":86622,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87678.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967724},{"amount":47.7,"local_amount":84808,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85842.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816931}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T00:13:26Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":485199,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Maria Luisa naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco y vive en la misma ciudad donde naci\u00f3, ella tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad y es soltera.

For over 11 years, he has been growing crops such as potatoes, onions, carrots, and so on. He learned how to farm from his father and is very happy to be a farmer himself now.

district of Odisha, India. The lady standing in the middle of the front row with raised hand is Indu. Her father-in-law migrated to Bolangir 25 years ago in search of work and since then her family is residing in a slum area of the town. In her family she has her husband, one son aged 14, and three daughters aged 10, 5 and 2 years. She hails from a below-poverty-line category. \r\n\r\nTo increase the income of her family, in the year 2010 she involved herself along with other four women of the same category of her locality and formed a joint liability group named Maa Durga to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years Indu, with the help of her husband, has been running two mobile businesses units with push carts. The first one is  selling  a mixture of puffed rice and boiled gram locally known as \u201c'mudhi' mixture\u201d  and second one  is mobile vending of low cost fancy items like balls, cups, plates, glasses, plastic containers, toys etc. in different localities, moving here and there. Her husband runs the 1st business from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm in front of a school area and from 6.00 pm to 9.30 pm in the market area. \r\n\r\nThe timing of the 2nd business is from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon. The role of Indu in running the businesses is to prepare puffed rice, boil gram, pack related items and make the push cart ready to go for selling. For this she has to work for 15-18 hours daily. Apart from this she has another two push carts which she has given on rent to other persons. \r\n\r\nIndu gets a monthly income of Rs.3000-4000 INR from these businesses and it is very hard to manage the household, educational, medical and business expenses.\r\n\r\nDue to financial constraints she could not store more items and has to face losses due to frequent purchase of items at retail cost. So she wants to use the present loan for purchasing of more stock of   gram, rice for preparation of puffed rice, mixture, oil, plastic toys and containers at a wholesale rate to avoid financial losses due to fluctuation of material costs from time to time. She has also a plan to start another two business of chart (mixture of boiled gram, vegetables and spices) and 'Gupchup' selling in other two pushcarts by employing two people.\r\n\r\nIndu hopes to give better education to her children and dreams to construct a 'pucca' house to have better living conditions and to see her children in respectable positions in society.\r\n\r\nThe other four energetic group members are Rashmita, Anandini, Santosini and Pankajini who are doing goat rearing, a mobile repairing center, tailoring and vegetable vending businesses respectively. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1215031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing grams (lentils), rice, mixture, oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rashmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santosini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pankajini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T22:33:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":483403,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua sells maize porridge.

When she was a little girl her parents instilled in her a love of the earth and taught her how to work with it. Now, Anita is part of the group called Los Girasoles (in English: Sunflowers), which happen to be one of Anita's favorite flowers. As a young girl, Anita's parents taught her how to work on the land. Later, since she had not found any other steady job, she decided to dedicate herself to farming. \r\n\r\nFor the last 11 years, Anita has worked growing strawberries because she owns a wide plot of land that she doesn't want to waste. She also works selling milk. Anita has eight milking cows that she wakes up early each day to milk. She sells their milk to various families in her community and in a nearby town. \r\n\r\nAnita says that, \"Thanks to the loans that I have received from VisionFund, my business has improved, my cows are in better condition, and I have been able to grow more strawberries. Before, my earnings were not enough to sow more and to buy the fertilizers needed to grow them.\" Now, Anita is requesting a loan in order to improve her strawberry crop and to buy fertilizers to help them grow. She will also buy food, vitamins, and de-wormers for her milk cows in order to produce more milk. Currently, she gets about 250 liters each day because she cannot milk all of the cows at once. She must let them rest so they will produce more milk. \r\n\r\nAnita's goal is to increase the number of customers she serves. She would like to have a permanent spot in the market in her community where she could also make and sell cheeses, creams, sweet buns, and other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThe other 15 members of Los Girasoles are Graciela, Sof\u00eda, Gabriela, Paulina, Ysabel, Felipa, Sof\u00eda Salguero, Ver\u00f3nica, Teresa, Itxe Ivette, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Juana, Ma. Remedios, Raquel y Mariana. They will use their portions of the loan to stock a grocery store; to buy clothing and shoes to sell; to buy regional sweets, seasonal fruits and vegetables; to buy materials to make work gloves; for vehicle alterations; to obtain second-hand clothing; to buy perfumes and cosmetics to sell; and to buy chicken to sell by the pound."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6950,"image":{"id":1217371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk

For the past 3 years, Shamim has been working hard to manage her small business, where she sells soft drinks and juices. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shamim has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soda, water and other drinks to sell, and will help Shamim to generate greater profits and use the profits to pay school fees for her children. Shamim hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nShamim is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She got the opportunity to buy a colmena [sales stall] in a market and then stocked it with other products already mentioned.\r\n\r\nEvery day Ingris serves her business and offers articles from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.

This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan, first financing she makes to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy belts, compact disks, hats, so she will have a lot of diversity in her inventories.
