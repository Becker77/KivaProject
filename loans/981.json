He and his wife, Isabel, have given their all to provide their children with the values and principles to move up in life. One of those achievements is reflected by having completed the construction of their home. Skilled in the automotive field, Clemente has made a living as a mechanic for the past 15 years. He started out as an employee, which helped him gain valuable experience and confidence. He currently has his own shop, which his wife helps administer. Since he started, he has been very persistent with his work and never let up until the job was done. This allowed him to make friends, who became future customers he has worked with ever since, and made his business the biggest tool he has to make progress. One of his priorities is to acquire more spare parts in order to carry out his work more fluidly, since his clientele is increasing. In this way he will keep working so his business will be able to keep growing, and he will run it with the same enthusiasm in the future. This is his 16th loan, and as always he is grateful for the confidence Kiva partner MFP has put in him since he started investing in his business. He also says that he likes working with his fellow members of his community bank because he can see the progress. He plans to use the loan to purchase parts so he can keep his shop well

desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, atendiendo a la inclinaci\u00f3n que desarroll\u00f3 desde muy joven, por la cosm\u00e9tica y la est\u00e9tica y que posteriormente tradujo en lo que es hoy un negocio, donde ofrece servicios de mejoramiento de la imagen personal, a trav\u00e9s de cortes de cabello, masajes, peinados, pedicure y manicure. Inicialmente cuando empez\u00f3 su actividad, lo hizo para apoyar los gastos de su hogar, pues hasta ese momento se encontraban a cargo de su esposo. Poco a poco su negocio ha crecido y hoy apoya mas el bienestar de su familia y adem\u00e1s de sus vecinos, tiene como clientes a referidos por estos, a quienes dirige todos sus esfuerzos de mejoramiento, para fidelizarlos, porque son la raz\u00f3n de ser de su negocio. Sandra trabaja desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 7 de la noche diariamente y sin descanso, y all\u00ed tambi\u00e9n asesora en imagen y vende productos cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios femeninos, perfumer\u00eda entre otros asociados a su negocio.

El crecimiento de su negocio es evidente y cada vez mas siente que su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para responde a su expectativa de crecimiento y a su misma demanda. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 tintes,  alicer, plancha, pintura de u\u00f1as, cosm\u00e9ticos y accesorios encargados por sus clientes para continuar el camino al \u00e9xito y con su credikiva aprovechar\u00e1 para tenerlo organizado en su otro local donde sabe que se mover\u00e1 mucho comercialmente. ","en":"Sandra, 41, is the owner of a beauty salon located in her home that she opened 10 years ago, given her inclination from a very young age for cosmetics and beauty.  Later this translated into what today is a business where she offers services for improving the personal image through haircuts, massages, hairstyling, pedicure, and manicure.  When she first began her activity, she did it to help with the household expenses, but up to then they were her husband's responsibility.\r\n\r\nLittle by little her business has grown and today she supports the well-being of her family as well as of her neighbors.  Her customers are referred by them, for whom she devotes all her efforts to improve, so she can cultivate their loyalty because they are the reason for her business.  Sandra works from 8 in the morning until 7 at night every day without resting.  She also does image consulting and sells cosmetics, women's accessories, perfume, and other things associated with her business.\r\n\r\nShe feels very satisfied with and stimulated by her job because it's well located near a very busy boulevard in the southern part of the city where a lot of people go by who know her.  She's going to move to a place away from her house, though, so she'll have more quiet at home.  The growth of her business is clear, and more and more she feels that her working capital is not enough to respond to her expectations for growth and to her own demand.\r\n\r\nThis is why she's getting a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She'll buy dyes, straightener, an iron, nail polish, cosmetics, and accessories ordered by her customers so she can continue on the road to success.  She'll make the most of her Kiva loan to have everything organized in her other place, where she knows she'll sell a lot.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1218157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He is single father raising two minor children: Emilia who is 1, and Carlos, who is 12. He works hard, thinking of his two big motivations. He owns a wooden house he acquired a short time ago.\r\n\r\nHe works as a cacao grower on the land he acquired 7 years ago thanks to a loan from his parents who have also been a big help with raising his children.  \r\n\r\nHe considers his work to be very interesting since he likes to lead and participate in the activities, whether they be maintenance or harvesting. Sometimes he has had to deal with some pests that disturb his land, damaging his production considerably. He considers his work to be very profitable because of the quantity of cacao he usually produces every season. This is part of what motivates him even more. \r\n\r\nAmong the things he plans on prioritizing the finalizing of the season and beginning the new one. To do this he has to acquire seedlings, organic fertilizer and tools to do his work with no problems.

last 1.5 years. She is passionate about her work, and client demand is strong. But business challenges, combined with family expenditures, frustrate her nearly every day. \r\n\r\nHer father is employed as a guard in a small factory with a low salary to fulfill the needs of the family alone. That is why Naila is working to contribute to the family income. Her beauty parlor is very popular on her street, and she is the best earning resource in her household.\r\n\r\n In order to cater for more customers, she needs to have more products for her parlor.

Now she has two buffaloes and one cow. This has all happened due to her courage and determination. Because of her work, she is respected in her home. She helps her husband in all family matters as well as in financial matters.

She is 36 years old and mother of five children all of whom are students. Her husband is a small commission agent, who is without fixed employment. She sells drinks (Primus, Orange soda). She sets up her merchandise in her little kiosk. She started her business with her own money given to her by her husband. Later, she was the beneficiary of an additional sum from the IMF Hekima credit fund. She has been running these small businesses to assure her family's survival for over five years. However, she has now accomplished 18 loan cycles taking advantage of the IMF Hekima micro credit programme. Insecurity due to incivilities in town constitutes a threat to the development of her business. Thus, for this reason this loan has been diminished. This new loan will enable her to stock up with drinks (4 crates of Primus, 3 crates of orange soda, etc.). In addition, she hopes to see her children grow up and to create a bistro.

He is a sheep breeder and has 20 head of sheep in his herd. He has 16 years of experience in this field.   His wife is a housekeeper, who keeps house and helps her husband to look after sheep. He also has a garden where he raises seasonal fruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nThe village where Eyvaz lives is located in the southern part of Azerbaijan, which has very rigorous climate conditions. In the summer the temperature reaches 105 degrees fahrenheit.  The main problem in the region is water for irrigation and for animals.  Eyvaz is not able to build a water channel for his garden alone. This is quite an expensive process which requires a labor force and special equipment.   When he heard about water loans, he was extremely excited and applied for a 2000 AZN loan. He will use this loan to pay for special equipment, like a tractor for making a water channel, and to hire workers who will dig the land.\r\n\r\nHe is a trustworthy client of AqroInvest and has a good client history.

He has 14 years of experience in this field. He is single and his brother and mother help him to run the business. His monthly income is 300 AZN and he has only one wish now--to pipe water to his fields and to his house. Now to water his cows he pastures them to about 1 kilometer to the nearest river. \r\n\r\nWhen he heard about water loans he was extremely excited and applied for a 2000 AZN loan. Making a water channel is quite an expensive process which requires a labor force and special equipment. He will use this loan to pay for renting special equipment like a tractor for making a water channel and for workers who will dig the land. This will be his fifth loan and he has a good client history.

It was then she began as an entrepreneur, offering breakfast to those who little by little began eating lunch as well. She served ready-to-eat meals and special weekend dishes in her home. \n\nMaria begins work from 4:00 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon. \n\nHer primary customers are teachers in the local district schools, neighbors who know the quality of the food well, and those who save up for meals especially on weekends. \n\nCurrently, her dream of growth has not stopped.

They both live with their large traditional family in Medina, one of the popular districts in the city of Sikasso.\n\nFor over two years, Kalidou has been running his business buying and selling mobile phones and their accessories (face plates, batteries, chargers, earphones, etc.). He conducts his business in his own shop located on the side of a very busy road, and his clientele is composed of people from all walks of life. He is very sought after by his clients due to the high quality of the products he sells.\n\nIn order to better serve his ever-increasing customer base, twelve months ago Kalidou decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his second loan with the institution. With this loan, he plans go to Bamako (the capital of Mali) to purchase 15 DVDs, eight televisions, 45 mobile phones of different brands, five cartons of face plates, 15 phone chargers, 25 packs of memory cards, 15 cartons of batteries, and 12 dozen assorted earphones.\n\nHe hopes to earn a monthly income of 275,000 FCFA.

He is a father with two children, aged 6 and 8, who go to school. Joseph is a merchant and has opened a small shop. He has been selling phone accessories and phone minutes there for seven years. His business is due to having a good location and to his experience in this domain. This has enabled him to grow his customer base over the course of time. \r\n\r\nJoseph is requesting a loan to increase his stock of phone accessories, as well as phone minutes, thus enabling him to avoid merchandise shortages, with which he is often confronted, since his meager capital compels him to sell a good part of his inventory in order to be able to stock up again. He would not only be able to satisfy his customers further but also to increase his sales and therefore his profits. \r\n\r\nHe will reinvest part of his profits into his business to expand it.

It\u2019s a group of four people each with a different productive activity and this is why they are requesting a loan to invest in their respective activities.  For example, Juan will invest in his raspberry nursery, Guillermo and Cecilia in a grocery store and Virginia in a nixtamal [corn for making tortillas and tamales, etc.] mill.  They chose this name because Alcatraz means abundance.\n\nJuan is the group representative, he is 28-years-old, unmarried and has always lived in the community.  For the moment, he\u2019s living with his parents and Juan has a raspberry nursery.  He got the nursery thanks to support he received from the father of his girlfriend.  Juan commented: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about raspberries but we received some training where I learned how to plant them and how to make them grow and obtain a good harvest.\"    Juan has been doing this activity for 8 months now and the only difficulty is the lack of resources to enlarge his business.  He is requesting the loan to buy tubes, raspberry plants and the rubber.  Juan is motivated most from seeing the amount of harvest he got during the last six months because the raspberry harvests are exported to the United States.  Juan says, \"Although I do well in my business I\u2019d like to make it bigger to improve my quality of life and to make some home improvements, among others.\"  Juan is very grateful to the institution FRAC because thanks to the loan he will be able to buy what he needs.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1207921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy rubber, raspberry plants and iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-18T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-17T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392187},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120049},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068096},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284833}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T23:23:05Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":483890,"name":"Geoffrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George  is a married man.

She wants to slowly grow within the market and keep improving the quality of life of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1219090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy apples, bananas, papaya, grapes and strawberries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2012-10-18T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-17T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":22.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":23.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":24.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":26.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.35,"local_amount":22.35,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":22.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315683188},{"amount":24.51,"local_amount":24.51,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":24.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323085038},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":46.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339607606},{"amount":25.27,"local_amount":25.27,"processed_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347156493},{"amount":26.47,"local_amount":26.47,"processed_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356561393},{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":27.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":27.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364615812},{"amount":28.17,"local_amount":28.17,"processed_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373196082}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T21:51:43Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elisabet Falgueras","image":1166834}},{"id":483904,"name":"Victo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victo is married with five children, and four of her children go to school.

He opened a ready to wear boutique in a quarter of the capital that he has been running for six years. His warm welcome, his creativity, his good advice about clothing, and his experience have gained him quite a large clientele. The growth of his clientele has become a problem for him as he can no longer satisfy all of his customers due to his small capital. This means that he has to go to sales every weekend to purchase his stock retail and to come back to sell it.

There, he sells dried staple foods (peanuts, beans, salt, \u2026) With this small business, he is supporting his small family. His business is operating, but he has just one problem involving capital funds that prevents him from purchasing large amounts of goods to sell.

Mwadji started her business with funds from her husband that amounted to the equivalent of a container of oil. She is a vendor of palm oil at the central market of Virunga and has been in this business for ten years. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, this client would like to increase her sales by purchase 15 containers of palm oil. She also sells plastic footwear (slippers) to increase her revenues. For the future, she plans on switching her business to general commerce and building a comfortable house.  \r\n\r\nThis client salutes the initiative taken by the microfinance institution Hekima dedicated to autonomy for poor women having no access to banks. The dividends from this Hekima micro-loan are enormous for this client, she says. She remained away from her children for a long time due to the repeated wars in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

She has worked in computer repairs for the last 8 years. She works with her husband; they do work in people's homes and sometimes work from home. They specialize in fixing keyboards, mouses, screens, hard drive information, adding programs and computer cleaning. They buy the goods and supplies they need from local shops and computer distributors at a low cost, which is economically advantageous.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy a hard drive, get internet service (to download programs), and advertise the business. One of Carmen's goals is to have her own shop where she can attend to her clients more calmly, and this way opt for a better quality of life and be able to give her children economic stability.\r\n\r\nCarmen lives with her husband (with whom she works) and their two children, ages 8 and 4.

She says that the training has been critical for her business as well as for her personal development, as she has learned to organize and distribute her supplies and investments in a better way. With regard to the communal bank of which she is a member, she says that they have very good communication. \r\n\r\nAngol is located 128 km. northwest of Temuco (capital of the ninth region) and 608 km. south of Santiago (capital of Chile).

Rosemary applied for this loan in order to buy tables, chairs and decorations, so that she can open a new business which is a nightclub. \r\n\r\nHer reason for requesting this loan is the lack of working capital for this new business. Rosemery is facing challenges in her business such as having to work until the early hours of the morning. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use the profits to continue investing in this, her second livelihood, as her wish was always to open a nightclub.

She reports that she started this business gradually; that is to say, she cut out patterns and experimented with them, and she began to enjoy it more and more, so she started to take various courses and made a business out of it. At the beginning it was difficult for her because she had to promote herself to build up a network of customers. It was five years ago that she started her business, and it is now going very well for her. She works every day from 9 in the morning until 1 in the afternoon, since she has another job. Since she is a single mother, she has 2 jobs, and thanks to this and to the effort she puts into her work, she has been able to make progress up to now. Heidi comments that one of her difficulties is her location, because she would like to locate her business in the outside area of her home, opening a sizable store where she can exhibit the crafts she makes. With the loan she will buy materials to make her products, such as foamboard, fabrics, thread and other items. She hopes to continue working so that she can keep supporting her son and get ahead in the profession she has chosen.

In 2000, Iye Bah established her food stuff (provisions and vegetables) business. She began her business because she dropped out of school in Form II, and the tribe that she came from does not value girl child education. They believe a woman's place is in her husband's house. She was a victim but she was lucky because her husband is a businessman who trained her and gave her a reasonable sum of money to start a business of her own instead of being a housewife.  Working 6 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 484,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Iye Bah has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase shrimp Maggie - 6 cartons @ Le 260,000, onions - 10 bags @ Le 90,000, Oil - 9 rubbers @ Le 160,000 and Le 100,000 will be used for transportation. In the future, Iye Bah plans to expand her business; the loan will help as she will be able to generate income. Competition is high, but with many goods she is able to lead in the market.

With much effort, he learned everything needed to work independently from one year ago by renting some plots. \r\n\r\nHe started as a laborer working in different fields where he gained experience and trust from the local people, and that allowed him to access to rent a whole plot to precisely get the most of it so he can meet the payments. He admits that it wasn't easy at the beginning due to climate changes, but after a while he ended up adapting to the environment. \r\n\r\nOne of his greatest long-term desires is to buy a plot so he will work with more confidence. He has also planned to start growing other products such as achiote and barbasco, among others. When the cocoa season starts, he has planned to buy organic fertilizer, copperwood and tools very necessary to carry out his activities in the best way possible. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with which he commits to comply with all his installments because in the future he plans to apply for a loan to start buying his own plot.

When her father died, they sold some of their father\u2019s properties and shared the money. She used her share to start her business. Working seven days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 2,000,000 leones (SLL) every month from the business. She is a hardworking and honest businesswoman. \r\n\r\nMariatu would like a loan of 5,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan in order to purchase under vests (3 bales @ 800,000 SLL) and bodices (4 bales @ 650,000 SLL). There are times when some bales will not be of good quality. In the future, Mariatu plans to build a house, educate her children and acquire a shop.

She is a very happy and amicable woman. She has a partner, Epifanio, who is 52 and with whom she has three children, Luis, Kelvin, and Jhon, who are always watching out for their mother. Their pleasant home is located in a house made of wood. Among the capabilities that she found to raise her family together with Epifanio, she dedicated herself to filling the field where for 15 years she has produced a tremendous variety of products, among which she considers coffee and cocoa the most profitable.\r\n\r\nShe likes her work, since it is an activity that her parents also always performed, although among the things that she finds difficult is the rainy season, because her parcels of land are affected by the rivulets that damage her plantings considerably. It is for that reason that she needs to invest, in parallel to her crops, in laborers to do some excavation work to avoid being affected as occurred in the past. During the period in which the planting is begun and the crops, preferably cocoa, are maintained, she needs to have everything necessary to eventually obtain an optimum result with regard to the quality of her products, among which the essential item is the organic fertilizer, as well as planting the seedlings.\r\n\r\nIn the future she has thought of growing trees for timber on her land and working on its reforestation, inasmuch as she considers it possible to make money with responsible cutting. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan, and she already feels obligated to make her payments punctually. She feels very happy about the way she works with her fellow members of her communal bank, since they are very responsible people. With the 2000 PEN that she will obtain, she will complete the purchase of plenty of organic compost as well as seedlings for cocoa, which she is thinking of working on in the next season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1219270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy organic compost as well as cacao seedlings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":214.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":233.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":241.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":238.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":256.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":265.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":269.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":214.45,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":214.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053687},{"amount":90.48,"local_amount":233.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":234.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188624},{"amount":93.45,"local_amount":241.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":241.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572536},{"amount":92.27,"local_amount":238.11,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":238.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122196},{"amount":99.57,"local_amount":256.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":257.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868022},{"amount":102.84,"local_amount":265.4,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":266.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576875},{"amount":104.44,"local_amount":269.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":270.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529213},{"amount":108.85,"local_amount":280.91,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":281.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974357}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T05:12:10Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":484209,"name":"Hamoud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamoud is 44 years old and a happy man who treats everyone well because of his opportunities to get ahead.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and a personal business.  She has 1 child and has been doing this farming work for 8 years.   \r\n\r\nJeniffer stated what is most enjoyable about farming is seeing her hens grow lay eggs and she loves seeing them lay eggs and also the income from them. Her biggest challenge is getting enough feed for her broiler hens.  She will use this loan to construct a dairy unit and buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nJeniffer was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'From another Juhudi client.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'She has learnt more on animal husbandry.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Jennifer replied that she will be able to educate her child who is now in university, and she will also be able to feed her family.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jennifer owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

She has 5 children and has been doing this work for 14 years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services, and a personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is: she loves her cows very much and seeing them makes her happy.  Her biggest challenge is high drug prices, more so when the animals are sick.  The animals on the farm have been given the names of Sofia and Maritat.    She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nSalome was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Heard from another existing client.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Learnt about co existence with other members, leadership and loan management.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Salome replied 'By acquiring another cow she will be able to increase her asset base also the family income will go up.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Salome owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1216262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Her primary income sources are milk, crops and a job salary. She has five children and has been doing her work for 10 years.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what is most enjoyable about farming, Jepkosgei says she loves animals and she enjoys feeding them. When asked what is her biggest challenge, she says, \"Feeding the animals can be hectic sometimes.\" The animals on the farm have been given the names <i>Sambu<\/i> and <i>Kendo Goch<\/i>.\r\n\r\nJepkosgei was asked how she learned of Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"from another client\". This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She says she learnt more about farming as a business. She will use this loan to construct a modern dairy unit for her dairy cows and buy poultry birds as well.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is business-related. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Jepkosgei replied that she will be able to get more income; thus, take her children to school. Also she will be able to feed her children well.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jepkosgei owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, TV and DVD, but does not have solar power, running water or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository; thus, reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs

Comenta que adem\u00e1s de realizar los tejidos, tambi\u00e9n vende pizzas, para la venta de pizza se dedica desde los jueves hasta el domingo, y el resto de la semana a sus tejidos, ambos rubros los realiza en su casa, y su horario lo distribuye de acuerdo a su disponibilidad.\nLa mercader\u00eda e insumos que va necesitando los compra algunas veces en la ciudad de Santiago y en locales de ventas de lanas, y para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus pizzas en supermercados a bajo costo, por lo tanto conveniente econ\u00f3micamente.\nCon el cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 un regulador de gas, gal\u00f3n de gas, queso, harina, aceitunas, masas, aceite, cajas para pizza y lanas de diferentes colores.\nUna de las metas de Ana es tener un local para colocar una pizzer\u00eda en paralelo con los tejidos a crochet y asociarse con su hermana y sobrina, asi generar mayores ingresos y optar por una mejor calidad de vida.\nAna vive junto a su esposo, su madre y tres hijos de 8 y 7(gemelos)a\u00f1os de edad. Sus sue\u00f1os a nivel personal y familiar es tener su casa propia para darles un buen pasar a sus hijos, y a nivel laboral crecer como microempresaria.\nElla est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida de la oportunidad que le ha brindado Fondo Esperanza, ya que le ha permitido invertir en su negocio.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \"Nuevos Frutos\" (New Fruits). It is composed of 17 entrepreneurs who work in different areas, among which are weaving, pedicures, greenhouse, mechanic, clothing sales, bazaar, internet , selling coveralls, and services, among others. All of them are from the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nAna, a member of this communal bank group, is standing in the first row of the photo, in the third place going from left to right. She is wearing a black jacket and a light-colored scarf. Her hair is brown, short, and loose. She has been working in handicrafts and has been crocheting (this is the art of creating through repeated interlacing of one or various fibers, using a needle with the form of a hook) for 10 years. She comments that in addition to doing crocheting, she also sells pizzas. She works from Thursday through Sunday selling pizza, and the rest of the week she works at her crocheting. She does all her work at home, and she distributes her work schedule according to her availability.\r\n\r\nSometimes she buys the merchandise and supplies that she needs in the city of Santiago and in places where they sell wool, and for preparing her pizzas, she buys in low-cost supermarkets, which are therefore economically convenient. With the loan she will buy a gas regulator, a gallon of gas, cheese, flour, olives, dough, oil, pizza boxes, and wool of different colors. \r\n\r\nOne of Ana's goals is to have a place to set up a pizzeria in parallel with her crocheting and to join up with her sister and her niece, to thus generate greater income and opt for a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nAna lives with her husband, her mother, and her three children, ages 8 and 7 (twins). Her dreams at a personal and family level are to have her own house and give a good standard of living to her children, and at a business level, to grow as a microentrepreneur.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her, since it has allowed her to invest in her business. In addition, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs in her communal bank group, since they share various activities and interests. From the training offered at the meetings, she has learned to manage her business better.\r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central part of the country. It is an administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley. With regard to Talca, there is a curious reference in Chile, the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London.\" Among the myths regarding the phrase, some say that it is derived from the original saying by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca resembles London), because of the abundant clouds that frequently cover the city in the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1219206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

His primary source of income comes from his personal farming business where he produces eggs, tea and other crops. He has four children and has been doing this work for 23 years. What he enjoys most about farming is growing kale, maize, peas, flowers and tea. His biggest challenge is not having enough seeds and fertilizer for planting season. \r\n\r\nWith this loan he wants to buy his first dairy cow. Joseph chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan in order to get financial assistance to help him expand his farming. During Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Joseph said that he learned that microfinance can help a farmer buy an asset that will help expand his farming. Joseph believes that the loan will benefit his family because it will give him a means to provide for his family's needs. His highest monthly expense is school fees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Joseph owns poultry and a bicycle, but does not own a cow, pig, pump, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards that may come from a loan. This borrower has running water in his home, but does not have a mosquito net, electricity, solar power, a sewing machine, TV, or DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1216278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To
