Her primary sources of income are milk, crops, and a salary job. She has three children and has been doing this work for ten years. \r\n\r\nHer favourite part of farming is poultry. She loves poultry and enjoys feeding them! Her biggest challenge is disease that can lead to the death of a large amount of birds. Animals on the farm have been given the names 'Tina.' She will use the loan to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nMonicah chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan after she got information from other existing clients. After Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Monicah said she learned about how to invest in farming and increase her income.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Monica said that she will get more income which she will use to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Monica owns a cow, poultry, pump, and automobile but does not own a pig, bicycle, or motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards that may come from a loan.

He applied for a loan of three million shillings, but only one million five hundred thousand shillings was approved.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to put a roof on his house, which is currently under construction. He will also use part of it for his fish vending business. Moses buys fish from fish mongers who operate in the nearby bodies of water. He then sells them to markets and individuals. Moses has done this business for the last three years and has been able to purchase a plot of land on which he is constructing a house.

She has been in the business of glove making for five years. The boy shown in the photo is Sajida\u2019s son, who also assists her in this activity of glove stitching. Five years ago Kashf team members approached a family of 10 subsisting on a very low income per month. The bread winner of the family was employed as a daily wage laborer at a cloth factory that was known to be exploiting its workers. The family was suffering from major financial challenges when Sajida, who was then a housewife, decided to take her first loan. She used this money to purchase material that was required to stitch gloves.\r\n\r\nDesperate to support her children who were growing up without going to school, Sajida took her gloves to the market and sold them at a minimal price. Buyers liked her gloves and demanded more. While talking to the Kashf team recently she was delighted to share her business experience and how she has been able to financially progress because of a healthy relationship with Kashf. She said she worried because unlike many other children in her neighborhood her sons and daughters were unable to attend school. Now, as her business is growing and she is able to establish a stable clientele, her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nShe is been in association with Kashf for five years. She has shown excellent repayment behavior. At present, she has requested a loan of 45,000 PKR to buy winter fabric and leather in large quantities to meet with the increasing demand. She hopes to earn large profits due to the increase in sales during the winter season. She dreams of building her own house and wishes to spend part of the income on the betterment of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1216776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy winter fabric and leather in large quantity to meet with the increasing demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Sialkot","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T08:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T08:50:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sajida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3185},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3278},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3374},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3472},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3574},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3678},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3786},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3896},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4010},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4127},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4248},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4372}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":3185,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3208.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323033834},{"amount":34.6,"local_amount":3278,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3302.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331169982},{"amount":35.62,"local_amount":3374,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3399.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339552725},{"amount":36.64,"local_amount":3472,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3498.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347102591},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":3574,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3600.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355847749},{"amount":38.82,"local_amount":3678,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3705.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556443},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":3786,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3814.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372954942},{"amount":218,"local_amount":20653,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":20808.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390821816}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T14:11:59Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":484397,"name":"Barzan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barzan is a 31-year-old, hardworking, young Iraqi man.

She has one son and one daughter. She is a member of a group called Janlai Lengnu; its literal meaning is 'queen of the night'. Most of its members reside in and around Saikul and are doing small business at the Saikul bazaar. Saikul is a small town in Manipur, one of the seven sister states in the northeastern part of India.\r\n \r\nPreviously Pi.Neilam ran a small tea stall at Saikul bazaar all by herself but found it not so profitable, as there are a good number of tea stalls in the area. She wanted to venture into the garment business as there is scope to make good business but she didn\u2019t have enough money to start with. She, along with other members of Janlai Lengnu group, approached the WSDS branch office at Saikul and sought a loan. After all the formalities, each member received a loan of INR 5000.\r\n\r\n With the loan amount plus some of her own money, Pi.Neilam went to Moreh, a small town near the Myanmar border well known for its foreign goods, and purchased garments wholesale to be resold at Saikul bazaar. Clothes seen hanging behind the group picture is the one showcase for selling by Pi.Neilam. She sells ladies' clothes, men\u2019s wear like T-shirts, jean pants and clothing for children.  \r\n\r\nWith the approach of festivals like Diwali, Durga Puja and Christmas she is desperately in need of money to add garments in her stall. She is asking for loan of INR 10,000 for her business. With the profits earned she plans to enroll her children in a better

With good relationships in the family, Merlita is really inspired to pursue the business she started because she wants to finance her youngest daughter's college education. They live in Ilagan municipality. Merlita shared also that the village where they live is a faraway rural place and mountainous.\n\nMerlita wants to request a loan of PHP 40,000 that will be very helpful to her new rice vending business.

Villagers of L.Hengjang have practically no access to financial assistance, not even in the form of loans. Due to poverty and shortage of capital money, they are not able to take up income-generating activity.\r\n\r\nLhingneichong and her husband are a hardworking couple who have three school-going children. Though her husband works as a carpenter, his income is inadequate to meet their day-to-day household needs and the children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\t\r\nIn 2009 Lhingneichong learned about WSDS disbursing loans to women's groups in the neighboring locality. To avail herself of this opportunity, she, along with four other women of the village, formed Sarah group and underwent compulsory group training conducted by WSDS. On completion of the training, Lhingneichong and other members of the group received INR 5,000 each as loans. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she bought two piglets and with the remaining amount she built pig sty. Feeding her pigs involves a good amount of hard labor. She walks down to Leimakhong (market place), which is about 2 kms, to collect feed for her pigs. During day time she works in her small agricultural land where she cultivates potatoes, cabbages and many other vegetables for her household consumption and sale in the market. \r\n\r\nNow she wants to avail herself of another loan of INR 10,000 to purchase four or five piglets depending on the price. And by next year with the amount she gets from the sale of these pigs, she wishes to start a small general shop in the village. She is hopeful that with God\u2019s grace her cherished dream of having her own general store and providing proper education to her children will surely come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1216811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase four or five piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkholam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T12:56:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":486018,"name":"Oscar Mauricio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar Mauricio de veintinueve a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su familia, \u00e9l se dedica a la crianza de cerdos y vacas adicional a esto se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz, tiene varios  de trabajar en la agricultura y eso le ha regalado mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas, el terreno de  cultivo tiene gran potencial agr\u00edcola, todo lo que comercia lo vende en los alrededores de la comunidad donde vive y ya tiene mucha clientela que lo prefiere por la calidad, los buenos precios y sobre todo con un servicio inigualable; Oscar es un hombre emprendedor, luchador y muy humilde, todos los d\u00edas se dedica al m\u00e1ximo a su trabajo porque sabe que asi alcanzara el \u00e9xito que tanto desea, en la ultima temporada de siembra tuvo algunas perdidas y quiere recuperarse, necesita de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un credito que le permita comprar ganado, semilla de ma\u00edz, insecticida etc. Oscar Mauricio tiene buenas referencias de pago, y es muy responsable asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez conf\u00eda que llevara a su hogar seguridad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"Oscar Mauricio, 29, lives with his family.

She services the store alone and when there is a holiday she contracts an assistance, paying them hourly wages. In her shop she offers blouses, shirts, t-shirts, jeans, and sweats and that is what most customers request.

He is planning to buy water pumps to start agricultural irrigating programs in the future that will expand his working zone."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1216880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"To buy a vehicle necessary for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Jib Jennine","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-10-19T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-18T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hasan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918501},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440496},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993186},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735795},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441181},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846417},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614646},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472153},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728257},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997195},{"amount":87,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419761818}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T04:09:03Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T10:08:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyle Setzer","image":244339}},{"id":484557,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Micheal is twenty-nine years old.

Her business is located at a residential area, and her primary customers are residents. \r\n\r\nShe describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient materials for making clothes to sell.

Nuriddin does not want to rely on his parent's savings to provide for his education but feels that it is his responsibility to finance his education independently. This year Nuriddin was admitted to the university and, after consulting with his parents, deiced to turn to Arvand for a loan.

He is married and has six children. His wife is raising the kids and taking care of the household. When Iskhok took out his first KIVA loan his herd contained 20 cows. He expanded his business and now his herd has 38 cows. Iskhok has been raising animals all his life, since he has no education and this is the sole source of income for his family. His sons help their father take care of the animals. Iskhok knows all the tricks of the trade and has never broken a loan agreements. He would like to use the current loan to purchase a few more animals for his herd.

middle-aged woman who is an English teacher by profession. She works in a local school and has many years of experience. Her husband is a licensed doctor who practices in a local hospital. Because workers who are paid from the public purse receive small salaries that barely cover living expenses, those residents living in rural areas also raise cattle. Qambaroi and her husband have kept cattle at home for more than 20 years. This is a very opportune situation for the family at this time, since Qambaroi's son and daughter-in-law have gone to Russia to earn money to help their parents, just as many of their peers do. However, Qambaroi tries not to use their money, saving it to build a house instead. Now she has found out about MDO Arvand and has come for financial assistance to buy several more head of cattle to increase her herd. Qambaroi is hoping to earn a good income and to co-operate with us for a long time.

esta actividad porque quer\u00eda ayudar a sus hijos ya que  tiene 2 ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os a quienes cuida por eso  no puede trabajar en una empresa. El trabajo es independiente y en la investigaci\u00f3n que realizo le pareci\u00f3 rentable, empez\u00f3 vendiendo bajo el c\u00f3digo de otra persona pero esto no le ayudaba ya que quien ganaba las promociones por vol\u00famenes de venta era su amiga. Cuando pudo reunir dinero para capitalizarse se acerco a la empresa y se registro con su propio c\u00f3digo. El  trabajo  lo realiza sola haciendo recorridos y visitando a sus clientes ya sea para cobrar o entregar y recoger pedidos. Su horario normalmente es desde las 9:00 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 11:00 y luego sale a las 15:00 hasta las 17:00 realiza este intervalo porque regresa a casa para atender a sus hijos. Martha vende productos como perfumes, maquillaje, l\u00e1pices labiales etc., los cuales compra teniendo un margen del 30% en sus ventas. Vive en Duran y es divorciada. Con el pr\u00e9stamo va a comprar productos como perfumes, maquillaje, ropa y calzado para la venta esperada obtener mejores resultados.

She chose this activity because she wanted to help her children since she has two little ones she cares for and which is why she is unable to work in a firm.  The work\u2019s independent and the research she did made her feel it was profitable so she started selling under another person\u2019s code but this wasn\u2019t very helpful for her because the person who won the rewards for volume sales was her girlfriend.  When she was able to gather together money to capitalize herself she approached the firm and registered with her own code number.\r\n\r\nShe works alone on her routes visiting customers either to collect payment or to take orders.  Her normal schedule is 9 to 11 in the morning and then again from 3pm-5pm.  She takes this break in order to be return home to care for her children.  Martha sells such things as perfume, make-up, lipstick, etc. that she buys; her profit margin is 30%.  \r\n\r\nShe lives in Duran and is divorced.  She will use the loan to buy products like perfume, make-up, clothes and shoes to sell hoping to obtain better results.  In future she wants to open a better situated business to help more with household

Her children are not living in the area at the moment, as they are attending higher education courses thanks to the support provided by herself and her husband. Dina lives with Cayo, her husband, in a wooden house. She engages in growing cocoa in the plots of land she inherited form her parents 30 years ago. Cayo, who has the situation always under control, supports her with everything that is needed, as he knows that team works will repay them both better in the end.\r\nNow that the harvest season is over, Dina needs to provide full maintenance to her plots of land to protect them form a disease called \u201cSeca-Seca\u201d, and it can be a very devastating blight if not sopped with the proper means. For this reason she sees herself obliged to substitute some cocoa plantations on a vast scale, and she plans on hiring daily laborers who will carry out this job as well as give the respective manure to the cocoa trees, thus optimizing the production.\r\nWhile she works she always thinks about her children, to whom she offers all the economic support they need in hope to see them completing their professional studies and becoming economic independent in the future. This is her third loan with MFP, and she is grateful to the institution for trusting her. She commits to always complying with the repayment of her dues, as she has always greatly benefited from the other loans she has received. She also says that she likes being a member of her Communal Bank because she feels more confident and she gets more information on receiving benefits when staying in a group.\r\nThe 2,500 PER she is requesting will be used to hire daily laborer to extract the infected trees and to buy nursery trees to replace the infected one, as well as to buy manure to grant herself an adequate production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1218265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy nursery plants, manure and to pay for daily labors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-20T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-19T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":267.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":291.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":301.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":297.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":321.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":331.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":336.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":351.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.5,"local_amount":267.96,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":270.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053677},{"amount":113.79,"local_amount":291.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":294.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188614},{"amount":117.53,"local_amount":301.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572526},{"amount":116.03,"local_amount":297.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":300.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122186},{"amount":125.22,"local_amount":321.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":323.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868012},{"amount":129.34,"local_amount":331.63,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":334.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576871},{"amount":131.33,"local_amount":336.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":339.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529209},{"amount":137.26,"local_amount":351.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":355.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974353}],"funded_date":"2012-10-21T12:30:19Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":484791,"name":"Joel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joel is married with 3 children.

Shortly after they moved out on their own, they started leasing a wooden house.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of his father, he was able to purchase his own parcel of land.  Since he is a hardworking young man, for the past two years he has been making a living through agriculture - specifically the production of coffee and cocoa - due to its high demand.  Luz, who is a great support to him, is constantly helping him with basic tasks, and they have been a united team in the face of the hard work of the countryside.  He clearly appreciates her very much.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing his land, he was surprised to find that there are a number of cocoa trees at the end of their lifecycle, and it is now necessary to replant the land so that the space is not wasted and the land capacity is maximized.  For this reason, he needs to buy seedlings in bulk quantities, as well as grafts.  Among his skills, he learned to make his own organic fertilizer made of plants and fertile soil, which he is also thinking of selling in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan that will allow him to work with more confidence.

Then, with the help of her sisters, they began selling humitas (flavored corn paste wrapped in corn husks), rolls, and snacks.
