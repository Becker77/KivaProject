She is a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other items needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes her business grows and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business . She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1217611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for cloth, thread, fabric and other materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-20T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-19T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3311.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351025},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2207.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960134},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2208.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094848},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":551.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484003}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T14:23:03Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":484929,"name":"Anthony","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At 34 years old, Anthony is a commercial farmer.

She says that everything she has accomplished is for her daughter.\r\n\r\nThis young household is located in a house made of wood.  Upon starting a life with Edgar, she joined the work that he has been doing in the field for ten years.  Her main business activity is producing cacao and coffee.  This way, together, they have strengthened a team that is moving towards progress.\r\n\r\nThe work has always caught her attention for being a collective job with good income due to the demand.  Nevertheless, they were affected by the prices that were set at the collection sites.\r\n\r\nAlongside this work, she is planning on starting to grow timber trees.  This is because she feels that, in the future, it would be a good way to continue getting the maximum advantage of the land in a responsible way.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest season she needs to do the appropriate weeding.  The weeds develop at a dizzying pace around her cacao trees.

She is married to a businessman. She has five children, aged between 6 and 19.  All of her children attend schools. She has been a maize farmer for 15 years. She wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs. The profits from the business will be used to beautify, clean, and create a friendly environment at her home.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is married to Ferdinand, a painter, and mother to her child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She makes a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennie hopes to give her child a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is married with three children, they all attend schools. He has been a maize farmer for 18 years. He wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs. He plans to use the profits to make savings and pay school fees for the children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

However, a year ago, Svetlana divorced her husband because of his infidelity, and he took the store from her. \r\n\r\nSvetlana has now started over. She is renting new premises and sells electronics independently. She wants to stock her shop with goods in order to meet the demands of her customers. She is hard-working and has set herself big goals. Svetlana is asking for a loan of 22,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia to buy notebook computers and telephones. She will use the income generated to increase the range of goods she sells and to improve her sales outlet.

","en":"Maria, 56 years old, has a business in the center of the city of Barranquilla in a predominantly commercial area.  In her store she sells sport and casual lines of shoes for women, men and children.  The business was born 35 years ago when, over a period of 22 years, she traveled to Maicao, a city on the border of the country, to buy varied merchandise that she distributed among the merchants in market stalls.  When she acquired good experience with her own effort, she bought a market stall and set up to sell in a fixed location, which is where she is currently located.  The main items that she offers are sandals, flip-flops and sports shoes that she sells for cash, from 8:30 in the morning until 6:00 in the afternoon.  Her customers are passersby and informal merchants of the area that buy from her on credit and with cash.  \r\n\r\nThe high peaks of sales in her business occur during the second half of the year, especially in the final quarter.  It is precisely in this period that her working capital becomes insufficient to respond to the high demand that her products have in her business.

Her principal satisfaction is selling merchandise with special discounts to her customers. Because there are many offers that arrive in her magazine, and even though she places her orders, the working capital that she has is not sufficient to manage to invest in everything that this demand requires of her, in addition to investing in the other products that sell for cash, such as soft drinks, beverages, and snacks. This is the reason why she is turning to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy cosmetics, perfumes, women's accessories, snacks, soft drinks, and beverages, articles that have an important turnover in this second period of the year and with which she will impact her customers. For her business, she has a dream of making it prosper, with the goal of offering a quality education to her children. While she works with conscientiousness so that this can happen, she manages a 15-day turnover on accounts receivable and an average profitability on sales of 15%, indicators from which we project her business growth and we predict much success in her management."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1220867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, perfumes, women's accessories, snacks, soft drinks, and beverages to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71955},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73634},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75352},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":77111},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":78910},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80751},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82635},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84563},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86537},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.39,"local_amount":144700,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":146302.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994443},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":74521,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75346.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130789},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":76244,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":77088.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519645},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":78016,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":78879.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071488},{"amount":46.89,"local_amount":83364,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84287.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497702},{"amount":46.98,"local_amount":83503,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84427.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527516},{"amount":146.05,"local_amount":259652,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":262526.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928278}],"funded_date":"2012-11-04T15:45:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":485138,"name":"Al-Mha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maha is 39 years old, and married with six children.

She lives with her husband, with whom she has two children who are 17 and 9 years old. They all live together on part of her mother's property, where they built the house where they currently live. She and her husband work a lot since they want to get ahead and provide their children with a good education and diet. \r\n\r\nAsunci\u00f3n's work consists of the sale of clothing and linens. She sells various garments and various styles, colors, and models of bedding to the public. Her customers are basically her friends, family, and neighbors, along with new customers who always come on referrals. Sometimes, they order things from her in advance, which she distributes the same day that she receives her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe has already been working in this field for three years. She works alone because her husband is also doing his part to earn money for their household. What Asunci\u00f3n likes about her work is that she has time to do other things as well, which gives her financial independence and frees up her time to go to other areas and places where she can win more customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Asunci\u00f3n's sixth loan with MFP. She thanks all the people who make her loan possible so that she can continue doing her work with better results. In addition, she promises to once again make her loan payments punctually, as she did for the previous loans that she had.\r\n\r\nShe is also pleased to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people. With the amount requested (2,800 soles [PEN]), she will buy garments and linens from a wholesaler, since that's how she gets better prices and makes greater profits on her sales.

She has one child, and has been a farmer for 3 years.  Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops and personal business. She will use the loan to buy water pipes for irrigation.\r\n\r\nAsked what she enjoys most about farming, and Emily replies 'I am my own boss!'. She says that her biggest challenge is bad debtors. \r\n\r\nEmily was asked how she found out about Juhudi Kilimo, and she said that she heard about the organisation on the radio. She added that she learnt learnt a lot about farming and how to make money out of it during Juhudi's required microfinance training session.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is business related. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Emily replied that she will be able to educate her child.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

She is single and has one child aged 15 years. She has no additional dependents, but does have two sales assistants who are paid by month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Fudia established her food and drinks business. She began her business as her own means of getting revenue. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 Le (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 6,000,000.

She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past two years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her small business, where she sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a wider variety of clothes to sell, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and be able to pay school fees for her child. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is married to a farmer and they have two children aged 5 and 20. The oldest goes to school. Josephine is requesting a Kiva loan to buy more fertilizers and support labor costs. She plans to pay school fees for her oldest son.The photo was taken at the nearby banana plantation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is married and has two children, ages 13 and 9. In 1999, Kadiatu established her plastic wares, flasks and basket business. She began her business because she didn't want to be dependent on her husband anymore; instead, she wanted to be self-sufficient. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,700,000 a month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

She's the mother of a one-year-old son who's the fruit of her marriage to her husband.  She lives with them in her own house, which they managed to buy with hard work, helping each other.  They work every day to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nKatiuska's job is decorating children's parties.  She buys various dolls, decorative signs, fabric, and other accessories to create her work.  Sometimes she buys the materials herself to make everything, depending on what the customer wants, the reason for the party, and the age of the person being celebrated.\r\n\r\nShe works with the help of her sister or cousin.  Her customers come to her as referrals or because they're familiar with her work.  She has good taste for putting together attractive figures, and this is reflected in the entire environment she creates for the events she does.  She has been doing this work for a year and it's going very well for her.\r\n\r\nPreviously she sold clothing on credit, but the irresponsibility of her customers when it came time to pay put an end to her business.  It's going very well for her now.  What she likes about her job is the satisfaction she feels when she sees her customers happy about everything she can create, even in small spaces.  Also, it's a flexible job that allows her to take care of her young son.\r\n\r\nNow she wants to supply her business with fabric and chairs for the parties to offer better service and generate additional income by renting them.  This is her fourth loan with MFP.  She's grateful to the people who make her loan possible and give her the opportunity to continue working to achieve her objectives.  She's committed to the responsibility of making her payments punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan for 1200 soles [PEN] she'll buy cork dolls, decorations, balloons, silicone products, and other materials to use for decorating.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1220957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cork dolls, decorations, fabric, balloons, silicone products, and other materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katiuska ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":205.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":208.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.59,"local_amount":185.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":189.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447759},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":181.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053695},{"amount":78.38,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":202.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188632},{"amount":81.3,"local_amount":205.39,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":209.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572544},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":208.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":213.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122204},{"amount":87.13,"local_amount":220.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868030}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T14:18:13Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":485262,"name":"Fatna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatna is a 43-year-old mother of three.

In Israel, schools do not have cafeterias or school-run snack bars. Instead, outside businesses can sell snacks and other items to school children and teachers on breaks. In many villages, small kiosks are set up to meet this demand, and they provide popular food and drinks before classes and during the food break. \r\n\r\nFatna needed this loan to upgrade her snack bar and meet the demand from the students and teachers. With the loan proceeds, she was able to purchase a coffee machine, an iced drink refrigerator, a stove and additional materials for her snack bar.\r\n\r\nFatna has always worked in cash and is now reporting her income and continuing to grow.

active women of Bhawanipatna town of Kalahandi district in Odisha, India. Kalahandi district is known for drought and backwardness. K.Sarojini is one of the members of this group, standing in the middle with raised hand. She is a very energetic lady with advanced thinking. She is 35 years old and lives with her husband, one son of 18 years and one daughter of 20 years who are continuing their studies. Presently, K.Sarojini is residing in a small house with her family. \r\n\r\nK.Sarojini is running a 'Tiffin' business in two places of Bhawanipatna town with the help of two push carts, together with her husband for last 20 years. She prepares Tiffin items like 'dosa' and 'idli' which are very popular in the town. To help her in the business she has engaged two workers (one male and one female). She also takes contracts for supply of Tiffin at social functions. K.Sarojini earns a monthly income of 6000 INR. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan from Mahashakti Foundation and K.Sarojini wants to purchase a freezer and a grinding machine out of this loan. This will help her to store the residue of raw materials after the end of the day to be used in the next day and prepare fresh raw materials, thereby it will save the food product losses due to lack of a good preservation facility.\r\n\r\nK.Sarojini hopes to open a quality Tiffin hotel in the heart of the town and construct a 'pucca' house for her family. The other five members of the group are Sabitri, Banita, Bisakha, Kshiti and Urmila who are running a photocopy center, an electricals shop, a cloth store, a Tiffin hotel and a fast food centre.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1218053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing a freezer and a grinding machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bisakha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"K.sarojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":188000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":188000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T21:40:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":487129,"name":"Jenny Margot","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jenny tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene 4 hijos a su cargo.

as a career in 2008. As he struggled to uphold his business, he never gave up, continued to bid on jobs, and worked with what he learned to get his company to where he is now. \r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Stewart worked with rebar as he maintained side jobs in retail management, and in the last two years, he changed his career path to devote his time completely to construction. His company, Construction B&N Rebar Contractors, based out of his hometown of Hallsville, Texas, is a placement and tile company. Stewart said they place tile according to the contractors\u2019 aspect. General contractors provide the rebar and he and his team place it down for concrete. \r\n\r\nSince he is not a general contractor, Stewart has to bid on jobs and rebar, which he purchases, and then groups it by the ton. This allows him to charge an economical rate to his clients, which aids to winning more bids and obtaining more job projects for his seven employees. Depending on the size of the job, Stewart hires construction workers to assist on a particular project. Because of the large amount of projects he has, Stewart needed a loan to cover payroll expenses.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. through the Small Business Association in Longview, where he attended a couple of seminars, Stewart decided to apply for a loan to sustain his employees on the payroll roster instead of selling his business to make ends meet. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed with a pretty good job,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI know rebar, and I can help someone put some food on the table for their families.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1218105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

When she is not working in the streets, she is dedicated to selling in her house. Eventually, she complements this work selling clothes. All of the products that she puts on sale are obtained through catalog purchases or acquiring them at wholesale from commercial stores that provide quality products. She works alone and feels very comfortable doing so since it allows her to have time to be at her spouse's side and to not neglect her housework. She is doing very well due to the fact that she has good sales but wishes to expand her business extending a space in her house in which she wishes to sell a greater quantity of articles for which she will implement the necessary items where she can better exhibit her products.

She has lived for some time with the man she loves. They live in her parents' home but she has her own lot in the same neighborhood where she will build her own home. She is constantly helping out with the household finances and that is why every day she works hard to have a better quality of life. Liz's work now is renting out rooms. She has set up four rooms on her lot and she rents them out daily, weekly or monthly at comfortable prices. To build these rooms she had her father's and her husband's help. They support her unconditionally. She just started this activity a month ago. Previously she sold chickens, but the demand for the product went down and that is why she decided to switch to a different type of work. Now she is in the middle of outfitting some of the rooms and is painting them so they will look better. Despite this she already has potential renters who are waiting to use the rooms. She also has alittle bit of money saved up that she wants to invest in buying a motorcycle taxi that she will also rent out and thus have daily income to pay for household expenses. Both activities attracted her because she can receive good, daily income. She is happy because she can help to support her family. She hopes that her work goes well for her so she just can keep working. This is loan number 8 with MFP. She is grateful to the people who made access to this loan possible, since she will feel safer going ahead with her work. She is also committed to making her payments on time and feels calm and supported by the members of her communal bank. With the amount of 1200 soles that she has asked for, she will buy screens for the windows on the rooms she rents out. She will also buy a motorcycle taxi, adding to the 500 soles she has already saved up for that."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1220967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy screens for the windows in the rooms she rents, as well as a motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":205.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":208.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.59,"local_amount":185.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":189.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447761},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":181.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":185.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053697},{"amount":78.38,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":202.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188634},{"amount":81.3,"local_amount":205.39,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":209.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572546},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":208.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":213.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122206},{"amount":87.13,"local_amount":220.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868032}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T00:08:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":485380,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlyn, 33 years old, is a married entrepreneur of Catadman, Ozamis City with two children and is earning from her transport service business.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nArnel hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams that his children will finish their studies. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Single, he lives with his parents and help them manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLolito operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nLolito hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to have his own family.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1218418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3104.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351043},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3104.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960156},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4139.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094869},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4139.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484023},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036572}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T03:41:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:42:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Francine Abes","image":454244}},{"id":485419,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita is from Segatic Diot, Clarin.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nNovel hopes to expand the business soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1022604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She buys wholesale by the basket and sells by kilos. She has done this work for approximately 41 years, and says that with this work she was able to feed and provide education for her son. Now she works alone and continues doing so because it is the only means to generate income for her household. What she likes about her work is that she has time in the afternoons to be in her house and rest, since she considers working at her age unequal to when she was young. Additionally, she always was independent and is used to fending for herself.

She has over 8 years of experience, and using her natural inclination for sales taught herself how to run her business. Today she sells small home appliances, clothing, and health and beauty products using specialized guides or catalogues. Products are distributed on credit directly to the client, and her days begin around 2:00pm and last until 6:00pm as the rest of the day she tends to her home. Her goal is to have her own commercial space where she can exhibit her products and position herself well in the market, because her dream is to have her own home. \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy beauty and health products, clothing and small appliances, which are some of the items her clients order in pre-sales. She will buy these products in bulk with this loan, and the lower prices that she receives will be passed on, not only to her own profits, but also in the better prices that she offers to her clients. This is what will make her loan from Kiva a success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1221091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty and health products, clothes, and small appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T17:10:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T17:10:24Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johanna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74728},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74916},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76664},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78453},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80284},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82157},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84074},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86036},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88043},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90098},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92200},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92347}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.97,"local_amount":74728,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":77234.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994450},{"amount":43.08,"local_amount":74916,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77428.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130798},{"amount":44.08,"local_amount":76664,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79235.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519653},{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":78453,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":81084.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071497},{"amount":93.4,"local_amount":162441,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":167889.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527524},{"amount":38.35,"local_amount":66694,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68930.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928285},{"amount":58.93,"local_amount":102494,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":105931.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705443},{"amount":51.16,"local_amount":88965,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91948.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967741},{"amount":61.6,"local_amount":107138,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":110731.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323236},{"amount":96.32,"local_amount":167507,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":173125.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082504}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T22:14:17Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T10:03:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kaitlyn  Godfrey","image":null}},{"id":485448,"name":"Saleteisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saleteisa is a 56-year-old widow, with two children. \r\n\r\nShe would like to start growing taro and taamu to earn a living.

She learned her trade at a young age and follows in the footsteps of her parents and grandparents. Agriculture is now the main source of income of her family.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy ready-to-wear (RTW) products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMirasol hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has five years' experience in this trade. She was inspired to start her business when she started studying fashion design at university. She makes mainly dresses for women and girls. She designs the clothes herself, then cuts the cloth, sews the garment together and applies the finishing touches. Her customers buy directly from her workshop. She is very attentive to the needs of her customers, who come to her referred by previous ones. The time of the year where she sells the most clothes is during the last quarter, particularly the first two months of it. Her customers can pay outright or buy on credit. Leicy starts working at 8 in the morning and stops at 6 in the evening. If there are many orders, she might work until later. Her goal is to expand her workshop, which is why she asks for this loan, her first one through field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy supplies and raw materials such as cloth, thread, buttons, zippers, and other accessories. Her customers will be dressed to the nines for Christmas and New Year's Eve!

She dreams of continuing to design unique clothes, thus employing her creative skills in the service of the community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1221073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and raw materials for sewing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T18:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T18:10:08Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leici ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":143796.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130796},{"amount":40,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":71898.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071495},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":143796.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497709},{"amount":40,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":71898.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928283},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":143796.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705441},{"amount":80,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":143796.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816944}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T01:45:47Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":487201,"name":"Jorge Eliecer","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge  de 46 a\u00f1os ofrece servicios de mejoramiento de la imagen personal en su sala de bellezas, ubicada al sur de la ciudad donde vive con su familia.

He lives with his parents and his two brothers. They all live together in a rustic house of their own, built in an agricultural district. Hammer is an enthusiastic and hard-working young man. He has been helping his parents with the farm since he was fifteen. Now that his parents have gifted him with two parcels, he can grow whatever produce he considers to be most profitable, such as potatoes, peas, and sweetcorn. He also grows produce in other fields, which he rents. \"I usually sow around 40 sacks of potato seeds and 4 sacks of pea seeds a year', he tells us. His harvest is always plentiful and he manages to sell his produce at a good price at the wholesale market of Tarma. The buyers then sell the merchandise in various cities of the country, such as Lima, Arequipa, Ica, and other cities of the coast. Two months ago, Hammer sowed twenty sacks of potato seeds and is hoping from some help from Kiva lenders in order to buy fertiliser and keep tending to his crops. This is his third loan with field partner MFP, and he promises to be punctual in his monthly repayments. He belongs to communal bank 'Siempre Juntos' ('Always Together'), with which he is very happy because of the support and solidarity shown by the members. He will use this loan to buy guano from poultry pens to use as organic fertiliser for his potato plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1221027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of guano to use as organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T19:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T19:00:32Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hammer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":159.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":173.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":186.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":193.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":194.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":214.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.84,"local_amount":167.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":172.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053708},{"amount":64.26,"local_amount":160.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":165.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188645},{"amount":71.72,"local_amount":179.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":185.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572556},{"amount":74.4,"local_amount":185.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":191.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122216},{"amount":77.17,"local_amount":192.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":199.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868042},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":194.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":200.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576881},{"amount":82.94,"local_amount":207.36,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":213.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529219},{"amount":84.95,"local_amount":212.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":219.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974363}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T14:29:43Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":485514,"name":"Simorina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simorina is 25 years old and she has a child that studies in primary school.

That's the way agriculture is.\"\r\n\r\nHer sales are immediate because buyers come from different parts of the country to get fresh products.  In time Margarita plans to buy a car so Jos\u00e9 can offer inter-province transportation service, which is profitable and convenient according to their friends.  For now, though, she says she'll put her effort into her different products.\r\n\r\nThis month she needs to spread organic fertilizer, so once again she's requesting your help.  This is her third loan with MFP.  She's happy to belong to a participatory communal bank.  She says she'll make her monthly payments punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 soles [PEN] she'll be able to get alfalfa seeds and five sacks of organic fertilizer to guarantee their growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1221013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy alfalfa seeds and organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T19:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T19:10:16Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":115.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":112.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":128.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":129.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":138.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":142.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":108.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":112.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053706},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":115.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":119.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188643},{"amount":44.98,"local_amount":112.45,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":116.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572554},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":124.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":127.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122214},{"amount":51.46,"local_amount":128.64,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":132.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868040},{"amount":51.81,"local_amount":129.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576879},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":138.27,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":142.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529217},{"amount":57.13,"local_amount":142.82,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":147.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974361}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T01:36:50Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":487221,"name":"Juan De Dios","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan, tiene la necesidad de invertir en su nuevo cultivo agricola, es por eso que est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de insumos como abono, insecticidas, pesticidas, y as\u00ed poder mejorar la produccion en el cultivo y al mismo tiempo asegurando la alimentacion para su familia.\nEl nos comenta que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le permiti\u00f3 crecer y tener todo lo necesario para trabajar, las condiciones en su familia han mejorado.\n\n","en":"Juan needs to invest in his new agricultural crop.
