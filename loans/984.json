Through this trade, which she started less than 2 years ago, she has managed to earn an income to sustain her little 4-year-old, who she hopes to see grow up to be a successful man and for whose account she makes certain to keep herself working all the time.  \r\n\r\nWhen she started the business, her recently separated husband gave her 1,000,000 pesos [COP] to start her enterprise. That's how she was able to invest in merchandise and sell it in her market niche, the domestic arena, which has expanded and gone very well. That's why she's enthusiastic about making her business grow more. This is why she's applying for a loan, her first from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Kiva field partner], which she will use to buy gold, silver, and metal jewelry, as well as casual clothing and footwear. These are the items that her customers order when she makes her monthly rounds and that she sells to them on credit. She is very cautious in selecting her clientele in order to keep up her capital stock and at the same time be able to meet their needs when they place an order.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1221124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy gold, silver, and metal jewelry, as well as casual clothing and footwear.

Siranush would like to expand her farm by purchasing more land, where she will be able to cultivate more vegetables and grow more fruit trees. Siranush also needs some means to purchase stakes for the grape orchard. Expansion of the farm means an increase in agricultural income, which is vital for Siranush to cover the costs of raising her family.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn dreams of improving her way of living and hopes to give a good quality education to her children through all her hard work on her business.

The family lives in its own home, which they built in a native community in the central forest. Remy is both a loving mother and a hard worker.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

His wife works as a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs during maize production. The profits from the business will be used to buy a tractor.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He lives in a village in the southern part of Kosovo. Based on family tradition, he works in the agricultural business. For quite some time, Faton had been able to own and maintain a cow, but he had to sell it for money for his family about a year ago. \r\n\r\nNow Faton is requesting a loan to buy a cow. With this new cow, he will be able to save the money that he would normally need to spend on milk and milk products for his family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to expand this into a farm and to buy a calf as well to sell dairy products. His goal is to secure a future for his children and provide them with a better education. \r\n\r\nFaton wants to thank all Kiva lenders for their support.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of bedsheets and pillowcases for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to increase production and dreams to be able to give all her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

two years, Rami has sold different types of groceries in his store. It has been a profitable project and his only source of income, but not enough to cover the costs.\r\nRami is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him purchase a needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request and buy such as rice, sugar, dairy products and canned food. The loan also would help him make improvements in the store's condition such as installing additional shelves. Taking this loan will increase sales and increase Rami's income, which will ensure him better living conditions.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n\r\n

He is a friendly man and above all, is hard-working.  He makes a living by manufacturing traditional clothing that the indigenous women of his region wear.  Together with his wife and children they help each other carry out this work, mainly using a tool called a loom where he places the thread in order to then make the garments.  He began this work seven years ago after working with other people who were making this product.  He saw that they maintained good prices in the markets and in this way made good profits and improved the financial situation of their family.\r\n\r\nAt this time of year he has seen that this clothing has greater demand, so in this way he wishes to invest more capital in his raw material.

His shop is located in his town where many customers from his community visit him to benefit from his beautiful items at fair prices. Ibrahim works very hard to maintain his family\u2019s finances at a good level.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profit from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \n\nJowelyn hopes to give her child a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

to Bogor Timur. He is single and his mother is only a housewife. Another interesting story about him is that he used to be Ruma\u2019s business partner before he decided to become Ruma\u2019s field officer in the Jakarta Branch. He has been working with Ruma for almost 1.5 years.\n\nAs a Ruma branch head, he feels that a motorcycle is needed to actually run the business, especially in controlling and monitoring the field. Previously as a Field Officer, the only thing he needed to take care of were his business partners. But now, with bigger power comes bigger responsibility. He needs to take care not only of Ruma\u2019s business partners, but also of the Field Officers who work in his branch. And a motorcycle will definitely help him to move around.\n\nRuma\u2019s Network Management Manager recommended him because Murodi needs a motorcycle to conquer the new area where Ruma\u2019s branch is established. And of course it will help his business partners to generate more income too so they can have a better livelihood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":944.27,"image":{"id":1215460,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2775,"youtubeId":"N76NIOztGPY","title":"Kiva

state of Manipur and village of Motbung, formed a collective group in order to work together on expanding their businesses.  \n\nOne member of this group is Pi Kholneikim, the one with her hand raised in the photo.  She is 30 years old and has one son and two daughters, who attend the village school.   The family's main source of income comes from Pi Kholneikim's sale of her livestock at the local market.  She has become very proficient at raising her farm animals, which are mostly pigs, chickens and ducks.  She also works in her homestead garden where she grows  cabbages, corn and potatoes to sell at the market.  Her harvest is able to provide food for her livestock and her whole family, as well.\n \nPi Kholneikim is requesting a loan of INR 10,000 in order to buy 4 more piglets, chickens and ducks to raise until full grown.  She dreams of expanding her business enough to raise piglets full-time and expand her piggery.  \n\nThe rest of the members of the group have learned from Pi Kholneikim's techniques and have started raising piglets themselves.  They also have businesses that support their families, weaving traditional garments, agriculture, and clothing sales. \n\nSimsahei Group requested a loan from WSDS which serves the women of very remote tribal areas  of Northeast India and provides business capital which they can't get elsewhere.     \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1216162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to raise & feed animals (4 more piglets, chickens and ducks) for wholesale and expand her piggery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-10-22T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-21T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengtinhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T18:57:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":484078,"name":"Sarah (B) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured is a 14-member women's group called Sarah-B in the village of Makokching in the hills of Northeastern India (state of Manipur).

She grasped the opportunity and became a member of Ruth Group. The same year, she received her first loan from WSDS of INR 5,000 and started selling meat at the local market. \n\nEarly morning she would travel to Sekmai, which is about 15 kms, boarding the local bus, and purchase meat from the butchers. On return, she would smoke part of the meat over a fire and sell it in the local market.

She finished high school a short time ago, and is single. She lives with her father Carlos in the village of Pedro Vicente Maldonado, in Pichincha province in Ecuador. \r\n\r\nSeveral places can be found to visit in this canton, such as rivers and forests. These are visited by numerous tourists who by attending the canton's fiestas can share in experiencing handicraft exhibits and markets where agricultural products are displayed, as well as livestock; animals which comprise the wealth of many inhabitants. These activities, along with commerce, have provided private enterprise with the opportunity to build hotels, inns, and various tourist services. \r\n\r\nHowever, the main activity of this village is farming and livestock-raising which each year allows the the economic performance index to rise, despite the lack of technology transfer to the area.  \r\n\r\nCarolina finished her high school studies, and because of a lack of financial resources was not able to go on to university. Therefore, a year ago, having scarcely left school, she decided to be self-sustaining through the raising of pigs for subsequent sale. \r\n\r\nShe invests spends nine hours each day in this work. She has learned by doing, and it has gone quite well. Now Carolina wants to buy more pigs so that she can expand her business to other neighboring areas, in order to earn greater income. \r\n\r\nThis is why she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to apply for a loan that will help her undertake this purchase. She was encouraged by the credit advisor who helped her in many areas of learning that she will apply in her business. \r\n\r\nThis young woman hopes one day to manage to have her own home, so that she can live with her father and perhaps her future family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1220314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

realizaci\u00f3n de sus propios largometrajes.\n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia:\n\nEl cine ha sido una de las mayores influencias en el desarrollo de mi vida. Desde peque\u00f1o me sent\u00eda atra\u00eddo por las pel\u00edculas de terror que mis padres me prohib\u00edan ver y que aun as\u00ed ve\u00eda Esa pasi\u00f3n se empez\u00f3 a convertir en un anhelo de no solo ser un fan\u00e1tico sino tambi\u00e9n un realizador de este tipo de piezas art\u00edsticas.

A pesar de que mi familia no pose\u00eda el apoyo econ\u00f3mico necesario para poder lograrlo, me esforc\u00e9 buscando convocatorias y becas que me ayudaran a lograr mi sue\u00f1o. \n\nEl siguiente paso fue convertirme en uno de los semilleros de talentos de Colfuturo, quienes en convenio con Proimagenes me han otorgado la oportunidad de acceder a varios beneficios para obtener el cr\u00e9dito beca que necesito para continuar mis estudios. Es en este momento decisivo de mi vida en que el apoyo de la fundaci\u00f3n KIVA seria totalmente fundamental para poder lograr mi sue\u00f1o. \n\nEl desarrollo de la creatividad y la implementaci\u00f3n de nuevas herramientas para forjar productos audiovisuales de calidad es algo que va evolucionando cada vez m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y una carrera profesional ya no es suficiente para mantenerse a la altura de realizadores audiovisuales de talla mundial. Es por eso que mi mayor deseo en este momento es poder realizar un programa de master en direcci\u00f3n cinematogr\u00e1fica en una de las mejores academias del gremio en el mundo. Esta oportunidad ampliar\u00eda mis horizontes como director y me permitir\u00e1 darle un punto de vista mas amplio a las producciones nacionales y porque no, ayudar en el proceso educativo de la nueva generaci\u00f3n de realizadores colombianos.\n","en":"Camilo, from Bogot\u00e1, is 25 years old and graduated from Polit\u00e9cnico Grancolombiano in film direction and production through financing provided by the government because of his academic excellence in high school and because his family couldn't afford the costs of his career. \r\n\r\nCamilo wants to expand his horizons and knowledge through a master's degree in film studies, but he requires the support of KIVA so he will comply with all the requirements to access to his scholarship-credit of Colfuturo Foundation. After finishing his studies, Camilo wants to return home and begin conducting his own films.\r\n\r\nHere is his story: Movies have been one of the major influences in my life. Since childhood, I was attracted to horror films that my parents forbade me to see, but which I still saw. This passion began to turn into a desire not only to be a fan but also a producer of this type of artistic pieces. That is how I decided to become an audiovisual producer. Although my family didn't have the financial support needed to achieve it, I strived to search official announcements and scholarships to help me to achieve my dream.\r\n\r\nThe creativity development and implementation of new tools to build quality audiovisual products is something that is evolving faster and faster and a professional career is not enough to keep up with world-class filmmakers. That's why my biggest wish right now is to pursue a master's program in film directing in one of the best schools of the industry in the world. This opportunity would expand my horizons as a director and would allow me to have a broader perspective to national productions and why not, also to help in the educational process of the new generation of Colombian filmmakers.

He lives in the company of Bertha, his wife of 20 years. Together they have 3 small children whom they care for in the house they inherited from their parents 20 years ago. From a young age he learned to farm and raise animals. From there he decided to study agriculture in a renowned university. His studies paid off, as  by the time he was 16 he started planting all varieties of root vegetables like a veteran, such as carrot and for flowering plants cauliflower, artichoke and broccoli which he specializes in. He sells his produce in the city market, but the activity that he likes most is the raising of guinea pigs, of which he has 500. His secret is the management of the females, which he separates according to age and relation. He says that every 3 months he increases the number of animals. The food for the guinea pigs is based on the same planting alfalfa, as it has a high nutritious value. His customers already know him and request him for trade or eating. His short term plan is to buy a male breeding guinea pig and 10 females to start to raise animals of a higher quality. This is his 18th loan with MFP. He has a good concept of the group loan, although on many occasions there have been difficulties that have strengthened the confidence in his association, such that today he renews his promise to continue being punctual with his payments. Jes\u00fas will invest the requested funds in the purchase of organic fertilizer to distribute among his crops.

This has allowed him to improve his income over the years. He works along with his wife and their work is a bond they share to this day.

She works as a vendor in the largest informal market in the city, usually selling sports boots. She has been renting a counter there for three years. Before entering this business, she was a seamstress. \r\nHer husband is a taxi driver, and his working days begin at six o\u2019clock in the morning, when he takes his wife and children to their schools and the market. Bum-Ayush told us that standing at the counter is hard work for a woman, especially in the winter, but it is more profitable than her previous job. Every month she needs to go to the closest border with China, about two days away by train, to buy goods. Her old house is in incredibly bad condition. Every winter, she must burn 10 tons of coal to stay warm, while other families use only 2-4 tons. Burning more coal burning releases more harmful gas and dust into the atmosphere. Bum-Ayush, like every mother, loves her children, so she is planning to thicken her house walls, using materials such as cement, bricks, and glass-wool insulation, in order to stop the heat loss through the walls. So, Bum-Ayush is requesting 5,000,000 MNT to thicken her house

Ever since he was born, he has lived with his mother Elena in a house she owns. He's a driven young man who recently completed his studies for a technical career in agronomy. Ever since then he has gotten four years' worth of experience in growing high quality corn on his own plots of land. He inherited these plots from his mother, whom he loves very much. Thanks to his knowledge he succeeded in earning good profits, and now he wishes to expand his knowledge through a college education, which is his goal. For that purpose he started a business providing carpentry and infrastructure building services for the public and private sectors. He earns very good profits in this business, and for that reason he's considering hiring professionals in order to increase his earnings and get more customers. However, he doesn't neglect what he loves most, which is agriculture. This is his third loan with MFP. This entire time he has proven to be punctual and responsible, and above all he enjoys being a member of his communal bank which is comprised of supportive people with an enterprising spirit.

She lives with her five children in a home which she inherited 15 years ago. As a farmer, she works with agriculture and livestock. She plants on her own agricultural lands, which take her an hour to get to by foot. After every harvest, she sells her produce in the city of Jauja. She also raises hens, guinea pigs, and cows, which she often sells. \"Through raising my animals I make a weekly income. This helps me to cover some costs,\" she says.

She lives in the city of Ica in the district of Santiago with her 6 children. Unfortunately, for various reasons, she has been separated from her husband for some years. Since then, she has put all her effort into bringing up her family. She is a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to succeed. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and because she needed to work, she was not able to take the Secretariat course that she wanted to, but she would very much liked to have done so. In her free time, she likes to watch the news and educational programs on tv and sometimes she cooks a delicious patasca stew to share with her family. \r\nWith much persistence and dedication, Ana was able to start her small business selling food. She sells breakfast, sandwiches, sodas, and other things. Every day, she starts work in the early hours of the morning and works for about 10 hours and believes that things are going well due to her good flavors, dedication, and the kind treatment that she offers to her customers.\r\nAna is very grateful to the Kiva lenders as, thanks to the help they have offered, she will be able to buy supplies such as flour, sugar, potatoes, drinks, packaging, and disposable table wares. In this way, Ana will secure the supplies that she needs to continue working and she hopes to increase her sales and grow her income. This will help her a lot so that, in the not too distant future, she can grow her business and build her house and so offer a better standard of living to her family.
