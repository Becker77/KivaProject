She will be incorporating the loan in her current revolving fund used to buy scrap materials.

He is married to Paz, a vendor and mother of his child. Together they manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJoey operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nJoey hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his child will be able to have good future through all his hard work on his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products and supplies to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarilou dreams to have her own house and lot and hopes to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1219508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional stock of supplies and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2750.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351065},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2749.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960187},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094899},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2750.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484052}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T15:15:31Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":486141,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Eugenia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a buying and selling of charcoal business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

A father of seven children, he lives in a traditional family in Noumousso, Kadiolo. He owns a shop where he has been selling various staples (cereals, sugar, oil, etc.) for nearly ten years. His experience has earned him a good reputation in his business. He receives orders for cereals such as rice. \r\n\r\nTo have the resources needed to meet customer demand, he joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso six years ago. All past loans were repaid without incident. \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow him to buy one ton of sugar, five 20-liter jugs of oil, and three packages of cookies. He buys his stock at the big market of Kadiolo on fair day. He conducts his sales at his shop for cash, on order, wholesale and at retail, to a clientele consisting of both men and women.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 80,000 FCFA. This profit will allow him to pay the loan interest and to cover most of his expenses, any remainder to be reinvested in his activity. He plans to buy two tons of concrete to finish the land improvements needed to build housing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1222417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various staples for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T14:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T14:00:32Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amidou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103115},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243380},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624959},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179858},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922659},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636203},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029755},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819344},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678251},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399923982}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T22:53:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":486146,"name":"Salai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salai is a 27-year-old married woman with four children.\r\n \r\nShe started a small plantation to grow taro, bananas and yams to earn a living.

For the last 20 years she has worked in sales.  Her business was born when she decided to give free reign to her independent spirit in order to earn income to cover her personal expenses.  In her business, she sells cosmetics, shoes, cologne, undergarments and clothes.  She distributes them on credit, but she purchases them with immediate payment.  \r\n\r\nDuring her work day, which starts at 8 in the morning and ends at 6 in the afternoon every day, she offers her customers products from specialized guide books or catalogs.  She attends to their needs and successfully makes negotiations which benefit them.  She is attentive to the discounts offered in the magazines in order to pass the benefits on to her customers, for whom she cares so much.  \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to open a general store to the public in order to capture the market surrounding her because a lot of people don\u2019t know that this type of business exists and a commercial location would resolve this situation.  She dreams that in the future her children will complete a quality education so that they have great potential to be successful and that is her most important motivation.  \r\n\r\nPresently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from the Foundation Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy creams, perfumes, hair products, clothes, shoes and accessories.  By investing her Kiva loan in this season of great commercial activity, her sales have a great probability of increasing, as happens every year-end and this is what will make her Kiva loan successful.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1221127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy body creams, perfume, personal hygiene products, footwear, cosmetics and feminine accessories.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T15:40:10Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nevis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130801},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519656},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071500},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497713},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527527},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928288},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705445},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967744},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":376664,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":389447.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816947}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T22:02:42Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mallie Al-Khafaji","image":712712}},{"id":487282,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mujer con \u00e9xitos y fracasos pero con la idea de mejorar su vida y la de su familia.

They reside in Noumousso, a popular district in the city of Kadiolo (located in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nSalimata has been running her business selling wax \"pagnes\" (colorful West African cloth) and basins for more than 20 years. She works from her family's home in Noumousso, where she is very sought out by her clients for the quality of the products she sells. In order to meet the ever-growing demand of her customers, Salimata has been a member of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the past nine years. Following many group loans, she is currently on her second individual loan cycle. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full. With this loan, Salimata intends to purchase 15 wax \"pagnes\" (colorful West African cloth) and one dozen basins from wholesalers.

Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cEstrellas\u201d (Stars) and it has 20 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of lines of work among which are vest sales, sewing, pastry making, clothes sales, barber shop, marmalade sales and services, among others.

It\u2019s the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region and the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a curious play on words in Chile about Talca: \u201cTalca, Par\u00eds y Londres.\u201d Among the myths concerning it, some say it\u2019s derived from something originally said by an Englishman: \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d because of the thick fog that frequently blankets the city in winter like in the United Kingdom \u2018s capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6550,"image":{"id":1222829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy towels, hair color, gloves, hair pins and scissors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T17:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T17:00:47Z","loan_amount":6550,"lender_count":222,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Paz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeorgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hernan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":3096752,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":427218},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":430020},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":435875},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":441809},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":447826},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":453923},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":460081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":903.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":909.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":921.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":934.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":947.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":960.1},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":973.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":903.62,"local_amount":427218,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-18T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":428268.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381061},{"amount":1831.47,"local_amount":865895,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":868024.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988211},{"amount":1881.68,"local_amount":889635,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":891823,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331124688},{"amount":1933.23,"local_amount":914004,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":916251.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515291}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T22:03:17Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:13:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":488778,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victoria, de 57 a\u00f1os, es una mujer sencilla.

She works every day shopping and walking the commercial streets of her town and through the farmers' markets of the city.  Thanks to her language abilities, she can communicate and gain more customers. \r\n\r\nThis business allows her to gain better earnings because it is very profitable, as she is able to sell more food in bulk in response to demand in her city.  After all her time of experience, she has learned the best techniques for sales.  She is now engaging in the sale of peeled garlic, because the purchase price is higher this time of year. This loan is her seventh with MFP, and in all this time she has proved to be punctual and responsible especially in regards to her association, which is made up of people with an entrepreneurial spirit and common interest.\r\n\r\nFlora will invest this money in buying more garlic crops for sale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1223492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Comprar m\u00e1s cosechas de ajos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":411.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":455.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":469.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":488.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":518.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":528.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":572.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.74},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.62,"local_amount":411.92,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":412.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053740},{"amount":176.54,"local_amount":455.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":456.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572588},{"amount":9.52,"local_amount":24.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":24.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353916},{"amount":44.33,"local_amount":114.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":114.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905820},{"amount":45.46,"local_amount":117.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-08T10:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":117.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778584},{"amount":1114.53,"local_amount":2876.2,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-06T09:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450599139}],"funded_date":"2012-10-30T05:40:44Z","paid_date":"2014-05-06T09:16:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":488776,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Su negocio ha ido creciendo y poco apoco ha logrado genera un mayor bienestar para su familia; en la actualidad est\u00e1 prepar\u00e1ndose para la etapa mas comercial del a\u00f1o, porque es justamente el \u00faltimo trimestre en el que sus ventas se incrementan, pero su capital de trabajo ante sus metas se torna insuficiente. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude aun credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 blusas, pantalones, ropa interior y art\u00edculos varios, para responder a los pedidos de sus clientes, producto de su preventa. Su sue\u00f1o es que mas adelante pueda ubicar una miscel\u00e1nea en su propia casa, donde pueda posicionarse ante su clientela y que sus hijos en un futuro accedan a niveles de educaci\u00f3n de calidad, porque esto es  lo que al final  la impulsa diariamente.","en":"Lizeth, 29, works in commerce selling via specialized catalogues to her customers located in her neighborhood.  She sells on credit and buys paying cash and sometimes gets credit from her suppliers.  The main products in her business are underwear and outerwear as well as kitchen items and accessories.\r\n\r\nLizeth started her business two years ago aiming at helping with family expenses and better provide for her two children\u2019s wellbeing; they are one and eleven years of age.  Up to then all expenses had been covered by her spouse.\r\n\r\nHer business has been growing little by little and has been generating improved wellbeing for her family.  She\u2019s currently preparing for the busiest time of the year because it\u2019s precisely the last trimester when sales increase but her working capital in face of her goals is insufficient.  This is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan to buy blouses, pants, underwear and various items to respond to customer orders that have been placed during her presale.  Her dream is that later on she will be able to set up a variety store at home to position herself before her customers and that her children in future can access levels of good quality education because this is what ultimately motivates her daily.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1223566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

For the past four years she has provided carport services on her husband's large plot of land. She charges for watching over the cars according to their size. On his part, her husband is also in this line of work, since the business requires permanent attention. Because of the quality service they provide, they have been gaining more new customers who come to their carport in order to keep their cars safe. In addition, she also sells mutton meat. She slaughters the animals herself for selling, which makes it more profitable. However, what she enjoys most is providing this carport service, because it allows her to run another business on the side, so that she can obtain better profits for her family's sake. Her wish is to improve her carport's conditions so she can provide higher quality services.

She lives with her husband, Edgar, and their four children who she cares for in her own house she bought four years ago.  Every morning she cleans the installations in her day-care center for children under the age of four to receive them and care for them.  She does many activities during the day because her greatest effort is centered on getting ahead and improving economically.\r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, who works in construction, she also provides transportation in the motor vehicle she has; they use it to transport local residents to outlying areas.  She earns extra money doing this that helps her cover daily household expenses.  Because of this she keeps it in good operating condition.  \u201cEvery time I need money I turn to my motor vehicle because the other activities have their own capital,\u201d she comments.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 5th MFP loan.

The ger is built on the ground and doesn\u2019t have a fundament (foundation), so in the winter it may be cold if they don\u2019t have additional furnishings. Because the frozen land can cause a chill from below the ger, Batdelger is requesting 1,500,000 MNT to make a foundation and buy a thick layer of wool felt for his ger.

Because of this she believes that the best way to counteract this is by purchasing products and non-perishable foodstuffs at wholesale in order to have a better reserve.  \r\n\r\nFor Edith, this is her 9th loan.  With it she feels confident and grateful to make her payments.  She also considers that work in her communal bank is more effective because it inspires confidence in her in all respects.

Little by little she started selling food: enchiladas, chicken tacos, meat, grilled chicken, etc.  This helped her generate income to help with the household expenses and to earn money for herself at the same time.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy fruit, rice, cheese, meat, chicken, and vegetables, which are some of the ingredients she uses to make the dishes and drinks she sells.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to have a large restaurant where her customers sit down to eat in greater comfort and enjoy the food with pleasure.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1223670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit, rice, cheese, meat, chicken, and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayda Patricia  \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":293.84,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.73,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048962},{"amount":37.79,"local_amount":37.01,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":37.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006115},{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":36.71,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":37.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339568891},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347118509},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":39.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531136},{"amount":72.29,"local_amount":70.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":72.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573083},{"amount":0.37,"local_amount":0.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":0.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901683},{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":35.66,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":36.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459145063}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T05:35:43Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:38:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":486307,"name":"Elnura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elnura is 27 years old, married, and has two children.

His biggest challenge is that he does not have enough working capital to grow rapidly and this is exactly the reason for asking for a Kiva loan, to buy beer and soft drinks in greater volume, getting ready for the season of festivals that is approaching, because usually his business sales increase and this makes him very happy.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1223703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beer and soft drinks in greater volume for his business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T23:50:06Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52938},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":59774},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":61168},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62596},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64056},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65551},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67080},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68645},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70247},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71886},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73564},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.78,"local_amount":52938,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":53613.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130810},{"amount":68.03,"local_amount":120942,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":122485.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527536},{"amount":35.21,"local_amount":62596,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63394.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705453},{"amount":36.03,"local_amount":64056,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":64873.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816953},{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":65551,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":66387.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082511},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":67080,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":67936.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430061942},{"amount":82.54,"local_amount":146735,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":148607.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732285},{"amount":120.65,"local_amount":220102,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-28T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":222911.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.16,"payment_id":450415519}],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T13:15:13Z","paid_date":"2014-02-28T09:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":488888,"name":"Ramona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She lives with her family, and together with her husband she puts forth great effort so that her humble household never goes without their daily bread.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they still have needs, things that they lack.  She is used to struggling to get out of poverty and make good her talent for business.  She has never given up because of life\u2019s adversities.  Her will to succeed is enormous.\r\n\r\nShe now sells spices in a well-known area of the country.  Every morning she sets out walking and going through the streets selling the different spices that there are.  She also has a small store in her house, where she sells the little that she did not manage to sell during the day.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to increase her sales, and that is why she approaches Integral to request a loan.  This way she will be able to sell spices that she currently does not have.  These include sesame, red pepper, guaco chili, annatto, garlic, laurel leaves, and black pepper, among others.\r\n\r\nShe hopes and trusts in God that she will soon be able to increase her sales.  This way she will have complete assurance that her children will lack for nothing in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1221076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

years old and has the will to move forward. She has set many good goals, and one of them is to distance herself from the social violence that her area is the victim of. To this end, she has looked for good alternatives, like selling cleaning supplies such as soaps, disinfectants, and bleach, among others. She works selling in the street and she has experience in sales which allows her to earn a good income. She has gained a lot of customers because people prefer her for the quality of her products, the good prices, and above all the excellent service. She is an enterprising woman who is dedicated to her work. She is determined and wants a more prosperous future. Every day she works to gain it. She is very happy and comfortable with her business.

She would like to invest in the purchase of canvases, oils, and brushes to continue her work.\r\n\r\nMishelle has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I intended to study ecology, but didn't pass the entrance exam. Not one for giving up, I prepared to present the exam again. My parents suggested I also apply to the Fine Arts School, for they recognized my talents. I realized they were right, and that I could reach a compromise \u2013 I could paint ecological themes. I believe expression is an exercise, while art is the artist's reflection. I seek to communicate my reality through my work and the beauty of human sentiment through colors.

Actualmente  la demanda de la construcci\u00f3n ha ido en aumento y requiere contar con mas instrumentos de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda que le permitan tener mayor fluidez en su trabajo. En adelante tiene pensado tambi\u00e9n organizar a varios j\u00f3venes y formar una asociaci\u00f3n que le permita trabajar en conjunto consolidando un grupo capaz de desempe\u00f1ar proyectos de mayor envergadura. Esta es su experiencia n\u00famero 06, como joven que es, esta dispuesto a cumplir con puntualidad los pagos , pues por su responsabilidad lidera su banco comunal y su gran capacidad de  liderazgo a pesar de su edad.

He currently lives in an adobe house that was given to him by his parents.  He learned the construction trade at an early age because his father taught him.  He is now a man who is in much demand because of his sense of responsibility and the confidence in the bricklaying work he has done for five years.\r\n\r\nIt greatly pleases him when he finishes his work as it should be done.  However, his greatest enemy was the weather.  On more than one occasion the rain ultimately ruined the work.  The current demand for construction has been increasing, and he needs to have more bricklaying tools that will allow him to do his work more smoothly.\r\n\r\nLater, he is thinking of also organizing various young people and forming an association that will allow him to work stronger, together in a group capable of doing projects with a greater expanse.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth experience.  Being the young man that he is, he is prepared to make the payments punctually.  Because of his responsibility, he takes the lead in his communal bank.  He has a great capacity for leadership in spite of his age.\r\n\r\nHe plans to use the 1,500 soles to buy bricklaying instruments like professional levels, plates, trowels, plumb lines, and other more modern instruments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1223738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

She is an independent and hard working woman.  Through her hard work, and thanks to help from her family and nephews (who currently live with her), she was able to build a wood-framed house.  And so she is able to dedicate most of her time to her small grocery store that she set up in her home seven years ago.  With the store located in home, she maximizes her earnings.  It makes Irene very happy to help her customers because she has made a lot of friends through her store.  Everyone likes her, even though she sometimes has to battle with some customers who take advantage of their friendship to request items on credit and take a long time to settle their accounts.  Lately, Irene has had expanding the store on her mind.  That way she would be able to meet her customers demands.  It would be good for her to sell vegetables, beef and chicken, but only for the time being because in the future she wants to change the structure of her business, to have it well stocked just how she wants it.

She has a three-year-old daughter, Halsy, and she and her partner, Yuri, work hard to give their little girl everything they were unable to have as youngsters.\r\n\r\nOne of the things they have accomplished is to build their own house, which cost them many years of hard work.  With several options in mind, and with the help of her partner, she decided to establish a soda fountain and sell fruit juice and pastry.  In a year's time she was able to attract many customers and became more motivated in her work and started selling sandwiches and sodas to large institutions who were attracted to her tasty products.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys the fact that she can serve many people through her work, because it is something she always wanted to do.  Therefore, she would like to expand in the future.\r\n\r\nSometimes when she receives large orders and does not have the immediate capital to buy ingredients (which are ordered only one day in advance), she runs the risk of losing the order, and these are the ones that generate the most income.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is grateful for the confidence shown in her.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time.  \r\n\r\nShe is also grateful to the members of her communal bank for how they welcomed her into the group.  With the 1,000 PEN loans she will be able to fill all the orders she receives at her soda fountain, and will be able to buy wholesale ingredients to make sandwiches and drinks, such as fruit, meat, sausage and sodas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fruit, meat, sausage and sodas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T07:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T07:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":120.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":128.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":129.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":136.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053756}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T03:13:08Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":486691,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda works hard to support her family.

Five years ago she was able to complete construction on her home with quality materials thanks to her parents, who feel very proud to have such a hardworking daughter. Acquiring the land made it possible to produce crops and provide for her family's well-being for the past five years. She started on her own with one of the products in highest demand, cocoa. Since then, thanks to the loans through Kiva partner MFP, she has been able to hire workers as well as purchase fertilizer, with which she started growing commercial-grade products, thus motivating her to expand her plantation. Now she wants more than anything to continue building upon that momentum, since one of her goals is to open a convenience store in her home to keep her parents busy. Among her priorities to start the planting season is to acquire some cocoa plants as well as organic fertilizer, which is indispensable in order to reach the necessary quality for the cocoa buyers. Her seventh loan means more than she can say, and she is always grateful for the opportunity to be a member of MFP, which allows her to work hard with more confidence. She also is very grateful to belong to her community bank since all of her fellow members are very optimistic. With the loan, she plans to purchase organic fertilizer and cocoa plants, as well as hire workers to rid her land of weeds to optimize production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1223825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cocoa plants and organic fertilizer, and hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":62.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.19,"local_amount":55.48,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":57.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053757},{"amount":21.91,"local_amount":54.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188689},{"amount":24.12,"local_amount":60.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":62.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572601},{"amount":24.92,"local_amount":62.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":64.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122260},{"amount":25.73,"local_amount":64.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":66.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868081},{"amount":25.9,"local_amount":64.75,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":66.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576919},{"amount":27.44,"local_amount":68.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529253},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":69.48,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974389}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T08:56:42Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":488926,"name":"Juan Misael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan, es un humilde comerciante el cual se dedica a vender leche, casado, padre de tres hijos los cuales viven independiente.
