She\u2019s married and has four adult children.  She lives in her own house with her children and grandchildren.  She works hard to earn income needed to improve her quality of life for her family\u2019s benefit.\r\n\r\nBelmira\u2019s main activity is selling fish.  She rises very early every day to head to her city\u2019s small fishing port to buy the best, fresh, good-size fish.  When she has all the fish, she separates them by species and size, determines a fair price and sets them up on a table she has in her market stand.  She\u2019s been in this business for more than 40 years and it\u2019s her only source of income.  She always works alone and works all morning.  She affirms that sometimes she feels like she\u2019s taken some step backwards because of the intense, suffocating morning heat.  However, she knows that she has to work to meet her needs.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s now considered the possibility of selling bananas because she insists that they are the best nutritional accompaniment for fish and also because her own customers are requesting said product.  To do so, she needs to have the necessary capital and get to work.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth MFP loan and she\u2019s very at ease because of the great support she\u2019s getting because she feels that she will provide family, economic and personal progress this way; she will emerge with more self-confidence.  \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support she\u2019s gotten from her group and for all the advice her advisor has provided.  This motivates her to continue striving to make all her installment payments punctually.\r\n\r\nThe requested 1,500 sol loan is to buy fish and several bunches of bananas.  Her daily investment can be up to 200 soles depending on market prices since the wholesale price of these products may vary.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1224686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T18:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T18:20:20Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":229.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":237.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":246.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":248.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":265.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":273.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":229.15,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":236.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447774},{"amount":95.08,"local_amount":237.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":245.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053759},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":246.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":254.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188691},{"amount":99.3,"local_amount":248.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":256.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572603},{"amount":106,"local_amount":265.01,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122262},{"amount":109.34,"local_amount":273.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":282.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868083}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T22:15:16Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":486834,"name":"Phuong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phuong is requesting a new loan to buy more clothes of better quality to restock her shop.

","en":"Adolat is a woman of 52 years. She is married and has two children. She is a teacher at the local school. She has been a client of our organization since 2009 and has not once violated the loan terms, and has shown herself from a very good side. \r\n\r\nAt the time of the previous loan, Adolat married away her eldest son. She hosted an event at the birth of her grandson. This next loan she wants to take for the upcoming wedding of her daughter.

mantenido sus costumbres en idioma, vestimenta y labores. A esta cultura pertenece Margarita, emprendedora como toda su gente, tiene 26 a\u00f1os es soltera, aprob\u00f3 la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y vive con sus padres. Viven juntos en la Parroquia San Rafael que se encuentra en el Cant\u00f3n Otavalo de la Provincia de Imbabura. Otavalo es una ciudad muy atractiva por la diversidad de su cultura por lo que es muy concurrida por turistas nacionales y extranjeros quienes en cada visita disfrutan de paisajes, fiestas coloridas y las costumbres de sus habitantes ind\u00edgenas y mestizos que provienen de legendarias historias y que han defendido su territorio desde siempre. Es un cant\u00f3n muy rico econ\u00f3micamente pues desde sus antecedentes ancestrales, fue considerado el centro de la industria artesanal y actualmente estos productos son cotizados en todo el mundo.  Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una industria que aporta a la econom\u00eda de esta ciudad, pues en la zona rural se pueden encontrar r\u00edos, lagos, cascadas, bosques que son muy visitados. Por la afluencia de turistas, comerciantes y habitantes de la ciudad, en el centro de la ciudad se puede encontrar gran variedad de negocios que tienen el objetivo brindar todos los servicios para quienes pasan por la ciudad, estos negocios var\u00edan entre hoteles, hostales, restaurantes, cafeter\u00edas, papeler\u00edas, tiendas de ropa, alquiler de computadores, internet, etc. \nMargarita, aprendi\u00f3 de sus abuelos y padres a elaborar esteras, ventiladores y varios productos elaborados con paja de forma artesanal. Lleva en este negocio 7 a\u00f1os y lo realiza de forma ambulante en el centro de la ciudad para llamar la atenci\u00f3n de turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de estos productos. Uno de sus sue\u00f1os es convertirse en una microempresaria de \u00e9xito y dar a conocer en todo el mundo estos bienes artesanales que forman parte importante de su cultura. Como primer paso Margarita quiere rentar un local en el que pueda ofrecer su mercader\u00eda y al mismo tiempo se dedique a la elaboraci\u00f3n de estas artesan\u00edas, para lo cual ha asumido la responsabilidad de solicitar un cr\u00e9dito en donde adem\u00e1s pueda aprender sobre la adecuada administraci\u00f3n de su negocio. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa cuyo objetivo es acabar con la pobreza en el pa\u00eds, brind\u00f3 el apoyo a Margarita y ella asegura que su estilo de vida mejorar\u00e1 con el incremento de ingresos por las ventas que realizar\u00e1 en su nuevo local. ","en":"Struggling to preserve their culture and identity, the Otavalo Indians have maintained their customary language, clothing, and crafts. Margarita belongs to this culture. Like the rest of her people, she is full of drive. She is 26 years old and single. She finished high school and lives with her parents in San Rafael parish, which is in Otavalo Canton, province of Imbabura. \r\n\r\nOtavalo is a very attractive city due to its diverse culture. It is highly visited by domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy the landscape, the colorful celebrations, and the traditions of its indigenous and mestizo peoples with legendary history and who have always defended their territory. The economy in this canton is very wealthy because even in its ancient past it was considered the center of the handycraft industry and currently these products are valued all over the world. Tourism is another industry that supports this city's economy, because in its rural areas you can find rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and forests that are highly visited. Because of the affluence of tourists, merchants, and townspeople, downtown you can find a great variety of businesses that seek to offer all kinds of services to anyone passing through the city: hotels, inns, restaurants, cafes, news stands, boutiques, Internet cafes and booths, etc. \r\n\r\nMargarita learned how to make mats, fans, and several items out of straw from her grandparents and parents, using traditional methods. She has been in this business for seven years and she works on the streets downtown in order to draw attention from domestic and foreign tourists. She invests at least eight hours a day in making and selling her products. One of her dreams is to become a successful microentrepreneur and show the whole world these traditional crafts which are an important part of her culture. As a first step, Margarita wants to rent a location where she can set up her merchandise for sale and at the same time make her crafts. In order to achieve this, she has taken on the responsibility of requesting a loan. She also wants to learn about how to adequately manage a business. \r\n\r\nFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, whose goal it is to erradicate poverty throughout the country, has offered Margarita support, and she assures that her living standards will improve thanks to the increased income she will obtain from sales made at her new shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1224744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

studying in school. She is engaged in the activity of selling dried and fresh fish in the market which is two kilometres away from her village. Her husband catches fish from the Chilika lake which is near their village (Chilika is a famous lake in Odisha known for its migratory birds). The demand for fish in the region is very high as it is consumed by most of the people. \r\n\r\nSurjymani makes dried fish by keeping the fish in sunlight until all water in them gets evaporated which preserves them for future use (like when fish are not available in the market, in the rainy season). Dried fish is also used as a supplement to fresh fish. \r\n\r\nSurjymani is requesting a loan to buy a cool storing box for keeping fish, a fishing net and other insecticides to prevent fish from decaying for her fishery business. She says that this will help her in strengthening the business and responding to client demand.\r\n\r\nThis group is made up of neighbours and friends who formed the group Narayani Self Help Group (SHG). The members of the group have selected Surjymani as their president. The lady standing in the middle wearing blue in the photo is Surjymani. The common goal of the group is to expand their business activity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1220525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for purchasing a storage box to keep fish and a fishing net.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balugaon, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":4550,"lender_count":163,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Surjymani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasoda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hajari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bharati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhunu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhunu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-28T03:28:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":486884,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is 51 years old and lives in Mobod, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cLos Perseverantes\u201d (The Persevering Ones) and it has 15 members who are in a variety of lines of work among which are grocery store, catalogue clothing sales, snack sales, towel sales, underwear sales, street merchants, home items sales and services, among others.

She comments that she works with a three-wheeled cart selling breakfast to her clientele.  She makes cakes, Bundt cakes, kneaded bread, sopaipillas, sandwiches, tea and coffee.  She works Monday through Friday from 6am until 10pm.  She buys supplies as needed in supermarkets and stores where she finds it at low cost which is convenient economically.  She will use the loan to buy flour, sugar, dried fruit, oil and sopaipilla dough.  One of Carmen\u2019s goals is to have a fixed locale and to grow into a micro businesswoman to generate higher income and have the possibility of better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCarmen lives with her husband who helps her sell the breakfasts and with her two children, a disabled 13-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.  Her dream at a work level is to have a locale where she can take care of all her customers and at the family level to give her children the best so that her son can continue with his Telethon [charitable rehab centers] training and her daughter can attend school.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has provided because it will allow her to invest in her business.  She comments that the training has been fundamental for her business and also for her personal development because she\u2019s learned how to organize and better distribute her income and investments.  She comments that there is very good communication in the communal bank she belongs to.\r\n\r\nQuilicura es a commune in the Santiago, Capital of Chile, located in the extreme northeast of the metropolitan region.

She does repairs like zipper replacement and basting and she makes dresses, sweatshirts and whatever else her customers request.  Her work schedule varies according to her availability.  She buys the supplies and merchandise she needs in stores that specialize in low-cost fabrics and sewing accessories which is economically advantageous.  She will use the loan to buy fabric, thread for the embroidery machine and for the overlock machine, buttons, zippers and needles.\r\n\r\nOne of Mercedes\u2019 goals is to be able to buy a special sewing machine (one that can use from one to three needles) and to replace her overlock machine with a newer one to generate more work and meet customer expectations thus generating higher income and providing better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nMercedes lives with her husband and 19-year-old daughter who is studying.

He works in agriculture and works hard to maintain his family.  He plants vegetables like carrots, potatoes, beets, cabbage and beans on a parcel that he rents a few kilometers from his home.  He learned this work from his parents many years ago, and it was his first job in life.  That's why he did not have the opportunity to attend school.  \r\n\r\nHe has now been working independently in this field for 15 years, but with his own capital.  This has not given him the opportunity to expand his crops, and thus he sees the need and decided for the first time to ask for a loan of 4,000 Quetzales (Guatemalan currency) in order to purchase potato seeds and organic fertilizers.  During this season the harvest is better.  With these funds he can cultivate more in other parcels and expand his crop.  His greatest dream is to cultivate a variety of vegetables since others exist that offer better prices in comparison to what he currently produces.  He also wants to be able to provide his children with better academic studies in the future.

Alexandrine Bernadette, who is responsible for the group, is 37 years old. She is married and mother to two children who attend school. The eldest is 12 years old and the youngest eight. A dressmaker by trade, she has had a workshop, where she makes up clothes, for several years and she gets her supplies in one of the surrounding markets.

A smoke, generated from the stoves, is polluting the atmosphere and threatening people\u2019s health and the environment. So Tsolmon is requesting 5,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to connect her house to the central heating system, which is located not far from her house. She told us that if people want to connect their house to the central heating system, they need to spend a lot of money and time to get a number of permissions from the city administration.

His house is located in the ger district, an area of city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. His wife has been working as a distributor in a merchandising company since 2011. Batzaya works as a driver for a local taxi service company which transports people from Darkhan to Ulaanbaatar, the capital. He has been leasing the car from his company. Every day, he has to pay $20 and drives 600 km. The car he is using has too big an engine so it uses 14 liters of gasoline\/petrol per 100 kilometers. The study showed that an average car running on gasoline emits 155g of carbon dioxide per km to the atmosphere. The gasoline contains ingredients like zinc and lead that are harmful to people\u2019s health and the environment. Economically, riding a car with a big engine in Mongolia is not rational, because Mongolia imports fuel products from its neighbors and its price always rises. So, Batzaya is asking 5,000,000 MNT to buy a car that runs on natural gas, which emits fewer harmful chemicals into the atmosphere than gasoline. On one hand, he will contribute his effort to save the environment, and on the other hand he will earn money for his

realized three of their members were named Maria, it seemed only fitting to name the group Las Marias de San Jose Chirijuyu (The Marias of San Jose).  \r\n\r\nRecently, we spoke to one of the Marias to gain insight into their Trust Bank. Maria, 48 years old, is married to a farmer and has nine children. She has farmed for many years along with her husband, Bernardo. Years ago, she was also a weaver, like many other women in her community. However, with her loans through Friendship Bridge, she has branched out and started a business selling vegetables and livestock in Guatemala City.\r\n\r\nMaria and her husband are skilled entrepreneurs. They keep money flowing in their local economy by buying crops from farmers in their village and then transporting the crops, along with their own strawberry harvest, to the wholesale market in Guatemala City. To begin this business they used a loan to build a storage facility to safely keep the products until they were transported.  \r\n\r\nRecently they have also started selling livestock.  A new loan would give Maria the opportunity to plant more strawberries and to buy chickens.\r\n\r\nMaria has many goals for her business, but most of all she wants to earn income to enhance her children\u2019s education. Her hard work is paying off as her oldest child is about to graduate from high school. Maria explains, \u201cI completed a few years of primary school, but my parents could no longer support my education so I started working. Now, with microloans that I invest in my business, I can earn enough to keep my children in school. I am so excited that one of my children will graduate this year!\u201d \r\n\r\nMaria and all of the Trust Bank members thank each individual through Kiva, for the effort made to invest in them, even without knowing them personally. Las Marias de San Jose Chiriju Trust Bank recognizes the responsibility that comes with great confidence like this.  \r\n\r\nAll eight women have created a circle of friendship and support. They are determined to stay together to enhance the lives of their families through Friendship Bridge\u2019s microloans and education.

They run businesses that revolve around agriculture and textiles in the lush village of San Jose Chirijuyu, Chimaltenango. This is a rural area in Guatemala full of agriculture fields, including the sweet crop of strawberries.\r\n\r\nWithin the group we find Rosa, who is 54 years old and married to a farmer. Rosa did not have the opportunity to attend school, but she and her husband make every effort to keep their four children in school so they can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s dream is that her children will go to college. Thanks to her hard work, they are well on their way as they have already graduated from high school! Like Rosa, the other members of the Trust Bank also are working hard for their children\u00b4s benefit. If they earn an income, their children can remain in school. The women who make up the Mujeres Las Estrellas Trust Bank have 28 children combined. They are excited about the positive impact on the community that their children will have if they all complete school!\r\n \r\nRosa is a determined businesswomen and, through the years, with loans and education from Friendship Bridge, she has grown her company to employ more than twenty artisans during the high season. Rosa is a weaver, like many women in Guatemala.  She needed a unique offering to bring to the market so she started designing and developing a different kind of weaving. The design has become very popular.  With the holiday season approaching, Rosa is proactively planning to ensure that she has enough products to meet the demands of this busy season. Rosa will invest this loan in purchasing the highest quality of yarn, allowing her to produce the fashion and color that her customers demand. \r\n\r\nTo sell the products, Rosa travels to four different cities that are located three to four hours away from her town. She has diversified her markets and now has exclusive clients to whom she sells her product on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nWhile Rosa is just one of the eight women who make up this Trust Bank, they are all just as determined. The women enjoy the monthly meetings in which a loan officer from Friendship Bridge delivers trainings and discussions about topics of interest, such as women's health, children\u2019s rights, business administration, budgeting, and much more.  It is a time for them to learn, laugh, and get support from the loan officer and their colleagues.  \r\n\r\nRosa, on behalf of the Trust Bank, thanks Friendship Bridge and Kiva for the opportunity to have access to microcredit and education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1218048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

Bank have little formal education but have high hopes and are willing to take advantage of opportunities for personal and professional development that Friendship Bridge provides. They all live in the small town of Patzun Chimaltenango, a few hours from Guatemala City.\r\n\r\nEach member of the Trust Bank has a business plan for their next loan. Maria Zenaida, 24 years old, has outlined a plan to enhance the products she sells in her community.\r\n\r\nLike many Guatemalan women, Maria only has a few years of formal education. She completed the third grade before her mother abandoned the family and her father needed her help on the farm and to take care of her younger siblings. While growing up, Maria\u2019s father taught her many lessons about agriculture. Today, Maria and her husband continue the family tradition of growing a variety of vegetables including cauliflower and broccoli.  They have four young children at home; the eldest has just completed the first grade.\r\n\r\nMaria married her husband at the age of 18. They were both working in agriculture so, together, they continued this practice. Years later, Maria, an enterprising woman, decided to expand their business into animal husbandry. Today, they own 25 chickens and two pigs. Through buying, raising and selling animals, Maria earns extra income for the family.  With a new loan she will invest in feed for her chickens, seeds for their farm, and laying hens so she can begin selling eggs.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dream is to continue to grow her businesses so she can support her expanding family. She is starting to plan for the future \u2013 she wants to transition the farm to her husband so she can open a clothing store and continue raising livestock. \r\n\r\nMaria and the entire Orquideas de Patzun Trust Bank appreciates the support of Kiva investors. Without microcredit, many family development opportunities would not exist in rural communities of Guatemala.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1218074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken food, seeds for farming, and laying hens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Patzun, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Xep ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy Melina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2577},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2561}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":331.51,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988620},{"amount":331.5,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331125068},{"amount":331.51,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515659},{"amount":331.51,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067543},{"amount":331.51,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355813603},{"amount":331.5,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364523693},{"amount":331.51,"local_amount":2577,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372924567},{"amount":329.45,"local_amount":2561,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2581.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381701742}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T23:02:30Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:11:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":487261,"name":"Claveles Rojas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Claveles Rojas (Red Carnations) Trust Bank is made up of seven industrious women from Patzun, Chimaltenango.

The Trust Bank is comprised of 11 amazing women who have been part of Friendship Bridge\u2019s Microcredit Plus program for five loan cycles. The Ukux Kem Trust Bank is aptly named as the women weave several products to sell including tablecloths, napkins, and traditional shirts.  \r\n\r\nHermelinda Josefina is a 23-year old woman and a member the Ukux Kem Trust Bank. Despite coming from a large family of ten siblings, she was able to attend high school, study secretarial skills and receive a diploma. Upon graduating, she searched tirelessly for a secretary position but with the economic crisis, she could not find one. Being single at the age of 23, she still needed an income to survive and help her parents care for the younger siblings. \r\n\r\nShe and her two brothers started a textile business, making cortes (traditional skirts) for several different cultures. Their products are so beautiful that they soon found a customer who consistently orders from them. It was clear their business was growing and they needed capital to keep up with supply.  Hermelinda found Friendship Bridge and the Ukux Kem Trust Bank.  \r\n\r\nWith her loan, Hermelinda will buy yarn in bulk and start working in orders for Christmas products. \u201cI am so grateful for this loan. My brothers and I have the desire to make our business bigger but it is not possible without money,\u201d explains Hermelinda.  \u201cOnce we earn extra profit, we will start to save to open a family bakery.\u201d\r\n \r\nHermelinda enjoys the monthly meetings with the Ukux Kem Trust Bank. The Trust Bank receives educational lessons from the loan officers on topics including women's health, self esteem, children's rights, business administration, customer service, and budgeting. This helps all the women manage their businesses and remain competitive in the market. The women would like to thank each and every one of the people who invest in them through KIVA.  \u201cWithout them,\u201d explains Hermelinda, \u201cthere would be no micro-credit opportunity for us, and business development would be very slow.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1221174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

Demberel\u2019s daughter studies at a lyceum. Her husband has been working as a contract worker in Korea for the last 6 years and every month he sends some money for his family. Demberel told us that she saves the money sent by her husband, to spend it for her daughter\u2019s education. And she always requires from her girl \u201cpaying attention only to studies and become educated person\u201d. \r\n\r\nIn Mongolia, the academic year begins in September and parents have to pay tuition fees for their children. To solve this problem, many herders sell their livestock wholesale, so the price of the meat decreases to its lowest point. Now each day in Mongolia is getting colder and colder, so the preservation of meat is not a problem. If Demberel buys meat in large quantity, she can sell it till March. The loan, she is taking will be used to raise her current assets and buy more meat. By doing this, she can earn more income for her family and for her daughter\u2019s education.

She explains that the house expansion work can be completed in a short period of time because she has gained a lot of experience from her current house and because she will not repeat any of her prior mistakes.
