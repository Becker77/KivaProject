a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nEbenezer is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nEbenezer comes from a humble background and is one of a family of nine. \n\nA true entrepreneur, Ebenezer has the ability to view challenges as opportunities for positive action. When his parents could no longer afford to pay school fees for him and his sister, Ebenezer initiated and ran a cake selling enterprise, and he was able to make enough money to pay for his and his sister\u2019s school fees. He also successfully started his own business, setting up a communications center where he acted as the administrator and oversaw photocopying, processing of photos, and typing. \u201cI believe in putting knowledge into action,\u201d says Ebenezer. \n\nEbenezer is also passionate about uplifting and motivating his community and was very involved in bringing people together for religious and educational programs. He organized many spiritual reunions and tutoring sessions with his peers and was nominated to become the president of a religious group at his school. He was also a leader for an AIDS campaign and the secretary for the student government at his school. He is very proud of African culture and believes that Africa should be modernized and developed but not without an emphasis on values.\n\nAcademically, Ebenezer is a high achiever. He recently came in 12th in his country in a math Olympiad contest.\nEbenezer is passionate about transforming the world by transforming Africa. His goal is to be a strategic adviser to African governments to help create high-growth strategies. He believes that transformative leadership comes from leading by example to inspire and influence others. \u201cLeaders must be self-aware and most importantly cognizant of the fact that they do not always have the answers,\u201d says Ebenezer. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ebenezer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748424},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735307},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614240},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629764},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668072},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159808}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T11:16:24Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489925,"name":"Carlos  Segundo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" CARLOS  SEGUNDO tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero no tiene hijos, vive con el pap\u00e1 en Ventanas provincia de los R\u00edos.\n\nEs Integrante de la VRC UNIDOS VENCEREMOS, se encuentra ubicada en el recinto la Am\u00e9rica, Perteneciente al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas, esta Ventanilla se dedica a labores Agr\u00edcolas de ciclo corto siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, fr\u00e9jol, gandul.\n\n CARLOS  SEGUNDO  se dedica  a la Agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, Solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar semillas, urea, insecticidas, abonos org\u00e1nicos, l\u00edquido mata maleza. \n\nCon la ayuda del cr\u00e9dito podr\u00e1 comprar los fertilizantes para la agricultura.

He is deeply concerned about the current number of Malawians who have to leave the country to seek specialized treatment and feels that as a Malawian specialist doctor, this is a problem he will be able to address. \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashraf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748425},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735308},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614241},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629765},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668073},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159809}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T11:39:51Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489314,"name":"Ghassane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ghassane is an 18-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nHe was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nGhassane is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nGhassane comes from Casablanca, Morocco, where he lives with his parents and two siblings.\n\nWith an insatiable quest for knowledge, Ghassane is passionate about reading.  \u201cWhat I am most passionate about is reading,\u201d he says. \u201cFor every book I read, for every story I finish, it is as though I am dreaming; the birth of another me who knows more than the old me; it is the greatest gift that the universe can offer humans,\u201d he explains. \n\nRecognizing the enormous benefit that a love of books can have on youth development, Ghassane decided to imbue his passion for reading onto his classmates and founded a reading club at school. The reading club allowed students to trade books with one another. Over and above the educational value of being a part of the reading club, Ghassane realized that the reading club provided a place of safety for certain students after school. \nGhassane has always been incredibly community oriented and is passionate about making a difference. \n\nIn response to the high rate of road deaths in Morocco, a new road code of conduct was released. Ghassane made it a personal mission to raise awareness about the code. With the help of his father, who is a driving school instructor, Ghassane designed flyers to explain the new laws and convinced his friends to help him distribute them in the city.\n\nGhassane is particularly sensitive towards others and displayed great courage when he decided to interview prostitutes in Morocco for a research assignment to investigate their reasons for being in the profession. Despite the fact that this topic was considered taboo, Ghassane recognised the importance of considering the perspectives of people from different walks of society and trying to understand what circumstances led them to select their profession, in the hope of someday being able to address the root cause of the problem.\nGhassane is also passionate about music which he says \u201cpermits the musician to share what is within them with the audience.\u201d\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ghassane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748426},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735309},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614242},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629766},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668074},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159810}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T01:18:13Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489926,"name":"Zoila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoila tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el municipio de Arizona, Atl\u00e1ntida junto a su conyugue y sus tres hijos.

Most recently, he was among the top 12 in the Molengoane Lodge National All Age Poetry Competition in 2012. \n\nMorema is compassionate and has held leadership positions and in his role, has supported his fellow students. For instance, when his high-school mathematics teacher suffered from a terminal illness only four months into the school year, there was not a replacement for the teacher\u2019s position until two weeks before the final examinations. Morema took the initiative to help lead the class discussions, so that other students would be able to learn all the required topics and not fall behind academically. \n\nMorema enjoys Science and was a researcher and presenter of \u2018Unlimited Science\u2019, an up-and-coming science television show in Lesotho. \n\nMorema says that he plans to impact Africa by decreasing the economic dependence on foreign aid.

pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, to identify, develop and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nShe was selected one of 100 ALA students out of a pool of over 3500 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nFatou is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to help her to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nFatou grew up in Dakar, Senegal as one of a family of 7. \n\nShe is passionate about physics, biology, medical research and medicine. Her passion for medicine arose when her brother was diagnosed with a sickness that was incurable in Senegal, and as such, had to be sent to France to seek treatment. This incident was instrumental in Fatou\u2019s decision to actively contribute to the health care sector of Senegal to ensure that all of its people have adequate access to health care. She is passionate about saving lives and finding medicines that will cure improve the living conditions of the sick. In the next 20 years, Fatou sees herself as one of the leaders that will impact the health care sector of the continent. In collaboration with other doctors and biologists, she hopes to advance the stare of research across the continent, provide access to medical services, find cures for epidemics and revalue traditional medicine using natural resources such as forests.\n\nFatou\u2019s innate leadership abilities were demonstrated consistently throughout her school career. Noticing the dwindling nature of her school\u2019s Arabic club, Fatou decided to revitalize the club by adding a debate as a new club activity. Through this change, Fatou was able to attract more members to the club. Fatou organised numerous school events in the capacity as member of the Arabic club. She was also the Communications Officer for the scientific club at her school.\n\nFatou has a track record of academic excellence and in particular, is a talented writer. As a testament to her excellent academics and writing skills, in Dakar, she was selected to represent her school in a writing competition about museums. \n\nAs a leader, Fatou emphasises the importance of surrounding oneself with competent peoples, and motivating those people towards a goal. On the issue of leadership, she says, \u201cSuccess is often perceived by men as a demonstration of their power, of what they are worth, but leadership qualities are not only demonstrated by success. The values of perseverance, confidence and determination surface mostly from our reactions to failure.\u201d\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou Camara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748431},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735314},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614247},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629771},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668079},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159815}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T23:00:50Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489935,"name":"Yesil Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Yesil Mar\u00eda trabaja para una escuela p\u00fablica en el municipio de Momotombo desde hace 7 a\u00f1os como profesora de primaria con lo que ha sacado adelante su familia quien la conforma ella y dos hijos, brind\u00e1ndole estudio, alimentaci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s necesidades b\u00e1sicas de un hogar siendo madre soltera.\n\nActualmente es su primer cr\u00e9dito que solicita a ceprodel  para mejorar su casa de habitaci\u00f3n con reparaci\u00f3n del techo de la cuarto con la compra de zinc, perlines, clavos y pago de mano de obra; para darles una mejor condici\u00f3n de vida a su hijo.\n","en":"Yesil Mar\u00eda has worked as an elementary school teacher at a public school in the municipality of Momotombo for the last 7 years.

objective when presented with divergent opinions. \u201cI work towards a common goal, preparing other leaders, fortifying the organization\u2019s capacity, and working with all for a common good,\u201d he says.\n\nOlivier tutored younger students in middle school for a math competition, which allowed him to pay for his school fees. \n\nHe was the prefect of art and culture in his

In all three holiday theater camps he has participated in, he always played the lead character. \n\nIn the future, he hopes to become an automobile engineer. His vision is to transform the transportation sector by creating a unique model of solar cars for Africa which will be environmentally friendly.

over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nLerato is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nLerato hails from rural Mpumalanga in South Africa, where both of her parents are farmers. She is one of four children. \n\nLerato believes she is a leader because she possesses strong leadership qualities: \u201chonesty, respect, real care for people and knowing how to care for herself and others.\u201d As the captain of the netball team at her school in Mpumalanga, she demonstrated leadership by \u201cbeing a listener, accommodating the opinions and strategies of her team members, motivating and lifting up her peers and being the type of person others are not afraid to talk to in any situation.\u201d She was also a youth leader at her local community center, where she taught computer usage and sports to young people.\n\nLerato is passionate about her studies and considers her academic achievements and performance as one of her key priorities. For this reason, she plans her time carefully working in advance to make sure she is well prepared for her exams. \n\nLerato has always felt it important to reach out to those less fortunate and \u201cstrives to help people living in poverty and to help those who are being discriminated against because of their situation.\u201d As a leader, Lerato plans to do as much as she possibly can for those in need.\n\nLerato is passionate about science and experimenting with different chemicals.

Through this company, Lerato wants to create jobs for Africans and engage in projects that will aid in the development of the continent. She sees this firm as \u201can empire that will create jobs all across the continent\u201d and consequently decrease the poverty rate.

In Tanzania, Sepiso was concerned about her family\u2019s dire financial situation and decided to do something about it. \n\nSepiso started a vegetable garden on a small piece of land at the back of her family home, despite her very limited knowledge of agriculture and an extremely skeptical reaction by her family.  Determined to create a sustainable vegetable garden that would help her family, Sepiso sought the help of her peers to find out how to go about the small farming project. Against the odds, Sepiso was able to successfully grow a flourishing vegetable garden. Sepiso displays perseverance when it comes to achieving her goals: when heavy rain began to wash away vegetables, Sepiso responded by creating a small drainage system. This vegetable garden now supplies her family all the vegetables it needs and also produces enough vegetables to sell to some of the neighbors in their community, thereby providing Sepiso\u2019s family with additional income. \u201cThis project made me see that even small sacrifices have large beneficial outcomes,\u201d says Sepiso. \n\nSepiso is also incredibly compassionate. After one of her aunts died from AIDS, Sepiso committed to volunteering at a clinic for HIV-positive children. \u201cIt is not enough to imagine the possibility of an HIV- free Africa, but [we need] to make it possible,\u201d she says. Sepiso plans to create an orphanage for children affected by HIV.\n\nPassionate about medicine, Sepisio plans to become a doctor and to ultimately specialize in the treatment of cancer. \u201cIn Tanzania, hundreds of people die every day from cancer, often because they are uneducated about the disease and do not have access to adequate facilities,\u201d says Sepiso. Sepiso plans to impact Africa by educating people on the importance of early treatment and treating patients diagnosed with cancer. \u201cA healthy population can build a healthy nation,\u201d she explains.\n\nSepiso is also a gifted student and was awarded as the best student in Mathematics in a nationwide competition. She also occupied several leadership positions at school including running the Environment Club, which initiated and ran projects to promote environmental cleanliness. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sepiso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748433},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735316},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614249},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629773},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668081},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504159817}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T00:48:04Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489428,"name":"Memory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Memory is a 19-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nMemory was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nMemory is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to be help her conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nMemory hails from remote Mpika, Zambia and is the third child in a family of five.

applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nAdil is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nAdil comes from Harare, Zimbabwe and is one of a family of four.\n\nAdil has always felt strongly about the impact that science and technology can have on transforming communities. Noticing the waning attendance and poor results of his school\u2019s science club, Adil decided to re-invent the club when he was appointed the club\u2019s president. Adil mobilized a group of some 18 students to submit entries to be exhibited at an upcoming Inter-District Science Exhibition. With new motivation thanks to the club\u2019s strong leadership, Adil\u2019s group went to win second prize at the exhibition, as a result of which they went on to represent their school on a provincial level. The science club is since highly regarded by students and teachers and has never battled with attendance since then.\n\nAdil was named the best student in geography and computer studies. In recognition of his leadership abilities, Adil occupied several leadership positions at his high school in Zimbabwe. He was junior President for three school clubs: the Quiz Club, Leadership Experience, and the Opportunity Club. He also served as captain of the swimming team. In addition to his leadership roles, Adil also excelled academically. Included in his numerous academic accolades was an award for best Science Club Student and Best Computer Student.\n\nIn 20 years\u2019 time, Adil sees himself as a prominent IT systems developer. He wants to promote and develop computer literacy and IT in his home country, Zimbabwe. He hopes to collaborate with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Education to implement IT studies as a compulsory subject starting at the primary school level. He also wants to start IT companies throughout Africa. \n\n\u201cI am greatly passionate about knowledge, aviation, and travel,\u201d says Adil. He explains that \u201cThe three are closely linked in that, aviation gives me an opportunity to travel, and by travelling I acquire knowledge, which is what I am most passionate about.\u201d\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1224854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748436},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735319},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614252},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-12T09:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439629776},{"amount":168,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468668083}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T07:37:57Z","paid_date":"2014-10-10T09:50:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":489442,"name":"Kudzaishe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kudzaishe, or \u201cPastor\u201d as he is known, is a 19-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nKudzaishe was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nKudzaishe is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nKudzaishe comes from a family of four and grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe. \n\nKudzaishe established himself as a leader and role model in his high school in Zimbabwe.

Odir, 25 years old, lives with his life partner and son in a very welcoming home.  Osiris, who was well referenced, is a very responsible person and a very enterprising young man who likes to work very vivaciously.  He is well respected by his acquaintances from whom he got very good references.  He works with basic grains, as a day laborer, and in coffee harvesting; farming in one of the major production zones for beans.  Everything he produces he sells in different areas of his community.  The demand increased which is why he asks INTEGRAL for a loan that will allow him to buy the supplies to well fertilize the beans because this way they will be in good condition and yield good foliage, which would allow him to get the best out of this harvest and increase his profits from what he believes has been a very good crop.

She is married to Marlito and a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nDanita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDanita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family.

She began her business through her own efforts and learned the trade from her mother who also ran a store.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to use as work capital to stock her store with daily consumption groceries such as rice, beans, bread, milk, eggs, chicken, barley and matches.  Sayda is grateful for the help being given to people with scarce resources who live in poor countries like Nicaragua, so they can earn a decent living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1225830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She sells coconut leaf roofing material, commonly referred to as \"makuti.\" Makuti is preferred for roofing in the Malindi area and along the coast generally, since it insulates the house from the heat, mainly experienced during the daytime. She has been running this business for ten years. She also sells fish and keeps goats.\nDama was introduced to Milango by her friends and is applying for a loan of 41,900 Kenya shillings to purchase more coconut leaves, fish and goats. Her main challenges are high inflation, which has reduced the purchasing power of most of her customers, and a shortage of reliable customers.\nDama will save the additional income generated with this loan and use it to provide for her family.

She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stock of supplies and products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She tried to expand her business to prepare not only cold drinks but fix up her kiosk to be a coffee shop and she added more snacks. \r\n\r\nNow, a few meters from her home, the government is going to build housing for residents in her district, and usually the workmen take breakfast and coffee time in her coffee shop. So Ida is using this loan to buy more cigarettes, coffee powder, sugar and snacks to prepare drinks in bigger amounts. \r\n\r\nFrom the profit Ida can prepare a better life for her children, for example, buying lesson books and taking her family to a local amusement park. Her dream is to send her child to college at Indonesia University."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1222037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

La demande de sa client\u00e8le devient de plus en plus grande et compte tenu de ses moyens limit\u00e9s, Vihoutou Raymonde n'arrive plus \u00e0 bien r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs exigences. Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 cela et compte tenu de leurs ressources limit\u00e9es, Vihoutou Raymonde et les autres membres du groupe WADAGBE 2 sollicitent ensemble un premier cr\u00e9dit aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9.","en":"The WADAGBE 2 group is made up of three people who are related and live in the same neighbourhood. The group representative, Vihoutou Raymonde, is the woman raising her hand in the photo. This is the group's first request for support from ALID\u00e9. They want to expand their businesses. Vihoutou Raymonde is 56 and has two children, neither of whom are in school. She lives independently and takes care of her needs on her own. She does not have much schooling. She has had her business for about twenty years now. She sells utensils and freezers through the distribution system. She gets her stock from Ghana and Togo. Demand is increasing, and she has limited means. She is not able to respond to her customers' demand. For this reason, and because all of the group members have limited resources, the WADAGBE 2 group is requesting their first loan together from ALID\u00e9."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1224673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stock of supplies and products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to give her children a good and quality education.

She is married to Jobert and is a mother to her children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCharlene operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sells them with a little profit. Her products are pillow cases, bedding and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Charlene is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCharlene hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1222309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional stocks of merchandise needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-26T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-25T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6764.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351096},{"amount":326.67,"local_amount":13332.98,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13528.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960235},{"amount":245,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10146.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094947},{"amount":326.67,"local_amount":13333.03,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13528.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484100},{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6764.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036626}],"funded_date":"2012-10-28T19:37:10Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":487934,"name":"Tuvshinjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Tuvshinjargal is a 42-year-old widow who lives with her 4 daughters in a ger in Govi-Altai province in Mongolia.
