Sevinc has more than eight years of experience in this field thanks to his father, who taught her how to best look after cattle. Her husband works as builder and receives an 80 AZN salary, which is too low to support the family.\r\n\r\nSevinc usually buys calves, raises and fattens them over five to six months, and resells them for a profitable price at the local livestock bazaar. She sells milk and yogurt to neighbors. Milk and meat selling brings in 210 AZN per month. Milk and yogurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yogurt sauce. Dairy products are considered to be very healthy and are present in everyday life. \r\n  \r\nThe family's income is not enough to cover basic needs of her beloved children.

Deep knowledge of her business and eight years of experience help her to run the business successfully. \r\n\r\nZeynab usually sells the crop from her garden in the central bazaar. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes use vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and also are used to make fresh punch. Her monthly income is 120 AZN. Raising crops takes a lot of strength and working in the open air is very hard for a woman which is why her husband helps Zeynab. \r\n\r\nShe needs additional capital to invest in seed and fertilizer. This will allow her to improve the quality of the products she raises and increase monthly turnover. For this purpose she applied for a loan of 1900 AZN.

She planned to sell a cow for buying food for the cattle, but preferred to get a loan so she is able to keep her livestock. Hay is cheap now, but the price increases by 30% to 40% in the winter months. She can significantly save on the costs of feeding the cows.

She is married and has two children, ages 30 and 26. In 2008, Gauri established her grocery store business, and she supports her family by working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day. In the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of pasal use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By purchasing inventory in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profits. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nGauri has already received and successfully repaid one loan from BPW Patan, which she also used to buy groceries for her pasal. In the future, Gauri plans to improve the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.

He is an Internally Displaced Person and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.   He breeds sheep and cattle and additionally sells milk products and meat. Namiq has more than six years of experience in this field, thanks to his father who taught him the best way to look after cattle. \r\n\r\nNamiq usually buys lambs, which he raises and fattens in three to six months and then resells them for a more profitable price in the local livestock bazaar.  Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat-selling bring AZN 150 income per month. \r\n\r\nMilk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt sauce.

She has a 16-year-old son, who is in his fourth year of secondary school. Both live in the city of Managua. Her work is selling food, especially breakfasts and lunches, in addition to tending a grocery store.\r\n\r\nShe began her business at the age of 35. She began selling food because the people who worked across the street from her house asked her for food and inquired about it, and so she decided to invest in a food business at home.  A short time afterwards, she began her grocery store business, since the people who came to her business were looking for products that are highly used in homes, and grocery store businesses are very scarce in this area.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLuzviminda operates a 'variety' store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five-pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her business, Luzviminda is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda hopes to give her children a quality education and dreams of expanding her business through all her hard work. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

could possibly cure her skin. One day, she placed an order for African black soup and raw shea butter and her body immediately responded to the natural ingredients found in these products. This discovery led Tisha to develop a passion for using and promoting all-natural skin products.\r\n\r\nWhen Tisha lost her job in 2008, she took it as an opportunity to follow her passion and started \"Skinfolk\", selling her own line of all-natural skincare products. Tisha is currently selling her products on Etsy and at local farmers' markets in San Diego, and her business is growing. However, due to a limited credit history and cash flow, Tisha struggled to secure the financing she needs to take her business to the next level from traditional sources.  \r\n\r\nTisha will use her Kiva loan to market her business and invest in higher quality materials. She hopes that with better marketing opportunities and more inventory, she will be able to increase profits and reach her full business potential. She eventually dreams of creating a stable financial situation for her family and would like to become a fair trade certified business in the near future.\r\n\r\nVisit Skinfolk online at:

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnatallia hopes to give her children a good and high quality education and dreams of expanding her business through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Noel, a businessman, and mother of three children, two of whom are already in college, while the youngest is still in high school. By the grace of God, Mercy has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Mercy. She herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMercy operates a vulcanizing shop. To vulcanize is to harden rubber by combining it with sulfur or other substances in the presence of heat and pressure. This is usually done to punctured tires. Vulcanization gives rubber strength, resistance and elasticity. She also sells tires. They have a tire supply. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 60,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more equipment for their business and also for items used to maintain their equipment. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMercy dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1222963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPio operates a retail business. What he basically does is buy bread at wholesale then sell in smaller quantities to customers for a profit. He already has regular bakeries where he delivers bread. His regular customers are his neighbors and some bakeries in his local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales daily.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more bread of different kinds to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nPio hopes his business will grow in the coming years and dreams to have his own house through all his hard work on his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He's from the Las Banderas region and makes a living buying and selling quarry stone as a street vendor.  He started this business as a driver and saved the money to buy the truck from his boss.  He goes out to sell the stone with the help of someone whom he pays for each trip he makes.\r\n\r\nHe needs this loan to invest in buying more quarry stone to sell, which he does as a street vendor.  This will be a big help to him because he'll be able to buy wholesale stone to sell and get better profits.\r\n\r\nOne of his plans for the future is to continue improving the infrastructure of his house so his children have a decent home.

","en":"Amina is 60 years old and lives with her husband. She was born to a simple farm family as one of many children but grew up as a very independent child and always helped her mother around the house. Amin has a college education and has raised two children with her husband who now live in Bishkek. Amina is a kind an honest woman and loves life. She and her husband are now retired but have started a livestock farm together in 1992. They began their business with 1,000 som (KGS) but their hard work and perseverance helped them expand the herd to include 4 cows, 20 sheep and 2 horses. The monthly profit of the family is about 3,000 som (KGS). In order to continue expanding her livestock business, Amina has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 55,000 som (KGS) which she will use to purchase a cow and a few sheep. Amina is planning to use the profits from this loan to continue increasing the number of animals and so be able to improve the lives of her family. In the future Amina hopes to save enough money to purchase a car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1223474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow and sheep to increase the herd","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"At-Bashy village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-27T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-26T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":705},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":705,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":33161.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071269},{"amount":470,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":22107.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754814}],"funded_date":"2012-10-30T04:59:19Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":488441,"name":"Aurita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Aurita.

She is married to Walter, and is the mother of seven children. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. Like most Filipino parents, Vilma believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nVilma operates an Internet caf\u00e9 business. There is more need, now than before, for services like these as customers\u2019 demand increases. Her main patrons are students who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume or any office documentation, as well as people who would just love to surf the 'net and any social network.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional computer parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVilma dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He says they chose this name because this little plant is very lucky. Although in the past some people didn't meet their payments and left the group, the remaining members are responsible and continue with the group because they help each other so the group can meet all payments. \r\n\r\n\"To\u00f1o, the photographer\" says he is known in his town. He started his business more than 30 years ago because since young he was struck on photography because his parents gave him a camera for his birthday. From there, he likes to take pictures of all beautiful things that nature has. \r\n\r\nThat's why he used to go to the Mariposa Monarca Sanctuary at an early hour, which is not far from his home, to take pictures of the sunrise with the butterflies when the sun had its first flashes of light and illuminated the beautiful forests of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. He says that caught his attention and decided to take a photography course through correspondence. Since he didn't have a steady job, he decided to start a photo studio and take the best moments of people and thus obtain profits from what passionate him that is photography. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to VisionFund because he wants to buy materials he uses for his photography such as material for developing, films for cameras, photo frames, albums for sale, bags, digital cameras, USB drivers, etc. He says he buys the material in the city of Mexico in several stores specialized in photography. He expects to improve the quality of life of his family with this loan.\r\n\r\nHe says his goal is to have a place where he can have his own business because rents are very high and he has losses. He also expects to have more work in order to make his dreams come true.       \r\n\r\nThe other 11 members of the group are Gabriella, Edit Veronica, Esperanza, Maria de Jesus, Ma Consuelo, Maria Eugenia, Edith, Maria Claudia, Natividad, Margarita y Juliette. They will invest their loans in items to stock grocery stores, to buy ingredients for food to sell, to buy ingredients for bread, to buy dead chickens to sell them per kilo, to buy jewelry to sell, to buy shoes and clothes by catalog, to invest in raw materials to make snow, ice-cream and to buy seasonal fruits and vegetables for sale.\r\n\r\nWe should hire To\u00f1o to take our pictures :-) What

Living with them are one daughter who studying nursing in college and two grandchildren. They help one of their daughters to support her children. Juan belongs to a group called El Fresno de la Soledad [The Ash Tree of La Soledad]. He says that they chose this name because there was an ash tree near their meeting place, and because their community is called La Soledad, and they decided to join the names together to name their group so that it would be easier to remember. He says that he has had a small grocery store for eight years, and that he opened it so that he could better help his family and his household. He also cultivates avocado and corn, which he sells at a supply center in a nearby village. He says that he sells his products twice a week to various other stores. He tells us that he opened his store in order to improve his household income and because there are no well-stocked stores like his in the area. He tries to have all the basic staples in his store for sale. He says that he is now requesting a loan for the purchase of eggs, even though the price of eggs has gone up quite a bit, because it is his most popular product. He will also buy sugar, soap, milk, bleach, salt, oil, cornmeal, rice, beans, chilli, mayonnaise, ham, sausage, bread, toilet paper, feminine products, etc. He wants to improve his store because he cannot afford to lose customers. His store is the best store in the community. He says that he also wants to buy some fertilizer and insecticides in order to improve his avocado trees, since he has to keep them very well-protected against the strong frost that is coming. He also needs to buy good fertilizers that won't burn the plants. \r\nThe other five group members are called Francisca, Omar, Rogelio, Felipe and Luis Antonio.

She is part of a group called \"Mariposas.\" \r\n\r\nShe says that it is the first time they have worked with Visi\u00f3n Fund, and that all the members are very happy. She says, \"We formed our group because we all need working capital to invest in our businesses. We went around asking several financial institutions, but none convinced us like Visi\u00f3n Fund, as it is the one with the lowest interest rates, and we decided to work with this institution.\" \r\n\r\nShe says that she works every day making tortillas with a woman who makes approximately 50 dozen tortillas a day by hand, the equivalent of some 600 tortillas. She works from Monday to Saturday to be able to help her husband with the household expenses, even though she would like to be self-employed and have a stable business. \r\n\r\nShe says she would like to sell tortillas from her home. Currently, she is asking for a loan to invest in the purchase of mattresses, sheets, bed coverings, towels and comforters by catalog. \r\n\r\nA friend told her that good earnings can be made selling bedding, and she hopes that it will go very well, as she bought the catalogs and people have already made several orders with her. Now all she needs is working capital to supply the orders. She says that she will sell on a payment plan, to make it easier for the customers to pay, and for her to gradually recover her investment. \r\n\r\nOlga is very happy, because she is really looking forward to having her own business, both making tortillas and selling bedding. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Feliza, Leticia, Maria Guadalupe, Anna Maria Arsenia, Juan and Sonia. They will invest their loans in the purchase of goods to sell: car parts, seasonal fruits and vegetables, seasonal women shoes, shoes by catalog, clothing by catalog, and candy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1219309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a member of the Las Divinas Communal Bank and says that they gave it that name because when they started the group a very popular serial started about some girls called Las Divinas and the group thought it sounded good and decided to name themselves that. Dora laughs a bit ashamed when she says the name of the group.\r\n\r\nShe says that she sells perfume for women and men, firming creams, scrubs, skin moisturizers, cosmetics, such as blush, powder and liquid makeup, nail polish and household items. She works for three companies and sells by catalog. She has had this business for seven years and enjoys the work because she meets many people from other communities and she can also take care of her home since she has three children and is married to Paulino, who farms vegetables. \r\n\r\nDora is requesting a loan in order to purchase items her customers have requested. She says she already has various things on order since right now she does not have the capital for supplies because she sells to her customers on credit. She notes that she buys her products from authorized distributors because they give her good prices. She also wants to sell quilts by catalog.

She is a woman eager to get ahead with her children. Recently she had to separate from her husband due to personal problems but she is doing as much as she can to help her children, whom she loves greatly, get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of Los Inversionistas Communal Bank and says they chose that name because the loans they request from the field partner are also invested in their businesses and, thanks to the funding, they have been able to gradually grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nMary, as they fondly call her, says that she engages in several activities in order to be able to buy what is necessary to educate her children because she has two in primary school. She says she gets up very early to make them breakfast and then takes them to their school. Immediately afterwards she puts up her stall, which she has in front of her childrens\u2019 school, where she sells drinks, sweets, caps, blouses and dresses knitted by hand that she makes herself. She also says that during the cold months she makes knitted scarves, caps, and gloves and they sell very well. In the afternoons, upon leaving her childrens\u2019 school, she collects her stall and then makes a meal quickly because then she goes to buy bread that she later sells on one of the principal streets of her town, which is called Zitacuaro. On weekends she goes to a restaurant to work as a waitress and thus is able to earn tips to maintain her household.\r\n\r\nMary says that she is proud to be a single mother because she, alone, is helping her children get ahead in their studies. She says \u201cthanks to the loans, they have made me save more and become more responsible and I have been able to manage the money I earn better and I have made my business grow and I am doing well.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe says that at the moment, she is requesting a loan to buy the supplies to continue doing her knitting. Now she wants to begin another business making flan, cheesecake, cakes and jello and sell them at her stall where she sells her knitted goods and sweets.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s goal is to have her own home because she is now renting a house and she would like to have something of her own so she won\u2019t have to spend so much in rent. She also wants a space where her merchandise will be safe. \r\n\r\nThe other nine members of the group are named Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Jose Antonio, Gloria, Maria del Carmen, Eva, Marcelino, Lucila and Esmeralda. They will invest in their business of selling shoes by catalog, buying and selling women\u2019s clothing, doing repairs in a machine shop, selling seasonal fruit and vegetables, perfume, cosmetics and will buy material to make embroidered handicrafts and compost and fertilizer to cultivate chiles manzanas (very hot chiles).\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":1220272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Margarita is one of those producers who, year after year, makes Christmas look beautiful with spectacular poinsettias of different sizes, colors and varieties. She says, \u201cI am proud to belong to this bountiful land; it is lovely to work with the flower that is most requested in December because it represents the birth of baby Jesus.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has been growing poinsettias for more than 10 years and, although sales have dropped drastically because so many people in the region also cultivate the flowers, she continues working because it is still a good business, although she invests too much time and capital in it. Right now she is requesting a loan to purchase fertilizer and paint for the greenhouses so the flowers will not mature too quickly and will be in good condition. She also will buy decorative paper because the big sales will begin in less than a month. She says that buyers from all over the country and abroad are coming because about 20 minutes away from her town there is a Monarch butterfly sanctuary and in December, the butterflies arrive.\r\n\r\nMargarita says she grows different varieties of poinsettias such as the Japanese, Chinese, Marbel, Marbel Star, etc. She says that her goal is to buy a van to use to transport her flowers and sell them in other states of the country so she will not have to pay freight because it is a bit expensive. \r\n\r\nThe four other members of the group are Diana, Erika, Maria Teresa and Florinda.
