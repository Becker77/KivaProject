Jackline is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasese, in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children; one of them is currently in school. For the past four years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells herbal liquid soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chemicals that will be used for making the liquid soap for sale, which will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to build a permanant house for herself. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Vulnerable

He wants to make a new investment that will increase production, so Pedro is requesting a loan from Apoyo Integral in order to buy corn, bean, and coffee seeds.

She is married and a mother to one son, who is ten years old. Ensherah is employed and earns a low salary, which is not enough to cover all her needs.\r\n\r\nEnsherah is requesting a USD loan from FATEN, to help her cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop. This will help Ensherah to do her homework and reports for work, and help her son in his studies. This will ensure a better future for Ensherah and improve the family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional computer parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAdora dreams to have a good future and hopes to expand her business all by the grace of God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

During the last 7 years, they have saved every penny of their money to build a house. However, her house is located in a boundary area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Her family is living a life full of happiness now that they have their own private house. Before building the house they lived in a rented house. \r\n\r\nBujlham and her husband have been running a taxi business in their spare time to increase the family income. Before the winter, her family has built their house hurry-scurry and interior finishings like walls, roof insulation, and installation of a heating system, are still to be completed.

She has 7 children.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding cows and sheep and doing general farm work!' Her biggest challenge is 'Diseases'. Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Chemwai and Kiyo'. She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nSusan has been doing this work for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services.\r\n\r\nSusan was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because i have seen Juhudi Kilimo improving the lives of people in my village by financing farmers'. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'I learnt about the kind of projects financed by micro-finance institutions'.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expenses are farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Susan replied, 'I will sell milk and get money to feed my family and also educate my children'.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Susan owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1224140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 57 years old and lives with her husband. Kulbarchin is a cheerful, kind and honest woman. Kulbarchin is a Mother Heroine [note: this is a title from Soviet times, given to mothers of large families], as she and her husband raised 8 children, most of whom now live in Bishkek. After the fall of the USSR, Kulbarchin began working in agriculture - animal husbandry and milk sales. Her husband helps her with the farming. Thanks to her hard work and determination, today their farm is very developed and well-maintained. The monthly income of their family is approximately 3,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Because livestock prices are currently low, Kulbarchin wants to increase the number of livestock she has, and has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy 12 sheep and 1 cow. She plans to use the income that will be generated by this purchase to increase her herd and thus improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to further increase her herd, which will help to realize her long-held dream of building a house. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1224158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 12 sheep and 1 cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Oktyabr village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-29T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-28T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulbarchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20226.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012455},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495372},{"amount":1505,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":70791.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776896}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T03:19:08Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey Orr","image":1320363}},{"id":489037,"name":"Sabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabina is married with six children.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services, and a personal business.\r\n\r\nRoselwe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is, \"Keeping dairy cows and horticulture!\" Her biggest challenge is animal feeds during dry season and diseases. The animals on her farm have been given the names of Korai, Cheboron and Lab. She will use this loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nRoselwe was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"Because it finances small holder farmers in their activities.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She says, \"It is short term loans for farmers.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Roselwe replied, \"Money from the sale of milk will help in paying the school fees for my children and [provide] milk for drinking.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Roselwe owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more

Olivia hopes that in the future she will be able to build a permanent house for her self. \r\n\r\nOlivia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1224327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Her older son left to work in the Russian Federation and her younger son helps on the farm. She was born in the city of Kok-Zhangak. \r\n\r\nSalima completed a technical high school degree, evidence that she is a conscientious and decent person. In addition, Salima always keeps her affairs in order. She works as a cook at a kindergarten, but the main source of her family's income is animal husbandry. After the fall of the Soviet Union, her family began to work in this field, which helped feed them during perestroika. The initial business capital was 30,000 som. Since that time, her family has tried to improve their living conditions and increase the head of cattle they own. Today their monthly income is 10,000 - 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith the long-term goal of expanding her business, Salima turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 35,000 som (KGS) to purchase extra heads of cattle at a lower price. Salima plans to use the extra income to improve her family's well-being and pay for her son's future wedding.

apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Since 2010, he has been working as a petroleum tank truck driver for a fuel company. His sister is a student and will finish her university studies in the coming spring. His brother-in-law works as an assistant worker in a chain store. Oyunbaatar and his family have been renting their apartment for the last three years. In August of this year, they decided to buy a plot of land in a boundary area of the city and to build a 64-square-meter house with less energy consumption compared to usual wooden houses. The house-building process is going as well as planned. Now, they have laid the foundation and bricked up the two-side wall of the house with block. Adding the roof, completing the walls, and decorating the interior still need to be done. Oyunbaatar is asking for a 5,000,000 MNT loan to complete his house and install an electric floor heater in order to reduce coal usage. By doing this he and his family will live in their own house and contribute their efforts to save the environment.

lives with her husband.  She was born into a simple farming family with many children and since childhood, Amina has been independent and helpful to her mother in running the household.  Amina has a high school education.  The children she raised with her husband live in Bishkek.\r\n\r\nAmina is a very cheerful, kind and honest woman.  She and her husband are pensioners.  Her husband helps her run the household and works as a taxi driver in his spare time.  Since 1992, Amina has been involved in keeping livestock.  Their startup capital was 1,000 Som (KGS).  Thanks to their hard work and dedication, they now have one cow and ten sheep on their farm.

This will better the view of her house and enable Jamalat and her family to enjoy living in their house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1224422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to paint the house and install new doors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-10-29T12:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-28T12:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamalat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":58.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.4,"local_amount":47.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-21T10:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":47.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324035018},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":48.26,"processed_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":48.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331233190},{"amount":99.2,"local_amount":99.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":99.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339615127},{"amount":805.14,"local_amount":805.14,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T09:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":805.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347793857}],"funded_date":"2012-11-21T13:38:35Z","paid_date":"2013-03-21T09:06:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":489211,"name":"Mona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mona is a 59-year-old married woman and a mother of 7 children.

For the past year, Jenniffer has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells general household goods like rice and baking flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jenniffer has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stock like sugar, cooking oil and soap for resale. It will help her to generate greater profits, cover her basic needs like food, and add more unique items to her stock. Jenniffer hopes that in the future, she will be able to own a salon. \r\n\r\nJenniffer is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She is 20 years old and lives in the town of Ggaba. For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her pharmacy, where she sells medicine and injectables. To help expand her business, Lydia has requested a loan for 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more medicines and a scanning machine that she can use in the pharmacy. This loan will help Lydia generate greater profits and pay her sister's school fees. Her goal for the future is to continue to expand her business. She is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and offers a forum for life-skills

She sells clothes for both boys and girls. She started in this business with the amount of 14,000 LD (fourteen thousand Liberian dollars) as her capital.  One of the difficulties she faces is low sales during  the rainy season. She makes a profit when she sells, especially during the christmas season. Waletoe is requesting her third loan from BRAC Liberia, to purchase more used clothes for the business.

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Daniel replied that his income will greatly improve and he will be able to give his children a decent living.\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Daniel owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1222318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase and insure a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2012-10-29T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-28T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":29,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3829.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3930.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3730.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5236.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5375.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4970.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5102.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4842.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4140.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4596.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4717.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4034.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4362.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4478.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4251.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.63},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":67600,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68239.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753185}],"funded_date":"2012-11-03T16:32:06Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:38:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":484528,"name":"Linet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linet is 40 years old, married to Elkanah, and has been blessed with six children that she supports.

Besides this business, Nyevu also sells dresses and used to own a poultry farm, which she now intends to revive. She learned about Milango through a friend and joined our organization with an aim of accessing credit to improve her business. Her main challenges are damaged pipes and pumps.

This will help her generate greater profits and take care of herself and her grandmother. Her goal for the future is to start a catering business. Edina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Mario noticed that the Brazilian community had limited access to information and news in their own language, so he decided to create Manchete USA, an online newspaper available in Brazilian Portuguese. \r\n\r\nThe website features news from Brazil, the world, U.S. politics, immigration issues and updates, sports and news about the Brazilian Community in the U.S. Mario loves his work, but he really enjoys watching his community engage with his articles. \r\n\r\nFor Mario, the biggest challenge for Manchete USA is getting the world out about a young newspaper. This is why he is currently working on branding his business to attract more readers, more advertising and more website traffic. One of his tactics has been to gather local restaurants and businesses as sponsors to  support the newspaper by offering coupons on his website. \r\n\r\nMario is asking for a loan to purchase a new computer, a professional camera and a new printer. These items will help him accommodate the new demand that will come from his campaign. His goal is to keep working to build a successful business that will serve as an example for his daughter and son.

She is a widow and a mother to her children. She manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nFatima runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Fatima\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special items are displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day.\n \nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy additional used quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nFatima hopes to give her children a good future through all her hard work on her business.

This is quite an expensive process which requires labor and special equipment.  When he heard about water loans, he was extremely excited and applied for a 2000 AZN loan.

She is married to Jamaludin, a vendor, and is mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nNaima runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Naima\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Yolanda\u2019s stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \n\nTo help her expand the business, Naima is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nNaima hopes to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is part of the group, El Esfuerzo (The Effort), and she says that they gave the group this name because with much effort they are raising their families. She relates that more than 20 years ago she and her husband created their own business to raise their children and also to provide employment. She makes various articles of wood, such as balusters, wooden boxes for fruit, railings, handrails, etc. Guillermina says that she is applying for a loan to purchase brushes for different types of finishes, varnish and sandpaper to polish the wood, nails, and glue, and that she will buy her supplies in the city of Toluca in stores that specialize in wood. She also says that they take the wood to their house, where they make all their creations, and that now what their customers have been asking for most is boxes for avocados, and that since there are already a  number of producers of this fruit, they have placed orders, and this is why they are asking for the loan, to stock a little more wood and begin to make them, because the customers are anxious to get them, and she hopes that with the loan that they are asking for they will have enough. Guillermina says \"I hope that this request goes well for us to continue making more boxes in bulk. I hope to advance because now I have very substantial expenses with one of my 'kids' who is now in high school, and this is why I am working really hard to help my husband with the expenses, and this is why I am committed to the loan.\r\n\r\nThe other 14 people in the group are Yolanda, Consuelo, Maria Clara, Carolina, Maria Isabel, Rosalinda, Guadalupe, Flor de Maria, Maria Isaura, Manuela, Aurelia, Carolina, Juan Carlos, and Angelina. They will invest their loans in repairs for a taxi, to purchase basic ingredients to make churros, to buy fabric, thread, and needles to make clothing, to purchase ingredients to make Mexican snacks, to purchase cosmetics and sell them on installment plans, and to stock a grocery

Her husband is running a taxi business, too. Her family consists of six members: her husband and four children,  They live in their small wooden house in the ger district, an area with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nEvery day Narantuya and her husband pay twenty dollars each for the car they are using. And three years later, they will get the cars.  Before these, they got two cars from a taxi service company and sold them. \r\n\r\nWith the money, they bought a plot of land in the remote area of the city and built their house on it.  In winter, her house loses its heat through the door and gets colder, so she needs to use a coal stove to stay warm. Coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia. So Narantuya is requesting MNT 2,000,000 loan to build a small barn where the house door meets the outside. \r\n\r\nBy doing this, her house can reduce the heat loss, and she will burn less coal, and her family will live in a comfortable condition.

For the past two years, Mosaab has been operating a workshop repairing electrical generators, and selling spare parts. It has been a profitable project, and the only source of income to him, but also needs more support to cover the cost.\n\nMosaab is looking to provide his customers with better quality, so he is requesting a USD loan from FATEN in order to help him cover the cost of purchasing new repair kit. This will enable Mosaab to improve the quality of his work, and take less time in repairing the electrical generators, which will lead to customer satisfaction and improve his income. Mosaab's photo is in his workshop.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Lizeth is originally from Colombia and has been living in the U.S. for almost three years. She is the owner of LDN Technologies, a home-based company that focuses on the wholesale distribution of technology. The idea for this business has long been in Lizeth\u2019s mind, but it wasn\u2019t until she moved to the U.S. that she found the opportunity to start it. \r\n\r\nHer business sells wholesale computer parts and hardware to businesses, with a focus on Latin America. Upon receiving orders, Lizeth visits the companies where she purchases the products and takes a courier who then handles the shipment. For Lizeth, her biggest success has been being able to expand her business to other countries.\r\n \r\nThis loan will help Lizeth purchase more inventory for her business. Being able to buy the parts and hardware in bulk will help her to get a much more competitive price from the sellers. Lizeth\u2019s goal as a woman and as an entrepreneur is to grow the business enough to become economically independent, enter bigger markets and become competitive in the technology distribution industry.

Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":489465,"name":"Gregory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Watching his dad transform his carpentry hobby into a contracting business helped inspire 10-year-old Greg\u2019s dream to one day own a business. When he grew up \u2013 turning 29 this past summer \u2013 Greg realized his dream by merging his love for cycling with the transportation industry to create a taxi service called Little Rock Pedicab in Little Rock, Arkansas.\r\n\r\nGreg took four months to put his thoughts together, order bikes, purchase insurance, and become licensed; he\u2019s currently waiting on inspections to approve the bikes before he can completely operate. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m trying to process is making sure it\u2019s a safe and enjoyable ride,\u201d Greg says. \u201cI just want people to enjoy themselves and not be concerned about the ride.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe also carefully researched the pedicab industry to be certain he made the safest cabs possible.  For example, when he discovered many bicycle wrecks were reported because trolley tracks are wide enough for bicycle tires to get stuck between, Greg outfitted his pedicabs with wider motorcycle tires that can\u2019t get stuck.  He also learned that Arkansas come in last among the United States when it comes to bicycle participation \u2013 so he is now on a mission to improve that rating.\r\n\r\nGreg\u2019s pedicabs carry up to 700 pounds and have a top speed of about 20 miles per hour.  However, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be going that fast. \u201cWhen you take your time getting somewhere, you actually get to see the world around you and really enjoy it,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Greg employs himself and rents to a handful of subcontractors who serve as drivers.  He hopes to grow a demand for pedicabs in Little Rock and then expand, but he says he would not be at this point in his business had he not received a loan from Accion Texas Inc.  While looking into lenders, Greg found the majority of them required a business owner to already be in business before they were considered for a loan. Accion was one of the only lenders he found that assisted start-up businesses. \r\n\r\nThe majority of his loan went to purchase the pedicabs, the rest went to insurance and other start-up costs.  \u201cThe Accion Texas loan really started the process of owning my own business. Without it, I wouldn\u2019t have started my business now.  I would have had to wait for years, because most lenders wouldn\u2019t lend to beginners.\u201d\r\n\r\nGreg says, \u201cThanks to Accion for helping me accomplish the dream I had since I was a kid. Traditional banks didn\u2019t believe in me, but talking to people at Accion made me feel that they believed in me, the person behind the business. Thanks for believing.\u201d \r\n\r\nFind out more about Greg\u2019s business at his Website: http:\/\/lrpedicab.com\/; Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LittleRockPedicab; and Twitter page:

She lives with her partner and has a 21-year-old son who works and goes to school.  Mary began with her business 20 years ago.  Her husband left his job in a company so they could make a living working together.  This is how they started making caps and various sports souvenirs.\n\nTheir main customers are people who go to stadiums.  They sell their products themselves and make a living in sales.  Mary's happy about her business, especially when sales are good.\n\nWith the loan she's going to buy fabric to continue making garments and she'll also buy sports polo shirts, which are in great demand among her customers.\n\nHer biggest dream is to make a living sewing polo shirts.  For now she's not doing it because it's a major investment, but she hopes to do it very soon.\n\nMary's grateful for her job, which allows her better finances for her household.  She's also very grateful to the Kiva lenders, who allow her and her group to get their loan.\n\n*Mary's the first in line, wearing a black sweater.  On the left side is Sra.
