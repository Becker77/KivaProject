Her dream is to see her home finished in an acceptable manner. Business-wise, she hopes to attract new customers, market new products and expand the kiosk.  Thanks to loans from Afodenic, she will achieve an increase in sales, and thus provide a better standard of living for her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":238727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janett Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.56,"local_amount":1115.42,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816748},{"amount":58.11,"local_amount":1106.8,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351428},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038766},{"amount":58.43,"local_amount":1113.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929065},{"amount":59.11,"local_amount":1125.82,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383983},{"amount":58.99,"local_amount":1123.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1168.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890450},{"amount":58.62,"local_amount":1116.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1160.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111752},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":1076.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1118.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533178},{"amount":58.36,"local_amount":1111.12,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964572}],"funded_date":"2009-01-05T04:10:57Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":83590,"name":"Sophie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"G.

","en":"Buenaventura Ojetaciano C. is 43 years old and single.  His goal is to keep his business going because he totally depends on it as his only source of income and a means to help his brother, nieces and nephews, his only family.  He most wants to set the business up in a better place because he would like to have his own shop, preferably in his house, a grocery where he can sell his merchandise.  He dreams of remodeling his humble house and teaching his nieces and nephews the importance of hard work in reaching your goals.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion Leon 2000 before and his performance has been very good.  He's made a success of the business because he's persistent and because he knows that he can get what he wants if he works hard.\r\n<p>\r\nBuenaventura makes a living selling snacks and cold drinks.  His business is located on the northern edge of UNAN, just outside the university.  He's operated the business for 20 years.  He started it on his own, having learned to work hard from the time he was a boy, with only a few products kept in a basket, selling cigarettes and candy to passers-by.  He worked as a street vendor around Leon where he met a lot of students who were customers for the cigarettes he sold.  The work was exhausting because his house was far away, so he decided to find a spot to set up permanently.  He had to find a place with a lot of passers-by so he decided on the street near UNAN.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion twice and has a good payment record.  He's now applying for a loan which he will use for working capital.  He'll increase the range of products he sells to meet customer demand and buy from different distributors in Leon so that he can get a favorable return for Fundacion Leon 2000 and the organizations that are interested in helping small businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":267348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-07T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buenaventura Ojetaciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":1158.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092059},{"amount":42.05,"local_amount":841.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":841.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985441},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446057},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":1014.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1014.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956694},{"amount":99.27,"local_amount":1985.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174117}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T20:11:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":91782,"name":"Rk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"RK A. is a 70-year-old married man with six children.

She wants to make her business grow and because of this, she would like to borrow PHP 5,000.00 so that she can buy more stocks of groceries for her store and hopefully be able to sell meat and fish. She is also engaged in selling eggs and ducks in their public market for additional income. She hopes that her business will continue to grow so that her two children will finish their studies.\r\n <p>\r\nAccording to Marivic, she is now content with her life.

She lives with her husband and her four children whose ages range between 12 and 27.  The three youngest go to school.  She isn't responsible financially for anyone else and saves 1,500 meticais a month.<p>\r\nLina left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland with her oldest brother, who was working for the registry office in that district.  When she arrived to Namaacha, she enrolled in school.  In that same year, she became pregnant and had to stop studying because at that time it wasn't allowed to go to school while pregnant.  She got married, and five days later, her husband abandoned her and left for South Africa.  He left a letter that she only discovered 6 months later claiming that he was going to look for a job.  Her life was difficult, so she asked her brother for help, and he got her a job at the registry office where she worked for 5 years.  After she finished her contract, she married her current husband who now lives with her in her home.  With the money she made from her job, she started her own business selling capulanas (robes\/dresses) which she acquired in Maputo and resold in Swaziland.  Her business has grown and she can't satisfy her customers' demand anymore.  She is turning to Hluvuku and Kiva for her fourth loan so she can increase her stock of merchandise.  Today she has better products (sheets, blankets, duvets, pants, and curtains).  She buys these items for 400, 500, and 350 meticais and resells them for 1,000, 1250, and 600 meticais.  She makes a monthly profit of 8,000 meticais.<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  Her first one was for 11,000 meticais to buy various types of clothing like blouses, sheets, duvets, blankets, pants, and curtains).  Her second one was for 15,500 meticais to increase her volume of merchandise.  Her third was for 20,000 meticais to expand her kitchen, which is now complete.  This one is for 25,000 meticais, which she will use to increase the volume of her business.  She is building a boutique because at her age she doesn't want to make deliveries to people's homes anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed as added capital for her food business.  Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 18,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital for expanding her business by buying different food ingredients and seasoning for the food that she sells in her food stand.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that one day her mini food stand will become a restaurant for their family business. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community. Lilybeth has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 2,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lilybeth joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilybeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase construction materials for a house repair. Lilybeth is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. This fishing activity is managed by her husband. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Lilybeth from PMPC and this is her third time published on Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

","en":"This group is called \u201cTIACAQUE\u201d because that\u2019s the name of the community and the name means \u201cplace where the water rises between cliffs\u201d because the community is located on top of a small hill and between some dams.  \r\n\r\nIt is located in the community of Tiacaque, M\u00e9xico, which has a tourist center of the same name noted for its trout hatcheries.  Adjacent are the communities of San Francisco Cheje and Ejido de Malacota.  It\u2019s a place where residents, for the most part, raise livestock: sheep, calves, doves and wild animals in general.\r\n\r\nThe group has 12 members.  One of them is Mar\u00eda Cristina O. M., 28.  She finished secondary school and she comments that she wants to use her business to help her husband so that their children can become professionals as well as learn to run a business so that some day they can have their own.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children, a boy and a girl.  She raises sheep that she sells in the Ixtlahuaca market on Mondays and also to neighbors and relatives primarily.\r\n\r\nShe started four years ago not thinking it would become a source of income.  She enjoys the business because profits she earns from it provide a few comforts for her children but especially guarantees that they have enough to eat.\r\n\r\nHer dedication and perseverance will make good sales possible because she has faced difficulties, like animal disease and death, in the past.  However, with help from the loan she will rise above these problems and keep her business safe.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":621590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To restart her cattle raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-21T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irais","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2053},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2106},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2160},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2215},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2272},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2331},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2390},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2515},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2579},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2645},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2713},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2783},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2854},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2928},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3004}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.18},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.94},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":335.32,"local_amount":4159,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4177.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387602},{"amount":916.54,"local_amount":11368,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11417.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525498},{"amount":821.65,"local_amount":10191,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10235.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660041},{"amount":1151.49,"local_amount":14282,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14344.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403310}],"funded_date":"2010-10-22T15:29:13Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":244228,"name":"Fatimatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"G. est une femme de 36 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants, son mari est un chauffeur de camion, elle exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de  ma\u00efs, mil et sorgho. elle s\u2019approvisionne \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du pays dans le march\u00e9 local d'ani\u00e9.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

in 1962 in Ahonlogo\u00e9, Mr. Yawo A. is the father of seven children, some of whom are apprentices and others are in school. He specializes in market gardening and has a business growing chili peppers and vegetables. But when the water dries up, he can no longer run his business and has to temporarily cease trading. His ability to manage his income has, until now, allowed him to meet the needs of his household. Hoping to increase the area he farms in order to make more profit, he plans to buy a motorized pump to make it easy to water his garden. He also needs fertilizer. To do this, he is asking for a loan of $1,000. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962 \u00e0 Ahonlogo\u00e9, Monsieur A.

When she first borrowed money, she used it to breed chickens and pigs. Her income from breeding pigs and chickens was used for expanding the farm, increasing the number of animals. In 2006, Mrs. T. switched from breeding pigs and chickens to investing in building material such as bricks, cements, tiles, etc. Her store provides materials for many building projects and also satisfies local needs. Besides, she collects wasted material. In 2007, Mrs. T. was able to build a 3-storey house of 150 meter square area. This time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to buy more bricks, sands and gravels.

She is 40 years old, and is married with two children. She puts a lot of effort into the development of her farming efforts because she is aware that they can help her children. The unconditional support that she receives from them provides her with optimism, and despite the financial shortcomings at home, she tries to alleviate those shortcomings efficiently. Her wish is to improve the living conditions of her family and is requesting a loan to increase the quality and quantity of her products. She requests 2000 Somoni ($ 600 USD). She wants to purchase seeds for wheat and onions and mineral fertilizer. Arofat is very grateful to everyone who is helping her to achieve her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marie was born around 1950 in Adjohoun, a village of Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of B\u00e9nin.  She is married and the mother of five children, who are all in school.  She sells various goods (soap, pasta, milk, 5-kg sacks of rice, etc.).  Her work generates income for her and allows her to cope with family expenses for a time, short though it may be.  But due to the financial means needed for acquiring supplies on time to respond effectively to the demand, Marie is losing customers.  This is why she needs a loan, so as to bolster her business and to retain her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

She was born on the 8th of September 1963. M. and her family live in a four-room house in the Baingo neighborhood in the Belo subdivision in the North Region of Cameroon. Because she is the breadwinner of the family, she finds it very difficult to take care of the family single handedly. In addition, she sustained a serious accident and she was robed by thieves.  Faced with her low level of education, she could not secure a good job for herself. Thus, she embarked on the sale of second-hand dresses, which she has been doing for 2 years.\n\nBecoming a member of GHAPE in 2008, she was fortunate to have acquired some techniques which have helped her to improve her business. She has proven successful with her previous loan, which she had conscientiously managed and repaid. Her business is going to help her community in that she will be able to supply the market with second-hand dresses. She plans to repay the loan in 12 months and repayment shall commence on the date of disbursement.\n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

clothing and a RTW (ready-to-wear clothing) business. She lives in Poblacion, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,100. \r\n\r\nDebbie is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can fund her business activities. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Debbie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has 4 children who range in age from 19 to 29.  She has a small general store where she sells office supplies, clothing, and many items that her customers buy from her with cash and on credit.  Her main customers are housewives and young people in her neighborhood and neighborhoods to the east.  She learned her business 30 years ago when she lived in the municipality of Maicao, a border area characterized by formal and informal commercial activity.  At first, she started selling clothing and toiletries that she distributed among a few customers.  When she moved to Malambo, she continued her business with the goal of helping with her family's finances.  Only her husband was contributing to their income.  He is an electrician and travels the majority of the time.  For 4 years, she has had her business in her home and although she started it without physical infrastructure, she currently has 2 display cases and a photocopier where she offers photocopying services.  This is her first loan, which she will use to strengthen her business.  With it, she will be connected to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She saw this as an excellent opportunity to start her credit history.

She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Luy\u1ebfn owns & operates a business venture in the services sector providing waste management services.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from hauling second-hand goods for local businesses and community members.  Luy\u1ebfn has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Luy\u1ebfn joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Luy\u1ebfn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,184,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase scrap metal to sell.  Luy\u1ebfn is now requesting a new loan of 9,632,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell.  This will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Luy\u1ebfn plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mariam is proud to be the only Hajjat in the group of Nkokonjeru. Her business is buying and selling mukene (small silvery fish) from Nkombwe landing site in Ngogwe Sub County for eight years now. Before this business, Hajjat used to sell tomatoes and onions, but because they were perishables, she was always losing money.\r\n<P>\r\nWith the small fish, it\u2019s a matter of drying them properly; do so and they will last for a very long time. Mariam says the prices of the fish keep fluctuating depending on the season, and this influences her selling price. Mariam is a widow who cares for five orphans and three other orphans (her stepchildren), who are all in school; two are in candidate classes.\r\n<P>\r\nSince she started getting loans, Mariam has managed to care for her family and has bought some land for farming hence reducing the cost of buying everything including food. She has also bought some goats which she sells and has a dream of buying a cow (a good one costs about one million Uganda shillings). A cow would provide milk for sale, and Mariam hopes this will happen for her and her family soon. She plans to buy more small fish for her stock once she has access to a loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":217591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more fish for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nkokonjeru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 32.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-10-28T21:30:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Babirye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-12T02:31:05Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1087500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966511},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882708},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20432242},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27126581}],"funded_date":"2008-10-29T01:31:05Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:21:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":75430,"name":"Vu Thi Kieu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. L. is 30 years old and lives in the Nghe An Province, in Vietnam.

She puts the damask and scarves into dyes, which she learned to do from a friend.  She has a spot at the Sikasso bus station, where she is in high demand.  Because of this location, her business is doing superbly, with her customers composed essentially of drivers and employees working there.  \r\n\r\nIn her search for supplemental financial resources, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After three solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, with a women's association in her district (Association BADEYA de Sanoubougou I), she is on her second PIC (an individual commercial loan).  She intends to use this loan to buy 18 lengths of damask, 50 packets of scarves, 5 bags of caustic soda, and 5 containers dyes of different colors.  She buys the damask, caustic soda, and dyes locally, and the scarves -- in Niono by special order.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889537},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440324},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135698},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033499},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620867},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019832},{"amount":65.57,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242599},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32228,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678122}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T11:27:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":87718,"name":"Nang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nang P. lives in Pong Ror village in Kampong Cham province.

The loan will be used to buy supplies and materials necessary for the members' various businesses.

Her one big dream is to improve her family's standard of living, to have enough capital to expand her business, and to prepare her four children for a better future. Her dream started to become a reality when she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nEmelinda is 52 years old and is married to Artimio G., who helps her manage their business. They have four children, aged 22 to 29 years old. Two of their children already have their own families and the other two still live at home -- one works as a seaman and other is a student.\r\n\r\nEmelinda and Artimio started out selling pork to retail customers. They bought pigs and had them butchered, and then her husband delivered the pork meat to various meat shops on consignment. This earns them a good living, but they are always on the lookout for other business opportunities, so in 2000 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and opened a new business selling spare parts and electronic gadgets. \r\n\r\nThey continued with their pork retail business, earning a combined monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). They use their income to support their household expenses and pay for school tuition, and they have some left over for savings. Emelinda had a previous loan of 29,500 PHP, which she used for both her spare parts and her pork retail business. She repaid this loan in full within its loan term and without any delays. She is now borrowing for her 23rd cycle the same amount of 29,500 PHP. She will use this loan as additional working capital and to purchase additional spare parts inventory. \r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Emelinda is shown in her spare parts and electronics business with her husband in the background.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. This is Project Dungganon.

The group members, such as the highly sought-after Awa Traor\u00e9, sell cereals and fabric, firewood and atiek\u00e9 (a manioc-based food). Awa Traor\u00e9 aims to use her loan to buy 30 cartloads  of manioc, which will be processed to atiek\u00e9; she sources her goods from the Loulouni market and from the neighbouring villages. \r\nThe atiek\u00e9 is sold retail and wholesale for cash at the Loulouni market, to a male and female customer base. Awa envisages generating an average monthly profit of 18, 000 FCFA - a portion of this will be saved to pay for her children's education and the family's food, and the rest will be re-invested in

After a period of several months she hopes that her animals will be the right weight and ready to sell.  She also obtains income when she hires out her animals.  She hires out her bull, for example, during the sowing season so that people can use it to plow.  Another business activity which she pursues is selling the milk which her cow produces.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

There are 20 entrepreneurs who work in the areas of preparing traditional food and selling clothing and perfume.  All of them live in the city of Castro.\r\n\r\nNilda is a member of the communal bank; in the photo she is in the middle of the group, in the third row from the bottom, wearing glasses.  She works preparing and selling traditional food in the southern part of Chile.  Among these dishes are \"milcao\" [potato pancakes], \"chuchoca\" [potato bread], \"empanadas\" [meat pies], homemade bread, and \"curanto\" [clambake].  She has been in this business for 14 years, and she uses her home to prepare the food.  She has a gas stove, a wood-burning stove, a dough spreader, pots (metal cooking containers in the shape of a half-sphere and generally with two handles), and pans.\r\n\r\nShe says that her schedule is totally flexible and that the season of highest demand is during the summer, since there are many traditional festivals and fairs.  Generally she buys her ingredients in the supermarket, where the prices are better, and in this way it has gone very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to build a \"quincho\" [thatched barbecue area] to offer her meals in the same place, so her customers eat the food right there.  Nilda also wants to get an industrial oven for her meals, since she also works in rendering, which consists of killing and later cooking a pig and other food in a cauldron to make lard.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and two children, ages 19 and 17, who help her advertise her meals and attract new customers.  One of her dreams is that one of her children will finish studying, since in that way there would be better job options.  She also would like to travel throughout the country to know some places.\r\n\r\nNilda is very happy and grateful for the services granted by Fondo Esperanza, since she can count on capital that will allow her to invest in her business.  She also enjoys the communal bank meetings with great happiness and affection, since the group is united and supportive.\r\n\r\nCastro is the capital of the island of Chilo\u00e9 (the biggest island in South America), in the region of Los Lagos, in the south of Chile.  The natural landscape is conserved almost totally without human intervention.  It also has a culture rich in myth and tradition.  The \"palafitos,\" structures (houses) built on wood pilings on the shore above the ocean, are one of the greatest attractions there.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":917622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to build a \"quincho\" [thatched barbecue area] where her customers can eat their meals and to get an industrial oven.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Castro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T01:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Camila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1983965,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138126},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134026},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135309},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":136600},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":137908},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":139224},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":140555},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":141894},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":143254},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":144615},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":145999},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":147387},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":148798},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150270}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.48},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.22},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.81},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.41},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280.7},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.16},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":302.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1655.66,"local_amount":821193,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":822283.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561329},{"amount":1149.86,"local_amount":570318,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":571075.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772324},{"amount":1194.48,"local_amount":592454,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":593240.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180771}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T14:34:16Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":359035,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eva, de 40 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena, amable y muy responsable.

He could send his children to school, attend to them when they fall sick, feed and clothe them. Though he faces some few challenges in his business, like that of bad debtors,  Alimany is nevertheless expecting a lot of improvements in his life with this new loan.

She knits clothes for babies and children up to 5 years old.  When she started, she knit by hand.  As time passed, she bought a machine and her production has increased.  Martha estimates that the purchase of clothes for the end of the year festivities will increase, and she needs a loan to buy the raw material like wool.  She buys her supplies at the 16 de Julio (a fair), and also sells her products at the 16 de Julio.  Her customers are women who have fixed sales places.  That means that she sells wholesale, and the other people sell by the unit.  Martha has five children that she takes care of and protects.\r\n\r\nAnother example is Evelyn L., who is only 19.  She goes to school and she makes clothes like skirts.  With her mother\u2019s help, she sells them in Desaguadero, Los Yungas, and Santa Cruz.

She has been in this business for five years and believes the hardest part is having to carry her merchandise with her to another city where she sells.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Elena hopes that her business will grow and that she will be able to open her own clothing store where she can serve her customers more comfortably.  This is her first loan with MFP and she expects to make her payments on time.  Elena is admired by the other members of her Communal Bank because of her cheerfulness.  With her loan of 800 soles, she plans to buy more jeans so that she will have a greater amount inventory available to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":460275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase jeans to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-29T20:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124408},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960149},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992993},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717779},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751454},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933907}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T22:23:10Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":169955,"name":"Luzminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luzminda M. is from Bliss Baybay, Ozamiz City.

Victoria community of the city of Temuco.  Their businesses are, primarily, selling dried fruits and nuts, used clothing, vegetables and salads, desserts, and doing sewing.\r\n\r\nThe group member interviewed was Edith, who is the group\u2019s president.  In the photo she is pictured in the third row on the left, wearing a gray sweater over a red shirt.  From her home she runs a business selling pinecones and firewood.  \r\n\r\nEdith posts advertisements in places like schools and restaurants around her community.  After the forests around Temuco are cut for timber there are many pieces of wood and pinecones left, so she pays people to go in and collect this for her.  She has been doing this business for approximately three years. Edith will invest this loan in a chainsaw because she and her husband also cut wood themselves.\r\n\r\nEdith\u2019s greatest motivation is to maintain the health and well-being of her family, especially of her three children who are 15, 11, and 10, because with only her husband\u2019s income they are unable to make ends meet. She is content working with Fondo Esperanza, because it has been a great support for her and for her business.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":553282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He has high hopes of supporting them and providing them with a successful future.  In one of the most commercial areas in central Barranquilla, Julio has a business where he offers detailed inlay services.\r\n<p>\r\nHe started his career by selling paintings.  Through this business, he gained experience and knowledge in the art of detailed inlays.

This business has helped his family move forward.\r\n<p>\r\nTo date, Julio has received five loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  The loans were used to finance his portfolio so that he could respond to the demands of his customers by offering a wide variety of designs.  One of his dreams is to organize a gallery where he can expand his market and effectively display his work so that his customers will be impacted.  His first loan through Kiva will be used to buy wood, nails, tacks, molds, and adhesives for making artwork that has already been requested.  Each investment he makes is based on the level of successful pre-sales he has completed.

Viene trabajando 25 a\u00f1os en sus propias tierras, y en tiempos de cosecha necesita el apoyo de jornaleros para avanzar con las extracciones de los frutos. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde la chacra hasta la ciudad de san francisco; lugar donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus granos de cacao. En adelante, desea comprar plantas de cacao para poder incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este ser\u00e1 su pr\u00e9stamo numero 08 con MFP, asimismo se siente agradecida con el apoyo que le brindan ya que as\u00ed puede continuar con su trabajo; al igual que en su banco comunal es puntual y responsable en las reuniones que se realiza. Con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado de 2,000 nuevos soles, podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s plantas de cacao para incrementar su cultivo.\n\n","en":"Catalina is 37, and married to Paulino, 36. They live in their own house, with their four children, who they do their very best for. Catalina, along with her husband is the support of the family.  \r\n\r\nFrom a very early age her parents taught her to work their small farm. Catalina is a hard-working woman who has a plot of land where she grows cacao. She has been working on her own land for 25 years, and at harvest times, she needs the help of day laborers to move forward with the extraction of the crops. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is harvesting her crops; since this way, she feels she is rewarded for the months of hard work by the quality of her crops. \r\n\r\nShe considers that the hardest part is transporting her crops from her small farm to the town of San Francisco, a place where they offer better prices for her cacao. In the future she wishes to buy cacao plants, in order to increase her production. \r\n\r\nThis will be her eighth loan with MFP, and she feels grateful for the support she is being offered, since this way she can continue working.  As well, in her communal bank she is on time and responsible in the meetings that are held. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 2,000 nuevos soles she is applying for, she will be able to buy more cacao plants in order to increase her crop.

Dari pengalaman yang lalu satu induk sapi dalam setahun hanya bisa melahirkan anak satu kali. Dan setelah  5 sampai 6 bulan akan bisa dijual. Harga anak sapi berbeda \u2013 beda sesuai dengan jenis kelaminnya. Jika anaknya jantan maka akan laku terjual lebih mahal dibandingkan sapi yang betina yang harganya berkisar Rp. 2.200.000.- sampai Rp. 2.500.000.- Jadi Jika Ni Komang Murni memelihara dua ekor induk sapi tentu dalam setahun bisa panen sebanyak dua kali dengan pendapatan yang lebih banyak lagi. Dan nantinya dari hasil penjualan sapi ini akan dipergunakan untuk biaya hidup mereka dan juga biaya sekolah anak \u2013anaknya kelak karena sekarang memang masih kecil dan belum

For the last ten years he has been working as an agriculturer harvesting taro root and cabbage.

She is very eager to improve her future, and for this reason she works hard every day selling milk. Her customers seek her out for her tasty, pure milk, because she takes a lot of care to select the milk she sells. She enjoys her work, as it allows her to spend a lot of time in the country with her animals and see that they are well fed. She has been in this business for nine years and hopes to have a place to sell her milk, since she currently acts as a traveling saleswoman and has to walk all day. This is the hardest and understandably the least pleasant part of her work, but she knows that the road to her personal development isn't easy and she is ready to face any difficulty that lies before her. This is Dolores's first loan with MFP. She knows that she must pay on time and is ready to save a little bit each day in order to do so.

She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through neighbors who also work with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy products (chicken, fish, soft drinks and other items) to increase her stock of merchandise. \r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to repay the loan as indicated and take out new loans later.

Now she is on pension and is engaged in cattle breeding.  \r\n\r\nJumabubu used her starting capital of 10,000 KGS to buy livestock for fattening and reselling. Thanks to her persistent and hard-working personality, she managed to enlarge the number of her livestock to five sheep, five goats, two cows and one horse. She sells milk to her customers at the local market and earns about 3,000 KGS monthly. With the revenues from livestock reselling, Jumabubu was able to  build up a barn and renovate her house. \r\n\r\nJumabubu plans to use this loan of 60,000 KGS to buy three calves and fifteen sheep.

The group is comprised of 10 members.  Cristina A. is one of them. She is 57 years old and sells vegetables, particularly <i>nopales<\/i> [prickly pear cactus].  She has eight children total: three girls and five boys.  Only one - a 16 year old boy who attends primary school - is still dependent on her.  Cristina is requesting this loan to buy <i>nopales<\/i>, as the price is currently high due to a scarcity of that product.  She would also like to begin cultivating her own crops in order to bring in a better income.  Most of her customers are from Atlacomulco, which is a place where people from different communities gather to buy whatever products they need.\r\n\r\nAs she requests this loan, Cristina feels very excited that she will be able to invest in her business.  She is a very hardworking person who does not give up in any situation; she faces anything with enthusiasm.  Her husband died recently but she knows that the way to get ahead is to provide her son with a good education.  She hopes that he will achieve his goals and that he will do well and act responsibly in whatever he does."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":674722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables (prickly pear cactus)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1694},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1737},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1828},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1972},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2023},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2075},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2128},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2182},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2239},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2296},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2355},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2415},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2476}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1187.62,"local_amount":14651,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":14672.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403439},{"amount":698.99,"local_amount":8623,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8635.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982081},{"amount":773.64,"local_amount":9544,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9557.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264129},{"amount":14.75,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":182.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232772181}],"funded_date":"2011-01-03T01:43:32Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":264779,"name":"Dennis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dennis B. is from the village of Quiling, Roxas, Isabela.

From there, she goes to her house, where she sets out a little table and starts selling.  She has been doing this work for a year, as before this, she did a variety of jobs, but they did not give her enough time with her children.

She is 35, and she lives in her own house with her two children, nine year old Samuel and seven year old Maria.  Her children are the motivation for all of her efforts.  When she was still very young she suffered the terrible loss of her parents.  From that moment on she knew that she was alone, and that if she wanted to have a better future she had to work very hard.  So, taking advantage of the land that her parents left her, she was able to set up a parking garage.  Her garage is one of the most used in the city of Puno.  What she likes most about her work is that she is able to do her household chores at the same time that she takes care of the cars.  She has been in this business for five years.

For the time being she and her husband are living with her in-laws, but she has hopes that they can start a new life together.  Since she doesn't her own fields, Marleny was loaned some by her mother, planted with coffee that's just about ready to be harvested, so she won't be without income.  Now she's waiting for the berries to ripen so she can harvest them, and in the meantime she's planting her own crops.\r\n\r\nFor her entire life Marleny has had a penchant for farming since she grew up in that environment.  Furthermore, she sees it as a very profitable business, and while it requires a big investment, that's all recouped at harvest time.  By planting her own produce she plans to save money to buy her own land and a plot where she can build her house.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Marleny hopes to have a thriving business in the city buying and selling fruits and vegetables.
