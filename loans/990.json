Her parents-in-law are provided with a retirement pension. The family can be esteemed to belong to the vulnerable poor category. Natela used to have a small poultry farm, but the hens died of fowl plague. \r\n\r\nNow she has requested a loan for re-starting the farm. She received the loan in the framework of a start-up loan program, initiated jointly by Credo and Kiva. This program aims at provision of business start-up or business re-start credits to Georgian rural poor who do not have access to regular credit products, as they live in poverty and are regarded as \u201cborrowers with high risk of default\u201d. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit, Natela will purchase chickens and raise them. The other part of the loan will be used for purchasing feed for chickens.  After 4-5 months, she will start the sale of hens. The hens will be sold on the local open market. \r\n\r\nShe will reinvest the profit for further expansion of the farm. Also, part of the profit will be used for purchasing necessary household goods, to improve her living conditions, and finance the education of her children. She awaits your

One of Marjorie's goals is to have a bazaar in her home so that she can attend to her customers more calmly and show all of her merchandise and generate more income so that she can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMarjorie lives with her husband and their four children who are 3, 5, 10, and 12 years old.  Her dream for her business is to have her bazaar, and her dreams for her family are that her children do well and have a good future so that they can get a good job after their studies.  She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has provided since it has allowed her to invest in her business.  She feels very comfortable with the company of the other entrepreneurs in her community bank since they share different activities and interests which have served as a moment of distraction.  She has learned how to administer her business better in the trainings provided at meetings.  \r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region, which is located in the central part of the country.  It is the administrative, economic, and culture center of the region and the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  In Chile there is a curious reference to Talca in the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London\". Some say this is a derivation of the original phrase spoken by an Englishman, \"Talca seems like London\" because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1227478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She explained to the group three advantages of a Fresh Life toilet: it is clean, it is a profitable business opportunity, and it will improve sanitation in the community. With Jackline\u2019s leadership, the group has decided to make their first investment the operation of a Fresh Life toilet. \r\n\r\nJackline\u2019s group dreams of being able to purchase a Fresh Life toilet for every part of their neighborhood and eventually making enough profit so that the members can buy plots of land of their own.

His parent\u2019s house locates in a boundary area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity. Batzorig has been renting a cell phone repair counter and sells phone spare parts in the downtown area of the city for 7 years. Every six months, he goes to China\u2019s nearest border to buy phone spare parts. \r\n\r\nHis wife is a student, but this year she is not studying because she is pregnant and will give birth in November. As he and his wife are expecting a baby, Batzorig has been building a new house on the land of his parents for his family and the house is 80% complete. The loan Batzorig is taking will be used to buy radiators and insulate the roof, floor, and walls with energy saving materials in order to stop the heat loss. If his new house will be warmer, less energy will be burnt. By doing this he and his family will improve their living condition and can cut the usage of coal to warm his house.

group and is the group\u2019s leader. Turgungubu is 44 years old; her husband died prematurely in 2008. Turgungubu has brought up four children. Now she has two school-age children in her care. Her eldest son is married and works in Russia. Turgungbubu has received secondary education. After finishing high school, she got married.  When the collective farm system was dissolved and she received a land plot, she started growing produce. At present the family continues to grow produce and raise livestock; they work 1,85 ha [about 4,5 acres] of land. Turgunbubu is a very active and hard-working person by nature. Having to face many challenges on her own after her husband\u2019s death, Turgunbubu  persevered thanks to remaining goal-oriented and calm. Turgunbubu has turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS intended to buy livestock. In the future, Turgunbubu plans to expand her livestock and improve her family\u2019s live conditions. Her goal in life is to raise children and grandchildren, making sure her children receive a good secondary education and later on have an opportunity for university studies.

She is the mother of four children. Her husband and her brother help her in managing her business. \r\n\r\nCurrently Cholpon is engaged in trade of fruit at the local market. She started her business in 2006 with 10,000 som (KGS). Cholpon's monthly income is around 15,000 - 20,000 som (KGS). She is a person of very honest and purposeful character. Everything she has achieved has been due to her hard work. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further expand her business, Cholpon turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of fruit for reselling, seeing the fruit prices are lower in the fall. With the proceeds, Cholpon is going to improve her living conditions. She told us that she would like to increase her turnover and in the future purchase a house in the city of Tokmok.

","en":"Cristina, 35, is part of a group called \u201cAbejitas Trabajadoras\u201d (Little Worker Bees).  She comments that they named their group thus because they feel bees are very intelligent, hardworking little animals and that\u2019s why they chose that name for their group.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s married to Edgar who is a carpenter and they have three children who she says are her joy and the reason to move forward.  She relates that she has a business manufacturing furniture like bedroom sets, tables, chairs, dining room sets, chests of drawers, armoires and many other things she makes and sells.  She relates that her husband taught her how to cut, sand and paint the wood and to sell them in a locale they have alongside a highway.  She says that she\u2019s had the business about 8 years and thanks to it she and her family have been able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe says that the wood she uses to make the furniture is delivered to her workshop and the wood she uses the most is pine and conglomerate (pressed sawdust).  She says that she and her husband sell the furniture in a locale and sometimes she goes out to sell it in communities adjacent to her town on credit so that customers can afford to make the payments.\r\n\r\nShe says that she\u2019s asking Vision Fund for a loan to buy varnish they apply to the furniture which is what they most need right now because she currently has several pieces of furniture still unvarnished for lack of capital because sometimes her customers don\u2019t follow through with their payments and she does not have the wherewithal to buy supplies.\r\n\r\nCristina\u2019s goal is to make her business grow.  She says that she\u2019d like her business to grow so that when she\u2019s no longer here she can leave her children a stable business.  \r\n\r\nThe other eleven group members are called Elizabeth, Rosa, Mariana, Jorge, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana de Jes\u00fas, Teresa, Georgina, Nubia, Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Jaime.

They identify themselves with this name because the members are from the Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood, which they celebrate during the month of June.\r\n\r\nBlanca Luz is the one who was interviewed.  She was born in Cop\u00ednala in the month of August in 1951.  She attended school until the third year of high school.  She got married when she was 17, and she has four children, who are all now married.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to her food business.  She has been working in the business for nine years and two months.  She says that it is going well for her because she, herself, goes out and takes orders to sell and deliver to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe started this business activity because she also likes to contribute income to her household.  This way she helps with some of the expenses that are generated daily.  She is a single woman, and she depends solely upon her business.\r\n\r\nHer motive for this business activity is to have her own money.  Her husband was in bad health, and he could no longer work.  That is why she decided to devote her time to something that left her with income.  What she wishes is to manage to get ahead in her business as long as God gives her life.  She wants to use the income that she is getting to improve the place where she sells.\r\n\r\nThe people who comprise the group are:  \r\n\r\nLorena del Carmen:  Will invest in buying and selling soft drinks\r\nSandra:  Will invest in buying materials for her beauty salon\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1226230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for making food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T00:30:20Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena  Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":497.56,"local_amount":6426.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6474.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120080},{"amount":720.05,"local_amount":9300.63,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9370.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068126},{"amount":480.34,"local_amount":6204.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6250.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284864},{"amount":480.5,"local_amount":6206.42,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6252.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199157},{"amount":221.55,"local_amount":2861.71,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595968}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T10:48:54Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":489778,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 34 years old, married and supports a family of six dependents.

She is 36 years old, is single, and is a university student. According to Paulina, she opened her own business because it was difficult to find some other kind of work. A little over five years ago, she set up a small grocery store from her home. As time passed, her business has grown and she recently built a small shop where her store is located now. Paulina has many clients and she says that what she likes best about her business, besides earning her own money, is that she is constantly in contact with people and she has been able to make good friendships. \r\n\r\nPaulina's store is open every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. She always gives her customers a good deal because this helps to ensure repeat purchases.

Lim\u00f3n\" group in on its second loan cycle with this microfinance organization and is made up of three women who speak the Zoque language and live in a community called San Isidro. Ms. Paulina, who completed the interview, is 36 years-old and was born in the village of Ocotepec. She only completed elementary school and got married to Alberto when she was 15 years-old. They have four children, who are still dependent on them. Paulina invested her last loan in raising poultry, but that didn't earn her a good enough return. That's why she's now planning to invest this loan in a snack food enterprise, and thus be able to put the investment to better use. She was inspired to go into this line of business by her mother, who has been urging her to commit to a trade that can earn her a better income and has offered her a small spot from where she can start selling her foods. Paulina's dream is to be able to go on working and save up to buy materials for putting a roof on her family's house. The other members of the group are Ms. Marcelina, who will invest in some plastic goods, and Mr. Florida who will invest in buying and selling clothing. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1226231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for preparing food items.

She is married to Federico, who is a day laborer, and they have 2 children.  One of their children is in high school and the other attends middle school.  Amulfa belongs to the communal bank named \"Un Nuevo Resplandor\" (A New Radiance).  She says that they gave the group this name because the loans have really helped them out a lot.  She says \"thanks to the Vision Fund, my business and the businesses of my fellow group members have improved because we have capital to invest and put to work.  This way we can pay off the loan and also improve conditions for our families.  I thank the lender in the name of my companions and myself for helping us.\"  \r\n\r\nAmulfa says that she has been making embroidered garments for 12 years.  She started out making napkins, but later the people in her town were seeing the pretty things she was making, and how well-embroidered they were, and they started making orders with her.  She decided to start to sell in her town, and then later she was selling in the markets in the communities surrounding her town.  In addition, she raises turkeys and sheep.  \r\n\r\nAmulfa says that she is requesting a loan from Vision Fund to  buy material such as marquesa fabric, embroidery hoops, needles, ribbons, yarn, thread, hooks and thick yarn to make scarves, hats, and other knitted items for the winter season.  This is when she sells the most of these types of garments.  She says that a year ago, she made winter garments and the sales were very good, especially the sets of scarves, hats and gloves.  She says that she buys her raw materials in different stores in a nearby town.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are named Feliciana, Maria Marcela, and Pascacia.  They will invest in their businesses cultivating maguey catci to extract \"aguamiel\" (a beverage), buying supplies to make embroidered handicrafts, and buying animal feed so that they can raise sheep to sell.

Every day, Yamrid hauls passengers and also agricultural products to be sold in the city. Recently, Yamrid had an idea to buy all these products from his passengers and resell them in the market. It can help the passengers to reduce their transportation cost while helping him earn more income. To get the loan assistance, Yamrid went to TLM and requested a loan of IDR. 5,000,000.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Baktygul received her share of her collective farm and began working primarily in raising livestock and farming.  She started this business with 30,000 Som.  Thanks to her hard work, Baktygul now has one dairy cow with a calf and one heifer on her farm.  The monthly income from her business is about 5,000 Som.  In order to develop her business further, Baktygul has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to purchase livestock she can raise and sell.  She plans to use the proceeds from her loan to increase her head of livestock so she can save for the education of her younger son, who is now 16 years old.  In the future, Baktygul plans to buy a house in the village for her son, so that in her old age she can easily take care her

","en":"Mamlekat is 55 years old, widowed and the mother of two children.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, she received her share of a collective farm.  As her main source of income, Mamlekat has begun to raise livestock and grow crops, a business she started with 30,000 Som.  She is a very interesting, good-natured and responsible person.  Thanks to her hard work, Mamlekat's farm is now in very good condition.  Her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren help her with the farm, which generates a monthly income of 10,000-15,000 Som.  To develop her business further, Mamlekat has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy a cow and a bull to feed and resell.  She plans to use the proceeds from the loan to further increase her head of livestock so she can begin saving money to improve her living conditions by making repairs on her farm.

forming a non-profit organization but said there is normally a higher inconsistency rate as there is not enough room to direct, which hinders a successful process. \r\n\r\nKings, Queens & Scholars Magazine, which focuses on excellence in education, quickly sold out on its first day of publication in 1994, but its success ended in 1999 when Silvestre was promoted in his career as a Federal officer. \u201cWith the constant traveling, I didn't have time to dedicate to my publication,\u201d he says. Silvestre funded the magazine because he saw students and parents needed assistance and guidance during their exiting years of high school. \r\n\r\nThe original format focused on academia instead of sports, but when considering rekindling the magazine, Silvestre decided to include sports and incorporate stories written by educators, attorneys, dentists and other professionals sharing how they continued their education to obtain their jobs. Silvestre says this process helps students by reinforcing the importance of staying in school and continuing after graduation. \u201cWe\u2019re valley wide ranging from South Padre Island to Rio Grande City,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the majority of the magazine\u2019s content derives from journalism students, which gives them an opportunity to publish their work and gives Silvestre the ability to completely cover the valley. Silvestre employs a photographer, who also teaches, a design graduate who works on the design elements and his son as the publisher and computer technician. \u201cWe do a lot for the community\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re helping and guiding students, teachers, and parents with information about colleges, scholarships and the like,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s to help the community. This is our way of thanking everyone who has helped us, and giving back to the community.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Accion Texas Inc. from The Harlingen Economic Development Corporation and the City of Harlingen, Silvestre contacted Accion for a loan. He says the loan will tremendously assist the magazine in a very positive way as he was able to purchase computers, cameras, chargers, batteries and a printer to continue production. The magazine is published bi-monthly.

This will lead to having more produce and hence more income that will help him improve his living standards in future. He plans to have bought a more productive cow in the next five years.\r\n\r\nCompetition and lack of a readily available market for his produce is his main challenge in farming.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1225243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her biggest desire has been to give the best to her children, and it is for them that she gets up every morning hoping to move up in life and overcome the violent society that surrounds her. She currently sells cosmetics and beauty supplies. In this way, alongside her husband, they are able to provide the daily bread. She has regular customers who seek her out at home to buy her products, making her seem like a great saleswoman and entrepreneur. She wishes to have more products in stock since she only manages a small product line with diverse options. It's for this reason she is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Apoyo Integral, so she can be closer to her dream of having her own small store that is profitable and not in her home. She plans to purchase more creams, perfumes, lipsticks, eye shadows and a wide range of other cosmetics. She hopes to receive your help and at the same time promises to make her payments on time.

This was how the idea for toilet seat covers in surgical fabric was born which then led to gowns and hospital bed covers that are used in clinics and hospitals.  Her goal is to become a massive distributor via coin-operated dispensers to new supermarkets, to air and ground transportation terminals and various other sites where the public congregates.\r\n\r\nHer sales take place daily and are cash and her production and sales process lasts from 8am until 6pm.  She\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan to buy five dispensers to generate a higher sales volume in very busy public sites thus improving her income yet again.  Her goal for later on is to cover the Caribbean coast and then extend throughout Colombia with her product whose sale is increasing bit by

Her dreams for her family and for herself include owning a house so that she can provide for children\u2019s welfare.  \r\n<p>\r\nElsa is very pleased and appreciative of the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her.  She says that there is good communication within the organization.  With regard to the training, Elsa has learned new sales strategies and accounting techniques.  \r\n<p>\r\nTalca is in the region of Maule and is located in the central part of the country. It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region and is one of the most important cities in the Chilean Central Valley. One curious reference to Talca that is used in Chile is the phrase, \u201cTalca, Paris, and London\u201d. Some say that the phrase was originally attributed to an Englishman who said, \u201cTalca feels like London\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city during winter, just like in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1227486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy butter, flour, eggs, and oil as well as clothing to sell.

She is 46 years old and a widow.  Elmira has one 17 year-old son, who helps her with the household.  She shows herself as a calculated and smart person.  Besides this, Elmira can run her business well.  Animal husbandry is the primary source of income for the family.  Her disability pension serves as an additional source of income.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Elmira's family got involved in animal husbandry.  This business helped feed the family during those difficult years of perestroika.  She has been running her business for 20 years.  Elmira's starting capital amounted to 10,000 KGS.  Since that time, the family has tried to improve its living conditions and increase livestock headcount. Today, the family's monthly income amounts to 10,000-15,000 som (KGS), and the business contains three cows and two calves.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock at a lower price.  Elmira's plans are to improve the family's welfare and increase livestock headcount.

She is 51 years old, a widow and raised four children.  Her oldest son left to work in the Russian Federation, two daughters are married, and the youngest daughter works in Osh.  Erkeiym obtained a secondary-specialized education and shows herself as a very conscientious and decent person.  Besides this, Erkeiym is able to organize her business at a high level.  Animal husbandry is the primary source of income for the family.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Erkeiym's family got involved in animal husbandry.  This business helped feed the family even during those difficult years of perestroika.  Erkeiym's starting capital amounted to practically 0 som.  Since that time, the family has tried to improve its living conditions and increase livestock headcount.  Today, the family's monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS), and the business contains two cows.  In order to further expand her business, Erkeiym requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock at a lower price.  Erkeiym's plans are to improve the family's welfare and to purchase a land plot in the

Sus ventas las realiza de contado, diariamente y tambi\u00e9n a cr\u00e9dito, a una clientela conformada entre amigos, vecinos y referidos por estos. Su meta mas adelante es tener instalaciones independientes y de mayor tama\u00f1o, pero su mayor desaf\u00edo para cumplirla a corto plazo, es que su capital de trabajo no es suficiente  para lograrlo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, con el cual ,comprar\u00e1 cosm\u00e9ticos, calzado, perfumer\u00eda, productos de belleza  como tintes, esmaltes etc. Mientras todo esto ocurre Yerid se esmera trabajando con el fin de convertir sus sue\u00f1os en realidad, apoy\u00e1ndose en primera instancia en este   financiamiento, con el que prevee tener \u00e9xito, porque ocurre en una \u00e9poca de mucho movimiento comercial, donde la clientela tiene dinero disponible por efecto de primas y bonificaciones laborales y a ella usualmente le va muy bien en esta temporada.. \n \n","en":"Yarid, 35, is married and has two young children, ages 2 and 4. She is a merchant and a beauty stylist who lives in the town of Soledad, in the metropolitan area of the city of Barranquilla. She has 2 years experience selling cosmetics and perfumes, and applying beauty treatments. With her business she has earned the income to support the well-being of her family. \r\n\r\nYarid went from being employed to starting her own business once she decided to be independent, offering consumer beauty products and services. Her sales are made daily, in cash and also by credit, to a clientele made up of friends, neighbors and referrals. Her goal is to later have larger, independent facilities, but her biggest challenge in the short term is not having enough working capital to achieve it.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is requesting a loan from credikiva, with which she will buy cosmetics, shoes, perfumes, beauty products like dyes, nail polish, etc. Along the way, Yarid strives to turn her dreams into reality, relying in the first place on this financing, which she foresees as a success because it comes at a time of a lot of commercial activity. The customers have money to spend because of premiums and bonuses from work, and she usually does very well during this season.\r\n

Her oldest son is married and so is her daughter.  Rahima has a secondary education.  She got married after finishing school.  After the breakup of a collective farm, she got her plot of land and got involved in farming and animal husbandry.  She has been involved in business for a long time - about 20 years.  She started her business with 60,000 KGS.  Currently, the family continues to be involved in farming and animal husbandry and have one cow.  Selling milk from home is Rahima's secondary source of income.  The family's monthly income amounts to about 10,000 KGS.  Rahima is a very active and hardworking person.  Following her husband's death and being left alone with all problems, Rahima was able to live through it all, thanks to her sense of purpose and calmness.  Rahima requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  She plans to buy three cows.  In the future, Rahima plans to increase livestock headcount and improve living conditions.  Her goal in life is to marry off her son and raise grandchildren.

She and her husband have one son.  Her husband and son help Gulmira with running the business.  Currently, she is involved in selling food products at her small store.  She started her business with 20,000 som in 1993.  Gulmira's monthly income amounts to about 15,000-20,000 som.  She is a very honest and goal-oriented person.  After the breakup of the USSR, Gulmira and her husband were left in a difficult predicament, as collective farms fell apart and widespread privatization started.  Everything that she has achieved was achieved thanks to her love of hard work.  In order to further expand her business, she requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase food products for subsequent resale.  Gulmira plans to use the resulting income to improve her living conditions.  She said that her plans are to increase product turnover and repair her apartment in the future.

Esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 desde hace 7 a\u00f1os cuando trabajaba en otro negocio similar y desde principios de este a\u00f1o decidi\u00f3 independizarse y emprenderla.

She sells food, supplies, sodas and drinks in a store located in her home. She learned how to run the business seven years ago when she was working in another similar establishment. At the beginning of this year, she decided to open her own store. She makes cash sales and sell portions that her customers are able to purchase according to their family's income.\r\n\r\nCurrently Luz is applying for a loan in order to buy products which have a quick turnover, such as supplies, in volume so that she will always have an inventory available.\r\n\r\nAlthough Luz has had other businesses selling merchandise, she decided seven months ago to open this store because she identified a need customers had for a market and also her own need to address her duties as a housewife, such as taking care of her home, while also generating an income that would help her family. Her greatest challenge is acquiring sufficient working capital so that she can achieve the business growth she wants, however with her persistence she will surely do so.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1228173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies in greater volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T19:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T19:20:13Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Divina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65820},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70623},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72271},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":73957},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75683},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77449},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79256},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84941}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":65820,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":70358.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994493},{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":70623,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":75493.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519674},{"amount":42.16,"local_amount":72271,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":77254.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071516},{"amount":43.14,"local_amount":73957,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":79057.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497731},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":75683,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527542},{"amount":45.18,"local_amount":77449,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":82789.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928302},{"amount":95.78,"local_amount":164197,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":175520.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732286}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T12:33:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":490460,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma works hard to support her family.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el fin de comprar ropa exterior e interior, cosm\u00e9ticos y perfumer\u00eda en general,  as\u00ed como accesorios femeninos. Su meta mas adelante es especializarse en ropa y tener un almac\u00e9n donde exhibirla y muy seguramente con su trabajo esmerado lo va a conseguir. \n \n","en":"Kelly, 31, is a clothes merchant specializing in women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s sportswear; she sells by means of specialized catalogues that she uses to promote her wares.  She sells both for cash and on credit to her customers who are both stores and individuals.  She supports her home composed of her spouse and 12-year-old daughter, who she hopes to see become a successful professional, with her business.  Kelly has 15 years\u2019 experience in her business and her husband started her out in this activity which he knows very well; she\u2019s a very enthusiastic person.\r\n\r\nHer main products are shorts, skirts, blouses and other items in her catalogues like cosmetics, perfumery, kitchen items, etc.  Her main challenge at present is working capital because it\u2019s insufficient to meet end-of-year demand, a season when everyone wants to be well-dressed to spend the holidays with their families.  There is also much ready cash on-hand due to employee bonuses and gifts.\r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy outerwear and underwear, cosmetics and perfumery in general as well as women\u2019s accessories.  Her goal for later on is to specialize in clothes and to have a store to display it; undoubtedly she\u2019ll succeed in doing so with her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1228197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes, cosmetics and perfumery in general.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":172369},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":181664},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":185903},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":190241},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":194680},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":205143}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.34,"local_amount":172369,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":174705.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130823},{"amount":100.48,"local_amount":181664,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":184126.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071521},{"amount":102.82,"local_amount":185903,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":188422.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497736},{"amount":3.3,"local_amount":5971,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6051.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527547},{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":233637,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":236803.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817595},{"amount":193.84,"local_amount":350456,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":355205.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323908}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T12:46:30Z","paid_date":"2013-11-02T09:14:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":491263,"name":"Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Socorro compr\u00f3 materias primas e insumos, con los cuales fabric\u00f3 prendas de vestir de maternidad.

She is married to Jun, a jeepney operator, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarceline oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one 4-16 person capacity jeepney, which pays her a boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarceline dreams of giving her family a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.
