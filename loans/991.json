She is originally from a place full of the rich history of Mexico. Also very close to there is the sanctuary of the monarch butterflies, where year after year the butterflies arrive from Canada, producing an unequaled spectacle.  Her area presents itself as one of the principal tourist attractions of Mexico, offering beautiful natural landscapes, where a typical provincial atmosphere can be experienced, where traditions and customs are preserved, and where there is a great variety of gastronomy to delight the most demanding palate. Lupita, as her friends call her, is part of the group called \"Poetas\" (Poets).\n\nShe has had a sandwich business for a little more than a year, and she says that she embarked on this business to be able to contribute something to her household and so that it would not be so difficult for her husband to support their son in his education, since he is in secondary school and the expenses are very substantial. She also says that she set up the business to have a productive activity where she would feel useful, and this is why she set up her sandwich shop. She is applying to Vision Fund for a loan to buy the ingredients that she needs in her business, such as rolls, mayonnaise, cream, vegetables such as avocados, onions, tomatoes, and peppers in vinegar, and some soda. She says that if she receives the loan, her business will improve and thus she will be able to have more sales, and this makes her very happy, since she wants to improve to thus be able to give her son a better quality of life. Lupita's goal is to set up her own location, since the place where she sells now is rented, and they charge her something dear for the rent. For this reason, she wants her own place. \n\nThe other 12 members of the group are Guadalupe, Rodrigo, Irma, Ricarda, Teresa, Eduardo, Beatriz, Elizabeth, Maria Alejandra, Pablo, Janet, and Roberto.

He works in the construction industry in Mexico City. \r\n\r\nShe is part of the group Union y Amistad [Unity and Friendship] and says that they chose this name for their group because they are very united, and when someone can't make their payment, they help each other to be able to get the payment and not lose face. \r\n\r\nFor more than four years she has been selling baby clothing and women's underwear, as well as stockings and women's socks. She says that this business took root when she saw that the women who come to her mother-in-law, who is a midwife, for an emergency consultation for help giving birth, they didn't come prepared with clothing for the baby or for themselves. They weren't ready. So it occurred to her to start selling baby clothing like small blankets, diapers, pants, bibs, baby outfits, rompers, and socks, and women's panties, pants, jackets, shoes and sanitary napkins that are used when they're going to give birth. She says that she likes her job a lot, because this way she can be devoted to her small children. \r\n\r\nShe stocks up on clothing in the cities of Toluca and Mexico in different stores where they give her lower prices, so she makes a better profit. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from Visi\u00f3n Fund in order to grow her business a little more, and already even neighbors from her community come and buy socks for their children's school from her. Marisol says, \"I like what I sell because this way I can contribute something and I can buy what I want for my children, and help my husband with the bills. Also I'm happy to belong to this group and already I have done several cycles; they always treat us very well and have the lowest interest rates.\" \r\n\r\nThe other six members of the group are Lidia, Ofelia, Fabi\u00e1n, Gilberta, Sandra and Juan Carlos. They will invest in goods for different purposes: to sell in a school store; in the purchase of surgical material and medicine for sale; for the purchase of feed and lambs; for the purchase of fertilizer and peach and avocado plants to grow; and for the purchase of seasonal fruits and vegetables to sell.

His wife is Liberty, a midwife. Together with his wife, Carme manages their household while operating a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns a profit by purchasing inventory at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house, and his regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales each day. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his family\u2019s everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, Carme is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. He will use the money to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages that will expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his income as he expands his business. He hopes to be able to expand further in the near future.

She is married to Santiago, a heavy equipment operator, and is a mother. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMa. Leonora oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business (please see footnote). She has a one unit jeepney (14-16 person capacity), which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Leonora dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n- Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1227220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-31T04:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-30T04:00:41Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

He continues to grow corn and beans while his wife manages the convenience store.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 6,000 HNL that he is requesting from ODEF, Ra\u00fal wants to grow his business by restocking it with more products.  He plans to buy basic grains, salt, coffee, soap, detergent, eggs, shortening, sugar, soft drinks, snacks, condiments, medicines, and other products.  His goal is to build an adjoining room to his house so that he can relocate his business, which is currently set up in his living room.  This will enable him to provide better service to his customers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1228160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic grains, salt, coffee, soap, detergent, eggs, shortening, sugar, soft drinks, snacks, condiments, medicines, and other products.

She also receives income from renting out a house. She describes her major challenge as a lack of enough capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to buy different types of clothing for resale.

She is married with 3 children between the ages of 1 and 8.  One of her children is currently attending school. In 2003, Isatu established her shop selling clothes and perfumes. She began her business because she wants her family's life to improve. She works at the business every day, 13 hours per day. At present, she is faced with insufficient capital to expand her business.  She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation costs and competition in the market. \r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy similar items such as blouses, jeans, and perfumes to add to her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to start a savings account and increase her business. In the future, Isatu plans to expand her business and employ staff. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1227397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

This is 23-year-old Kadiatu from Moriba town, Bo, Southern area. She is a married mother of one child age 4 years. She began her business because she did not go to school, and her husband's income is not enough to support the home.\r\n\r\nKadiatu runs a local products business; she sells palm oil, native rice and pepper. She has been running this business for three years. She works at the business every day, 12 hours per day. Her other source of income comes from a small-scale business. Kadiatu says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to invest in her business and an improper business location.\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to purchase more palm oil and native rice. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her status. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a shop level. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1227418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He would like to buy raw materials such as clay, wire and paint. He has been selling through NOVICA since 2009. This is his story: \r\n\r\n\"I stepped into the world of ceramic arts when I was 12 years old. Back then, my family's economic situation was difficult, so after school, my brother David and I would learn this craft and get paid a small amount. However, we were immediately taken by the artistry and its techniques. There was a teacher from school who was also going through some financial difficulties, so he set up a little workshop in his house and that extra money helped him put his own children through school. Then I went to Juana Velazquez' workshop and that's when I really began to learn the art of ceramics. I stayed at this workshop for 12 years, but a year before I left this great artisan died of cancer. She was like family to us, and we stood by her husband during this difficult time. I started my own workshop when I was 27 years old, and here is where I practice all I learned, always enjoying the beauty of Mexican ceramic artistry.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I began helping out in a jewelry workshop when I was 15, during school vacations. Little by little, this activity became a passion. I realized how much I enjoyed working with meticulous details, and eventually found a great deal of satisfaction in creating jewelry that people liked. Beauty can be expressed in different forms and manners. The challenge for a country like Peru is to get ahead little by little, despite the many difficult circumstances that exist. It's important that people appreciate the art of jewelry, as many don't value the effort it requires.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful for your support as I create my jewelry designs. This has been my passion since I was a young man, and it has brought me great satisfaction. It's wonderful to see how the simplest design becomes beautiful when worn by a woman.

Her interest in various ethnic cultures and ethnic products further developed when she began to experience more and more various types of cultures while coordinating and participating in swap meets and yard sales.   \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Candace was put on work disability, and in order to supplement her income, she decided to combine her passion for retail and culture by opening Ethnicity\u2019s Unique Boutique.  \r\n\r\nHer home-based business began to grow and she tapped into business educational resources through the Entrepreneur Academy at the Southeastern Economic Development Corporation (SEDC).  Through the SEDC, Candace learned about Accion\u2019s microloan program and was able to secure a loan to purchase a computer and additional inventory.   Since then, Candace has repaid her first Accion loan and has expanded her business into a retail storefront in San Diego.  \r\n\r\nCandace would like to further expand her business by attracting new customers through a storefront improvement process and marketing campaigns. Candace will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to make much needed storefront improvements, design new marketing materials and build a website.   \r\n\r\nShe hopes that these improvements will allow her to continue to enhance her community\u2019s rich cultural diversity through the unique ethnic art, home d\u00e9cor and accessories she offers at her store. \r\n\r\nCheck out her Facebook page at:

She is married to Rommel and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Grace operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Grace hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Neil, a policeman, and she is a mother.  Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArnelfa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP loan of 30,000. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArnelfa hopes to expand her business, and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and she draws strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1227625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They have three children who are attending a primary school in Santo Domingo, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo of Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador that has in recent years had a sustained population growth. The capital is a city where the most attractive and appealing of its benefits are its delicious fruits and the rich cuisine that can be found in this region.  It also has considerable trade, as it has become a commercial hub between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country.  The city also has many tourist attractions that together with its warm climate make this an attractive destination for both domestic and foreign tourists. That is why most of the residents engage in a commercial activity.\r\n\r\nOne of these entrepreneurs is Ram\u00f3n, who more than 4 years ago decided to take the plunge to engage in the sale of household and personal care goods, and he learned how to do this work through practical experience, which he gained during the course of 10 years of door to door street sales, walking down the main streets and roads of the city.  At this time, he wants to also engage with the rural sector to increase his customer base and generate more sales.  Ram\u00f3n has been a client of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a year, and he is satisfied with the advice they give and the facility of gaining loan approval.  That's why he now requires a loan to buy merchandise that would allow him to diversify the types of products he carries. Ram\u00f3n hopes that with this increase in his business, he will be able to gain enough revenue to build his savings and build a home with decent

","en":"William is a 32 year old man with a primary school education.  He is married to Martha, 32, and they have a 7 year old daughter named Heidi.  They live in Latacunga, capital of the Cotopaxi province, one of the provinces that form part of the Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador.  In recent years, Latacunga has developed so remarkably that it is considered one of the most important towns of the region thanks to the floral, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture, and livestock industries.  In addition, there are business establishments that generate interesting income, making it a commercial city offering many opportunities to get ahead.  In this city, many of the festivals retain the deep roots and purity very close to historic origins and ancestral traditions.  These celebrations beckon people from across the country, turning this city into the meeting point of the provinces.  Latacunga is the home of construction materials that are distributed from here to across the country.\r\n\r\nWilliam has been making cement blocks for 13 years.  He learned how to manage this business thanks to the support of his family who has always been engaged in this business.  He puts in eight hours a day and his wife helps him.  He believes that mixing all of the ingredients is hard work and for this reason, when he has free time, he helps his colleagues from other \u201cbloqueras\u201d with their activities.  He has experienced several losses during his years in business, the first due to theft of his blocks and materials, and the second because of irresponsible customers who hadn\u2019t paid on time.  However, William has gotten ahead and provided his wife and daughter with a good lifestyle.  Now, he needs a loan to purchase materials in order to increase brick production and add to his profits.  This will allow him to give his daughter the education that he himself could not enjoy.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa provided him with the flexibility and confidence to obtain this loan. In addition, they have provided him with personal advice in the proper management of his resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1220980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

She has several years of experience working in the area, and has gained a lot of experience that allows her to earn more money. Her small chicken farm is in her home. She sells in all the areas of the community since she has many customers that prefer her to other sellers. This is because she always fills their needs with high-quality products at reasonable prices, but above all because of her excellent service.\r\n\r\nMarta is a woman who is very dedicated to her work, very humble, energetic, and is a fighter.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nOlivia hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

viven en La Concordia, un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas que anteriormente pertenec\u00eda a la Provincia de Esmeraldas. Es considerado un cant\u00f3n muy fuerte en la agroindustria y exportaci\u00f3n de varios productos como palma africana, macadamia y palmito por lo cual un aproximado de m\u00e1s de 300 millones de d\u00f3lares se mueven solo en este cant\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una fuente de econom\u00eda, pues hay lugares que son visitados y los habitantes del pueblo aprovechan este movimiento para comercializar todo tipo de productos con negocios establecidos en cada rinc\u00f3n como restaurantes, tiendas, farmacias, almacenes de ropa, tours, etc. Sin embargo en \u00e9poca de invierno, grandes porciones de terreno y plantaciones se ven afectadas por las fuertes e inevitables lluevan que llegan al lugar. Las p\u00e9rdidas que se presentan en esta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o muchas veces son irreparables, pues muchas familias viven en construcciones de ca\u00f1a muy d\u00e9biles para resistir las torrentes aguas. \nA pesar de esto, los ciudadanos de este cant\u00f3n no se dan por vencidos y para remediar de alguna forma las p\u00e9rdidas, contin\u00faan trabajando buscando oportunidades para salir adelante de alguna forma, por lo cual son considerados personas emprendedoras en todo \u00e1mbito como lo es Carlos quien se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de maracuy\u00e1 y cacao frutas muy cotizadas a nivel nacional e internacional. Lleva 2 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y ha adquirido mucha experiencia sobre todo porque dedica al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en las labores de sembrar, cosechar, preservar, fumigar y cuidar los cultivos de estas plantas. Su padre fue quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a buscar el sustento de esta forma y adem\u00e1s le brinda su ayuda en lo que pueda. Carlos se siente preparado para avanzar un paso m\u00e1s en este emprendimiento y cree que es posible un incremento de ingresos con la adquisici\u00f3n de semillas e insumos que le permitan incrementar su producci\u00f3n y por ende, la oferta para sus clientes.

Ellos le atendieron con mucho carisma y agilidad lo que le dio confianza y adem\u00e1s proyecci\u00f3n pues las capacitaciones que all\u00ed brindan son de mucha utilidad para los microempresarios de la zona. Con estos ingresos extras Carlos piensa separar un ahorro que en el futuro pueda sustentarle para comprar un terreno grande donde pueda ampliar sus cultivos y as\u00ed brindar la mejor educaci\u00f3n y calidad de vida a sus hijos.","en":"Carlos, 26, went to high school. He has two children, ages 5 and 3, with whom he lives in La Concordia, a canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas which used to be part of the province of Esmeraldas. It's considered a strong region for agriculture and export of products like African palm, macadamia nuts, and palm hearts, which bring in more than $300 million dollars in this canton alone. Tourism is also part of the economy, as the locals in the visited areas take advantage of the tourists to sell all kinds of products, with businesses like restaurants, stores, pharmacies, clothing stores, tours, etc on every corner. Nevertheless, in winter a lot of the land and plantations are affected by the strong and inevitable rains that arrive here. The losses that they are facing in this season of the year are often irreparable, since many families live in structures made of sugar cane that are too week to resist the torrential rains.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, the residents of this canton will not give up, and they will keep working to make up for the losses as much as possible, looking for opportunities to get ahead in some way. They are widely considered to be determined people, like Carlos, who grows passion fruit and cacao which are very sought-after at a national and international level. He has been doing this for two years and has acquired a lot of experience, above all because he works at least 8 hours a day planting, harvesting, preserving, fumigating and caring for the crops. His father taught him to earn a living this way, and helps him as he is able. Carlos feels prepared to take his business a step further and believes it's possible to increase his income by buying seeds and inputs that will let him increase his production and therefore the supply for his customers. \r\n\r\nFor that reason he has asked for a loan from Fundacion Alternativa, so that he can take this next stop. The Foundation attends to him with a lot of charisma and agility, which gave him confidence and also a sense of protection from the very useful trainings for local small businesses.

She lives with her husband and their three children in their own house, which has electricity only, and is located in the Tambogrande district, which is part of the Lambayeque department. This area is noted for its farming, livestock-raising, and handicrafts. \r\n\r\nFor several years, Gladys has sold groceries: products used daily such as milk, rice, cooking oil, sugar, toilet paper, tuna, eggs, etc. She has set up her business in the market in the area where she lives. With the earnings from the sale of her products, she tries to cover all her expenses and improve her standard of living. \r\n\r\nShe also raises and sells goats, which she sells in the local markets, once they reach their optimal growth. She has had loans financed by Kiva previously, and has shown herself to be a client who is on time with her payments. \r\n\r\nThe loans have helped her a great deal, and her store is growing little by little.

","en":"Cristina is 26 years old, has an elementary-school education and is a single mother. She has a small son, who despite her meager resources has been able to make headway and doesn't lack food, clothing or shelter, all thanks to Cristina's enterprising spirit. They live in Santo Domingo, the provincial capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, one of the provinces in Ecuador that recently has experienced high and sustained growth. The most appealing aspect of the city is its delicious fruits, and it has many tourists destinations to visit. It also relies considerably on commerce, since it has turned into an important commercial center connecting the mountain and coastal regions of the country. There are a number of tourist activities for travelers near and far alike thanks to its warm climate. Cristina owns a store where she sells casual clothes, gifts for all occasions, cosmetics and other items. She undertook this idea two years ago despite a lack of capital, and little by little she reinvested her profits into the business. She has acquired the necessary experience to be a good small-businesswoman. Now she is requesting the loan with the goal of expanding her merchandise to draw in demand from the surrounding areas. This young dreamer's goal is to give her son the education she was not able to have, and she hopes one day she will see him become a professional.

She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Pollie has been working hard to manage her boutique, which sells scarves, blouses, and baby clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Pollie has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

He intends to use this loan facility to buy more cocoa to sell as his plantation is not sufficient enough to meet the high demand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more cocoa to sell to his customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bundibugyo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":163,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-16T09:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":172836.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323216280},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-16T10:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172836.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331384684},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":172836.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339543622},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":172836.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347299386},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172836.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356512496},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166665,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":172834.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364923848}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T15:23:28Z","paid_date":"2013-05-19T08:50:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":490904,"name":"Luis Augusto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os, es soltero y pudo terminar la educaci\u00f3n secundaria.

There are businesses that generate considerable income and have made Latacunga a commercial city with various opportunities for advancement. Although there is a high level of poverty, the enterprising spirit of the inhabitants has made it stand out. In the rural and urban areas one can find families taking advantage of their talents to launch a business idea that can earn the daily bread. This is the case of Luis, who at his young age is already the owner of a small restaurant where his passion for the national cuisine is on display. The need for stable work made him pursue this venture two years ago, and he works eight hours every day at his restaurant. Now he sees the need to remodel and expand, which despite his efforts has its costs. He is sure that his customers will feel more comfortable and get better service, which is why he is requesting a loan to purchase the supplies needed to carry out this objective. He turned to Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where he found a good option to look for help, since aside from the loans, they also have training so people like Luis have the skills to better administer their businesses.

They meet once a month at one of the partners\u2019 houses in the town of Ingapirca, Cuenca. The region has a cold climate and a rugged geography, which provides for a beautiful landscape. Many of region's people work in animal husbandry and agriculture. Others leave their communities every day to go and work in the city, doing all types of jobs to help them pay the household bills and increase their household income. The region's people, just like the members of the communal bank, are friendly, kind and warm-hearted, and they still follow the culture and customs of their towns.    \r\n\r\nAna is one of the members of the communal bank, and she is 43 years old. She is separated from her husband but her marriage produced 6 children, a 22-year-old, a 20-year-old, an 18-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 12-year-old, and an 8-year-old.
