She works from 6AM TO 4PM daily and she is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nShe requests a third loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to buy more fabric, increased the food items in her restaurant and covered household expenses, and she has paid back all her loans successfully.

For the last ten years, she has been raising pigs as the family's primary source of income, and sometimes her husband works for others for a fee.\r\n\r\nSrurng has been a member of VisionFund for four loan cycles already, and she is part of a four-person loan group with other women from her village; they have been with VisionFund from one to four cycles as well. \r\n\r\nSrurng's past loans from VisionFund have helped her better support her family and allowed her to support her children's travels to work in Thailand. Now, as the group leader for this loan, she will use her portion to buy four piglets to raise. She hopes the loan's impact will increase her pig raising business so as to improve her standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1214897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy four piglets to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Srurng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bunthen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":201590.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331266109},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":403181.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355941316},{"amount":350,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1411136.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225298}],"funded_date":"2012-11-04T19:19:27Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:15:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Janicek","image":null}},{"id":485381,"name":"Jose Salvador","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Salvador de cincuenta a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus hijos en casa propia; \u00e9l se dedica a la agricultura espec\u00edficamente al cultivo de ma\u00edz y frijol, tiene varios a\u00f1os de trabajar en el rubro y se ha hecho de mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas; el terreno de cultivo esta ubicado en una zona de alta incidencia agr\u00edcola y con f\u00e1cil acceso a su vivienda, comercia en todos los alrededores de la comunidad es muy conocido y se ha hecho de mucha clientela que lo prefiere por la calidad del producto, los buenos precios pero sobre todo con un excelente servicio; Jos\u00e9 es un hombre emprendedor, dedicado a su labor, siempre esta a la expectativa de encontrar oportunidades que le ayuden a ganarse un futuro mejor, todos los d\u00edas se esfuerza al m\u00e1ximo porque sabe que as\u00ed lograr\u00e1 el \u00e9xito, en la ultima siembra tuvo perdidas y en esta temporada quiere aprovechar para recuperarse, necesita invertir por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar semilla de ma\u00edz, frijol, insecticida, herbicida, etc. Jos\u00e9 Salvador tiene buenas referencias de pago y es muy responsable, asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez conf\u00eda que le dar\u00e1 a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Jos\u00e9 Salvador, 50, lives with his life companion and their children in a house of his own.

For that loan, she was in a group of two members. With the past loan fully repaid, she can earn a decent income and uplift her lifestyle. Now, she and her co-member are seeking the same loan amount of 1,000,000 KHR each. As a group leader, her loan portion will be used to buy more grocery items for resale, including sugar, salt, canned food and instant noodles. She hopes this loan will help her to replenish her grocery items on time for customers' needs, so as she can make more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1215427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Kang cultivates her farmland by planting rice, with constant support from her spouse each season, while his primary business is to sell charcoal from his trailer. \r\n\r\nThey have aimed to increase their yields and income so that they can afford to send their children to school soon in the upcoming year. In connection with this, Kang would like to make improvements in her rice farming business to ensure a high production. Therefore, she is taking out a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 KHR for farming purposes. With the loan, she will be able to pay for labor costs, and to purchase seeds, fertilizer and pesticides for growing her rice crop. She is hoping to have a fruitful harvest and thereby make a higher income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1209633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for labor costs, and purchase seeds, fertilizer and pesticides for growing her rice crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Speu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":251988.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323019413},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":125994.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155688},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":125994.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540701},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T08:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1007954.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090854}],"funded_date":"2012-11-05T15:18:14Z","paid_date":"2013-03-21T08:41:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":486009,"name":"Nancy Viviana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

Therefore, Pov, together with her fellow group member, Chhreb, who is a first-time borrower with VisionFund, are applying for a loan with VisionFund. Pov plans to use her loan portion, which is 500,000KHR, to buy fertilizer to support her rice field and to buy pig feed in order to fatten her pigs.

He is married and has three children. He is a farmer, and he works planting basic grains such as corn and sorghum. He is also a day laborer, carrying out farm work for people who seek out his services. In addition, he also raises livestock. He currently has 8 animals (cows) that he is raising in order to sell them later. He has a ranch where he raises and feeds them; it is rented for the grazing land for the cows. He carries out this activity together with his wife. They have dedicated themselves to this work for more than 21 years. Flavio's family worked raising livestock, and he says that this activity is his family heritage. \r\n\r\nBefore he worked raising livestock, he worked in agriculture and dedicated himself to providing services as a day laborer. These activities were not very profitable, and thus he now works raising and selling livestock. He learned this profession from his parents. \r\n\r\nHe buys the livestock in the markets near his area, which are located in the city, 2 kilometers from the place where he lives. When he buys the animals at this market he transports them by herding them down the street. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in buying 3 milk cows, 300 cement tiles, 500 bricks, 12 bags of cement, 10 quintals of iron, and 1 truckload of sand, as well as paying for labor.

Nenita is married with three children. Her eldest child has settled for marriage while the other two children are still studying. \r\n\r\nNenita aims to have a stable source of income and have a better way of living someday. Her baked breads were sold out immediately so she needs additional working capital to buy more kilograms of flour, baking soda, yeast, cooking oil and sugar to improve the quality of breads she bakes. With regards to this matter, she is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP. She knows that through this loan amount, she could increase her sales and profits. In this way, she could continue to offer different kinds of RTW's and be able to finance her rice field business.

Sophat is leading a group to request a loan of 1,200,000 KHR each. For both of them, this will be their second time requesting a loan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The past loan has helped group leader Sophat to better support her family and expand her business. With her loan, Sophat will buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her cultivated land and pay the fees for plowing her rice field and transplanting rice seedlings. Her hope for the future is to be able to boost her income even more so that she can better secure her family\u2019s needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1215614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and rice seeds and pay for plowing and planting ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1400000},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1411061.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841563},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":201580.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942297},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":806320.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225311}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T21:56:43Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:16:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":483839,"name":"Sivorn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sivorn, age 49, is a villager in a rural area of Ek Phnom district, Cambodia.

To make a living, Sok works as a rice famer on two hectares of farmland and her husband complements the income by working as a Tuk-Tuk taxi driver. She has been involved in her rice farming business for 32 years, earning approximately 25,000 KHR per day. She has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles already. These loans help her to meet her family\u2019s needs. She is now leading a group of three female members to apply for a loan of 2,200,000 KHR in total.

All of his family has worked in this activity and to this day Jerem\u00edas makes silk hammocks.  Thanks to the entire family\u2019s efforts, they\u2019ve succeeded in earning economic profits.  He also works in agriculture growing corn and beans.  His parents have also taught him how to raise and fatten up pigs to butcher.\r\n\r\nHe heads to the nearest city which is a thirty-minute bus ride away every 22 days to buy the supplies needed to weave the silk hammocks and farm supplies like animal feed, among others because these types of products are not sold in his community.  He makes the hammocks with his sister because his mother takes care of the home.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy a box of thread, two pigs and feed for them.  In this way, Jerem\u00edas will have the materials on hand to continue with his hammock making business and will have pigs to fatten up and sell in five or six months.\r\n\r\nWith income obtained he wants to help his family.  His goal is to become a pig and cattle merchant; he wants to set up his own pig farm and help with his younger siblings\u2019 schooling.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1220233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy a box of thread, two pigs and feed for them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerem\u00edas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090935}],"funded_date":"2012-11-08T08:14:28Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":484907,"name":"Ammie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ammie is a loving wife whose husband is a motorcycle driver.

His name is Turgunboy, he is 41 years old, married, and has 3 children at home. The climate where he lives is conducive to animal husbandry and growing crops. For over 20 years, Turgunboy has been raising cattle and currently has 3 cows. He sells the milk to his neighbours who are very satisfied with its natural good quality. He now wants to develop his business, but he lacks the means to do so. For that reason, Turgunboy is seeking a loan of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle. He plans to use the income generated by this purchase to provide his children with a good education and the latest technology. He is waiting for your kind assistance.

Espera a futuro comprar una maquina industrial con la que brindar\u00eda mejores servicios. Con el pr\u00e9stamo Laura comprara : hilo, telas, maquina industrial etc.","en":"Laura is 34 years old and her civil status is married. She lives in northern Guayaquil, known as Orqu\u00eddeas. She is learning from her uncle who had the same profession, which she enjoys because she takes courses to widen her knowledge and improve techniques. Laura says that in all of her work what counts most is the experience one gains over time, and she has plenty of it. She works alone Monday to Sunday from seven in the morning to six in the afternoon and always finishes with the order. Her specialties are horse-riding clothes which are widely selected, as well as shirts, unisex pants, blouses, uniforms, and dresses. The workshop is located in her house where she has her machine and a table for cutting. The major problem which Laura faces is handing in the garments when they're finished, because the minibus moves and she fears thieves will steal her work. She is asking for the loan to buy another sewing machine because her current one is old and she needs a change, though she won't throw it out because she needs to find someone who it will serve. She hopes to buy an industrial machine in the future with which she would bring better service. With this loan Laura will buy thread, cloth, an industrial machine, etc."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1220860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Her name is Dilafruz. She is 32 years old, married, and has 3 children at home. The rapid pace of development of the modern world requires her to become more progressive and achieve success. For this purpose, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate.

She is motivated to provide for her family. As she wants to grow her business, she requested a loan of  10,000 PKR to buy a stock of sugar, rice and packs of biscuits from the market at lower rates.

Several years ago her parents went into debt when they purchased their home and three years ago Ninoska's mother had a stroke.   Therefore all of her father's income has been used to care for her mother, and the debt was put into Ninoska's name so she is now covering payment.\r\n\r\nHer work consists of handling legal transactions, transfer of property titles, transit and mortgage tax services and everything related to legal paperwork.  She is studying law which has given her the knowledge she needs to do her work, but says where she learns more through hands-on transactions and legal action.  Unfortunately, her mother is still ill and the doctors have recommended that she live somewhere such as Cochabamba.  She has blood pressure problems and the altitude of La Paz makes them worse.  Ninoska travels on weekends to see her mother and help out with related expenses.

She is also the mother of four children, one of whom (her daughter) is still her responsibility. Having been a teacher for 21 years, Rong earns around 22,000 KHR per day. To increase her family's income, Rong\u2019s husband works as a rice farmer on 3.5 hectares of farmland. Due to insects, the crops were of low quality. This low quality forced Rong\u2019s husband to sell the crop for lower prices than usual. As a result, the family's income declined, motivating Rong to request her first loan from VisionFund to buy pesticides for her husband\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nThe first loan has improved the quality of the crops. Now, Rong is in need of more money to buy more fertilizer to improve crop yield, which will allow her husband to sell the crops at a higher price. Therefore, she decided to request another loan after the first loan ended. Because of her good performance during the first loan cycle, Rong was appointed to be a group leader. With her group member, she is applying for a loan in the amount of 1,700,000 KHR in total. After receiving her loan portion and using it wisely, Rong hopes that her husband\u2019s rice-farming business, which forms a big part of the family\u2019s income, will provide him with better quality crop yields.

For the last 20 years, she and her husband have been growing oranges on 1.5-hectare of farmland as a primary source of family income to make a living; they supplement the income by raising pigs. The current business earns her family about 13,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day, and they can save about 3,000 KHR each day for the future needs. A lack of a water supply is the main challenge for her plantation business. \r\n\r\nSopheap is in her first loan cycle with VisionFund. She is applying for a loan of 3,500,000 KHR. With this loan, she is going to buy fertilizer and pesticides for her plantation business and will use a portion of it to spend on buying piglets for raising. She hopes to make more fruitful oranges so as to improve her standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1220598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and pesticides for her orange plantation business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Sampov Meas district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-11-02T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-02T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sopheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":584000},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":584000},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":584000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":584000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":584000},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":580000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":146,"local_amount":584000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":588669.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339641512},{"amount":146,"local_amount":584000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":588669.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046846},{"amount":583,"local_amount":2332000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2350647.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838006}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T17:02:40Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":486872,"name":"Chanry's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a wooden house with thatched walls in a rural village of the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Chanry is aged 39 years and married with no kids.

For this purpose, she purchased a buffalo five years ago and started selling the milk. She sells milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter, cheese and ghee that she makes from the milk.
