She sells for cash or on credit to a retail customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nBintou is expecting average monthly profits from this loan to reach 45,000 CFA francs.  These profits will be used in part to pay off her loan's interest.  She will reinvest the rest of the money in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1229605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various goods (pagnes, earrings and shoes).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243392},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243393},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624971},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922672},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922673},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636211},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029763},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819352},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678258},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399923989}],"funded_date":"2012-11-10T17:42:34Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":488239,"name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Los Tres \u00c1ngeles se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

Nevertheless, at 62 years old, he continues learning since this year he will cultivate watermelon along with another person who has a lot of experience.\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase his agricultural supplies, he has to travel 15 kilometers and board two buses or pay for a ride in a private vehicle, which is what Santos usually does, since his community is quite remote.  It works better for him to travel this way, to avoid arriving home very late, since the roads are in poor condition.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides and to prepare the land, since for the sowing to maintain humidity, it is necessary to till the land several times, which means he will spend more on labor.  With this investment, he will be planting 21,000 square meters of watermelon, because he will purchase all the supplies.  His dream is that his children will be experts in diverse crops so that they will be independent and better off each day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1223735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides for the preparation of the fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Efra\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970584}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T20:04:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:35:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathryn Luehm","image":830122}},{"id":487506,"name":"Samphors' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samphors is a 33-year-old father of three children, currently in the local public school.

She works at the city health center as a family doctor.  She has been a client of MDO Arvand since December 2011.  The first time she took out a loan was for her children's education.  According to Muharramjon, she is very pleased that it is possible to take out a loan to help realize one's plans.  Since she is educated and works in a professional capacity, Muharramjon has always dreamed of being able to give her children an education so they would not have difficulty with work.  She is asking for another loan to pay for her children's education.  Muharramjon is very glad that with the help of these organizations, people can achieve their goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1229137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

very good and hard-working woman.  The home in which she lives with her family is in a poor condition and urgently needs repairs.  Alfimo is 38 years old and is married with six children at home.  Her children are aged 18, 15, 13, 9, 3 and 2.  They attend school and are always asking their parents to fix their house, but the income of Alfimo and her husband does not allow for this.  She needs to replace the windows and doors, as they are not able to keep the house warm during the winters, which can get very cold in Tajikistan.  Because of the discomfort of their home, the children always have colds in the winter.  Alfimo is asking for a loan of 4,000 somoni to buy building materials and windows to repair her home.  Alfimo and her children will wait until kind creditors help them solve the problems of their home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1229530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

conditions and a small salary, but her heart is kind and her temper is good.  She is Ugulsapar from Tajikistan.  She is 37 years old and is married with four children at home.  For more than 10 years, she has been involved in raising crops like potatoes, wheat, carrots, etc.  She sells her crops in the market.  Because she has good quality produce, her goods are in high demand.  Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation and Ugulsapar takes care of the family and runs the business herself.  With the goal of providing for her family's needs, she wants to increase her business, so she will need higher crop yields.

She devotes her time carefully and works hard, as she tries to earn as much as she can since two of her children are attending school and she needs to be able to pay for her husband\u2019s medical expenses. Her husband who was a carpenter is now disabled (paralysis from hip down) and bedridden. Because of this unforeseen misfortune, she has been carrying the added responsibility both as a wife and the role of the father to meet the household requirements alone. \r\n\r\nFrom the first loan of INR 5000 from WSDS, she bought two piglets for rearing and thread for weaving. She managed to repay her loan by selling the finished traditional shawls and wrap-around skirts that she wove. She was also able to clear all her other family expenses like her children's school fees, medical expenses, etc. by selling the full grown pigs at the end of the year. \r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a KIVA loan of INR 10,000 so that she can buy two more piglets @ INR 2500 per piglet for breeding purposes, repairing and extending her pigsty, and utilise INR 2000 for purchasing thread for weaving.\r\n\r\nThe other group members have similar activities like Pi Nemneichong and among them two members have grocery shops in the village. Most of them have a ginger cum vegetable farm in the upland 'jhum' fields. They grow vegetables both for household consumption as well as for selling in the market. However, the cultivation of ginger is mainly for selling; it is harvested once a year, depending on market demand.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1221284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy two piglets for breeding, thread for weaving and to repair her pigsty.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhailam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veijahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengjaphal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinglam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neilhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimbong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rohnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-05T04:03:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":488314,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ny is 51 years old.

It pleases her to feel that she has much more to give for others and if this weren\u2019t enough she insists that dealing with people directly is what she most likes to do.

She lives in her own house that she built with much effort and dedication with help from her spouse.  She works hard every day to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nTereza\u2019s work consists primarily in manufacturing charcoal.  She\u2019s set aside space in a field in a faraway part of the city that has been ceded for this purpose and she works there every day.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for a year.  She does it in the afternoons because she works in a sawmill in the morning and that\u2019s precisely where she gets the discarded wood she needs to make the charcoal.\r\n\r\nShe started this business because she saw that the wood discarded by her sawmill was being wasted and this was how she decided to put it to use and take advantage of every last bit of wood residue.  She works with help from a day laborer and her spouse.  Occasionally she also sells fruit on the weekend or when she has free time.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she can work pressure-free and generate her own income.  It pleases her to feel that she has much more to offer workwise and if that weren\u2019t enough she insists that dealing directly with people is what she likes the most.  Fortunately, she does well because she always obtains good production which helps her increase profits.  She hopes her business will continue with the same rate of progress.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd MFP loan and she\u2019s very happy with the financial support she\u2019s getting because she\u2019ll feel more confident about making progress with her work.  On the other hand, she commits to make her installment payments punctually as scheduled.  She\u2019s very happy to be part of her communal bank because they are all very responsible and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 1000 soles to buy sawdust, sacks and other supplies she needs for her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1224824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sawdust, sacks and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tereza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":152.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":164.22},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":165.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":182.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.38,"local_amount":310.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":321.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053763},{"amount":65.69,"local_amount":164.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":169.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188695},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":170.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572607},{"amount":70.61,"local_amount":176.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":182.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122266},{"amount":73.18,"local_amount":182.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":189.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868087}],"funded_date":"2012-11-13T22:10:25Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":488554,"name":"Rozneen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Rozneen is a 36-year-old married woman.

She has completely paid back the past loans, which have helped her better support her family with enough food. Now leading her group to apply for a loan, Saly, who is the leader, will use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to buy fabrics for her tailoring business.

To support her family, Sina has a small business selling grocery items whilst her husband complements the income by working as a rice farmer on two hectares of farmland. \r\n\r\nThis hardworking woman, Sina, has been operating her business (selling grocery items) for eight years. She is a second-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The first loan that she requested has enabled her to secure the food needs for her family and, most importantly, be able to educate her beloved children by sending them to a good school.

district of Battambang province. All of his four children are dependents and still in school. He and his wife have been farming rice, and planting cabbage and cucumbers for twenty years.  They supplement their family\u2019s income through catching fish. Together they are able to earn about 50,000KHR per day to feed their family. The main challenge for his family\u2019s business is low crop yield resulting from insects.\r\n\r\nVuth has been with VisionFund for four cycles and fully paid back the past loans while the other member has been with VisionFund for three cycles.

She has 2 cows, 2 bulls, hens, and pigs, which she sells to butchers when they are mature. From this business Silvia can obtain stable earnings in a constant manner. Now she wishes to buy milk cows so that she can enter into the business of selling pure milk. A milk processing enterprise has begun buying milk from the zone's dairy farmers.\r\n\r\nThis is Silvia's 8th loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial help received during all this time. For that reason, she promises to be punctual in making her payments, plus the fact that her fellow members are responsible and supportive persons.
