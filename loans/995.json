She gets up very early every day to attend to the store that she and her parents opened when she was 12.  \"I am the only thing they have in life,\" she states.  This is why she works tirelessly to offer her family everything that it needs.  Her business is located in a central area so she has a steady income and good profits.  Through the years, she obtained customers that always buy basic goods from her.  She also sells beauty products for children, women, and men of all ages.  She also makes good profits from these sales. She now wishes to keep working very carefully and to make the most of the nearing Christmas season, during which she will make good profits.

One, a son, is dependent on her and attends school. Lim and her family live in a rural area of Dambae district, which is located in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. Lim earns a living for her family by planting cassava and rice, the business in which she has been involved for 20 years. Each day, she is able to earn approximately 14,000 KHR.  After offsetting the daily costs of living, she saves around 7,500 KHR. Lim is a second-time borrower from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). Her first loan enabled her to stabilize the finances of her family. Now Lim is in need of money to buy fertilizer and to pay labor costs.

They live in different areas of the city of Cuenca. This city has a cold climate, and since December 1999, it has been classified as part of Cultural Heritage of Mankind. The city has four rivers and great places to enjoy nature. All of the members are hard-working, some have their own businesses and others work as private employees. However, all of them have the same  goal, which is to improve the quality of life of their homes and move their families forward. They are proud to maintain the culture and traditions that their parents have instilled in them.\r\n\r\nOne of the group's members is Mar\u00eda Micaela. She has been part of the communal bank for six years and lives in the Parrish of Paccha in Cuenca. She is 42 years old, married, and has three children who are 14, 12, and 5 years old. Her first two daughters go to school and her son goes to the kindergarden  in the area. Her husband works as a private employee. The house they live in is the fruit of their marriage's work.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Micaela works in various economic activities since she is an enterprising woman. She has had a store for five months. On the weekends, she sells \"hornado\" and \"cascaritas,\" which are typical Ecuadorian dishes. At home, she also raises pigs, Guinea pigs, and chickens to sell in the community.

More than 20 years ago, Nilda saw farming as the only way to maintain her household and move forward. As always, the support of her husband has been essential. Their land is very fertile. It has produced a variety of crops, but mostly cacao, a product that has been in high demand in recent years. Sadly, their crops have been stolen on more than one occasion, by unscrupulous people who remove their plantings. Now it is cacao season, and she has to carry out needed maintenance on the crops, such as weeding, fertilizing, reenforcing the boundaries of their land to prevent strangers from entering. Her 18th loan will be for 2,000 soles. With this money, she will buy bags of organic fertilizer and hire day laborers, so that they can build a fence on their property."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1226311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer and hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-04T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-04T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":198.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":235.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":230.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":251.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":259.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":268.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":272.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":284.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":198.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":198.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053779},{"amount":91.41,"local_amount":235.91,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":236.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188711},{"amount":89.35,"local_amount":230.57,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":230.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572621},{"amount":97.36,"local_amount":251.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":251.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122282},{"amount":100.57,"local_amount":259.54,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":259.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868103},{"amount":103.88,"local_amount":268.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":268.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576934},{"amount":105.5,"local_amount":272.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":272.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529268},{"amount":110.12,"local_amount":284.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":284.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974404}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T17:40:00Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":489796,"name":"Azra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azra is a 49-year-old married woman.

Together they have five children.  Now they live in an adobe house that is their own property.  For ten years she has made a living by producing cocoa, and thanks to the type of soil her land has, which is very fertile, it has given her good production results.  She feels very pleased with her work and being able to smell the cocoa beans kept in a small store that she set up in her house, so this motivates her to keep working.  On the other hand, during the last cocoa harvesting season there was a small percentage of cocoa that she did not manage to sell because she detected a disease known as \"escoba de bruja\" (Witch's Broom, which is caused by a fungus) that ruined some plants.  Given this, she needs them to be replaced.  Therefore she has planned to plant cacao trees.  \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan and she is already very happy with this new loan opportunity because, as always, it allows her to make a good investment to the benefit of her and her family.

To generate income for the family, Kret and his wife farm rice and plant cassava, the business in which they have been involved for more than 40 years. This enables them to earn around 20,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day and save only approximately 3,000 KHR after deducting the daily cost of living. \r\n\r\nKret, a first-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a group member who also is a first-time borrower with VisionFund to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 KHR each.

She works hard to help her daughters Alexandra, 13 years old, and Daleska, 9 years old, become professionals. She explains that life taught her to be her home's only supporter, which has allowed her to reach great goals. One of these goals is to finish building her home. After getting support from MFP, the field partner, she managed to open her business dedicated to school and office supplies 3 years ago. She has complemented the sales with computer supplies and accessories due to the high demand for these.\r\nHer two young daughters are always with her and help her with minor tasks, which makes her work a source of family union. \r\nSometimes she receives orders from entities that occasionally are late with their payments, which causes her problems when balancing her accounts.

Sichan has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for four loan cycles already, with which she succeeded in improving her day-to-day livelihood.

Additionally, she sells various spare parts and accessories. She is also installing a car wash, which she knows will complement her business because her goal is to offer a complete, high quality service. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her job is the profits which the work generates, due to the continued demand in the market.

He is married and lives with his wife and their 3 children, ages 20, 13, and 9, in a church where he is pastor. Juan and his wife wish to provide the children with a good education and a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nJuan works as an electrician. When a neighbor, acquaintance, or new customer wants to install new wiring in a house, or make an electrical installation, they don't hesitate to call Juan immediately. His work is principally based on the electrification of homes, with all the security norms. He has been doing this work independently for 8 years, after initially working for privately-owned shops. That's how he learned the skill and gained lots of experience, enabling him to work now with much expertise and responsibility. On occasions, he also works as a 'mototaxi' operator.\r\n\r\nThings are going well for Juan. He frequently receives work contracts and always performs a job with optimal results and great care, since he doesn't want to suffer or cause lamentable accidents. Juan dedicates his remaining disposable time to offering spiritual guidance in his evangelical temple. His income depends on the work he has. He desires to continue working and expanding his work equipment with the tools and accessories that permit him to do his work much faster.\r\n\r\nThis is his 4th loan through MFP.

The rich, traditional culinary dishes found in the area also add to the appeal of San Clemente and Portoviejo.\r\n\r\nAna is 53 years old, and lives in Portoviejo. She is a single mother, and her 21-year-old son lives with her. Ana has been an active member of the Community Bank since it's creation, and is very grateful for the community focus and the support she has received there.\r\n\r\nAna makes a living operating a clothing sales business where she travels door to door, three days a week selling various styles of clothes. When she is not traveling, she also sells clothing from her home to her regular customers, and offers payment plans on credit for the benefit of her clients.

For the past 8 years, Jane has been working hard to manage her plastic warehouse, which sells plastic cups, plates, and other plastic items. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more plastic items to sell, and will help Jane to generate greater profits and diversify income to start poultry farming. Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to construct a commercial building. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

With these items in bulk, she can now produce a larger quantity of rice and sauce for sale. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1228033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy cooking ingredients like rice, palm oil, tomatoes, onions, pepper, etc., in bulk in order to stop buying retail.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T03:00:09Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":480000},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":480000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":489325.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323744742},{"amount":225,"local_amount":960000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":978651.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331236852},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":489325.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340104574},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":489325.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347350124},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-21T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":489325.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357089653},{"amount":89.06,"local_amount":380000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":387382.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364821365},{"amount":23.44,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":101942.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373022522},{"amount":225,"local_amount":960000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":978651.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381810426},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":489325.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390670544}],"funded_date":"2012-11-13T15:18:00Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:22:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":491162,"name":"Nikesi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nikesi is widowed and has one grown up child.

It offers a diversity of beautiful places and a rich variety of traditional dishes from the region.\r\n\r\nMartha lives in this place.  She is 32 years old and lives in a common-law marriage from which she has two children, ages 11 and 8, who attend school.  Her husband makes a living fishing.\r\n\r\nWith the intention of earning something on her own and with this being able to help her husband with the household expenses, she dedicates herself to business selling all kinds of clothing.  Her method of sales is door-to-door and she also sells in her house where her most well-known clients come.  She also works from a base of orders that her customers make in advance.  She gives them easy payment plans as she puts her customers on credit and collects every fifteen days.  She goes to buy her merchandise in Guayaquil each time she needs it.  She has dedicated more than a year to this activity and it is going very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy more merchandise such as pants, blouses, t-shirts and children\u2019s clothing.  She has been in the communal bank for two loan cycles and she likes the help that the loans represent for her business. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to give her children the very best. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1226391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts and children\u2019s clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":663.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":241.06,"local_amount":236.85,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":241.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127319},{"amount":144.64,"local_amount":142.11,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":144.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517783},{"amount":96.43,"local_amount":94.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069595},{"amount":96.42,"local_amount":94.74,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815679},{"amount":48.22,"local_amount":47.37,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":48.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525828},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":47.39,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":48.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926700}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T03:51:30Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:21:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":491124,"name":"Shem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shem is a 59-year-old married man with eight children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

He also believes he will have bought another quality dairy cow that produces high quality milk in the next five years, hence more income that will help him improve on his standard of living and be

This area is known for their large avocado plantations, as well as their colorful dress. Many women weave red, yellow, and purple huipiles. Las Manzanas, is a group filled with energetic women, ready to take on the challenges of the business world. When asked if they liked being a member of the group, with all smiles, the answer was a unanimous \u201cYes\".\r\n\r\nSilvia, though shy at first, actively engaged in trying to solve her personal and business problems with the support of her group. Recently widowed and having her only son live an hour away, Silvia found herself at an impasse. She had been a housewife all her life. Occasionally, she had some chickens that she sold in a nearby market, but she never thought she would one day be without her husband. Though she says that at first she struggled, she got up and decided to start, not one business, but two. Barely six months after losing her husband, Silvia has a small animal husbandry business, as well as a tortilla bakery. She currently runs them both from her home but says she hopes to one day find small shop where she can sell her tortillas.

Joice is 21 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children with 1 of them currently in school. For the past 3 years, Joice has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joice has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh food like matooke, cassava and sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Joice to generate greater profits. She will manage to pay some of her child's school fees and buy new clothes for herself and the child. Joice hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nJoice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past , Shadia has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Shadia has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Shadia to generate greater profits and save her money for future use. Shadia hopes that in the future she will be able to move out of her parents house and start renting her own. \n\nShadia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1225272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

neighbourhood. The lady wearing  a light blue  saree standing in left side of photograph is Mata who is the leader of the group. Mata is a 38-year-old woman married to a fisherman of Balugaon village in Odisha, India. The couple has a son who is in school. Mata lives with her son and together with her husband takes care of all the household expenses. She helps her husband in selling the fish. Her husband goes to the lake every morning for fishing and she sells those fish in the market as fresh fish and keeps some of them for drying. (Drying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use.  It is done by drying them in the sun until water is completely evaporated.)

He works from 5am to 1pm and afterwards goes home, where his family is waiting for him to eat lunch together. Then at 4pm, he goes out again to continue working as a taxi driver until 8pm. In August this year, he was in an accident, which left his vehicle in bad condition and the person that hit him ran away.

Since he was a small child, he has worked in agriculture with his father. Around 15 years ago, they decided to focus on banana production. With a lot of effort from the whole family, they managed to cultivate around 15 hectares of banana, together with his siblings and parents. With the passage of time, his father decided to hand over, through purchase and sales, 5 hectares of bananas to each of his children. With this income, Edil decided to overcome a little more; he entered the Indigenous University that provided him with a lot of benefits for starting a career in aquaculture or fish farming. He has been studying for two years and is in the seventh semester of the degree. In order to be able to continue with the agricultural work, he undertakes these activities in his free days, working on the land. In these last years, these activities have led him to require newer transport to be able to get around more easily between his agricultural activities and university studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1226603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorcycle to commute to his agricultural plot.
