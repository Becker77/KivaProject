She has four children ranging in age from 14 years to 28 years. Chirindo describes herself as a social woman. She operates a food stall where she sells ground nuts. She has been involved in this business for eight years. Her business is located in a viable business area, and her primary customers are mostly women and also local residents.

They built their house themselves.  Since 2007, Erdenetsogt has been working as a driver in a mining company that is undertaking exploration work in another province of Mongolia. His wife has worked as a steel frame worker in a building company for seven years. In winter, when his company stops working due to the frozen ground, Erdenetsogt runs a taxi business and his wife works as a plasterer in her company. His two children attend a secondary school near their home. \r\n\r\nLast spring, Erdenetsogt's coal burning furnace was ruined. So, before the winter, Erdenetsogt is preparing his home and planning to install a low-pressure furnace and build a block fence around his home. For this reason, Erdenetsogt is asking for a 3,000,000 MNT loan. By doing this, his family will be provided with comfortable living conditions. And, most importantly, he can cut their usage of coal by using a low-pressure furnace and save his land from the stiff winds that usually occur in spring.

For the past five years, Tamer has had a store for designing and implementing wedding cards, seals, and shields upon customers' request. This store has been a profitable and the only source of income for him, but also it needs more improvements and support to cover the cost.\n\nTamer is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the cost of purchasing new printer machine. Taking this loan will help Tamer to meet the increasing demand from customers by doing his work in high quality and less time. This will increase sales and improve Tamer's income positively.\n\nTamer is photographed inside his store.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He lives with his mother in his mother\u2019s old wooden house in the ger district, the area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity, in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe has been running a taxi business since 2008. His mother is a pensioner. \r\n\r\nIn July of 2012, he sold his old car and bought a new second-hand one that runs on gas. He loves the car.

In addition, he runs a small-scale agricultural business and has a plot of land and a vineyard. Mikheil grows nuts and picks grapes in the late summer to produce wine. The harvested nuts and wine are sold at the local open market. It makes totally 200 Laris per month, which is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. According to Credo estimations, Mikheil belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMikheil requested a loan from Credo to start-up a dairy business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Mikheil will purchase a milk cow. After the milk cow is purchased, he will be able to receive milk and produce dairy products, which will be sold at the local open market.

Stellah  will use the loan of 41,600 KES requested from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding of dairy cows!' Her biggest challenge is 'Diseases.' One animal in the farm is named 'Matunda.'\r\n\r\nStellah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because Juhudi Kilimo offers loans to farmers for a period that is good for a farmer to be able to repay comfortably.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'I learnt that microfinance are short-term loans given to small-scale farmers and also small-scale enterprises.'\r\n\r\nStellah's highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Stellah replied, 'It will benefit from the sale of milk because they will get basic household needs and education for our children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Stellah owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle, motorcycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, DVD' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1228457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

is a 36-year-old married woman. She has two children, 6 and 10 years old. She describes herself to be a hardworking woman. She operates a retail store where she sells cereals such as maize, beans, etc. She has been involved in this business for six years. Her business is located at a viable business area, and her primary customers are local residents. She describes her biggest business challenge to be high transportation costs.

For the past 2 years, Regina has been working hard to manage her fish vending business, which sells fish and matooke. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Regina has requested a loan of 400000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. Regina will use this loan to get more food and fish to sell, allowing her to generate greater profits and helping her supply her basic needs from those profits. Regina hopes that in the future she will be able to increase her business. \r\n\r\nRegina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past two years, Mariam has been working hard to manage her clothes store, where she sells ladies' clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan in the amount of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan proceeds will be used to purchase more clothes, which she expects will help her generate more profits. In the future, Mariam hopes that saving such profits will enable her to build a home for her family. <p> \r\n\r\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Deysi is 36 years old and lives in the District of Maica Central Parada #3, an area known for its intensive level of dairy farming.  She is married to Dorio and they have two school-age children.  They have managed their family business, a dairy farm, very well.  Everything they produce is delivered to \u201cPlanta Industrialadora de Leche\u201d (a South American dairy processing company).  Their dairy cows are pure-bred.  \r\n<p>\r\nDeysi and her husband work on the land that she inherited from her mother.  The prices of supplies for her dairy are very expensive and she needs operating capital to buy soybean husks since this component makes up part of the diet for her cows.  Grasses are scarce during the winter season, so her cows consume mostly soybean husks.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to working at the dairy, her husband performs auto body repairs in this same area and has a small repair shop at home.  Everything that Deysi and her husband do is geared toward improving the living conditions for themselves and their children.

She is the mother of five children, four of whom still live with her.  None of her children attends school because all of them work selling snowcones (shaved ice) with their father while Martha works selling corn tortillas.  She learned this trade from her mother, who taught her to make tortillas.  She was the only one who learned how to.  Martha only completed school through the primary level because her family did not have the financial resources to send Martha to school for longer.  \r\n\r\nMartha's home is very simple but her family is very hardworking.  She longs to improve her family's standard of living and to enroll all of her children in school so that they can have the education she was not able to have.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy corn, lime and firewood to make tortillas.

She has three children but only lives with one, Lisbeth. She lives in hre own house located in Paccha. She mainly grows potatoes and corn, as well as alfalfa to feed her animals. She has cows and sheep that she brings to pasture in the countryside with her daughter when the alfalfa production is scarce. Alfalfa production is generally not enough during the summer time and what she is able to harvest she sells in the main market of her town. She also sells her animals, including sheep, cows and bulls, when the opportunity presents itself. Her animals typically are kept near her home. \r\n\r\nShe considers it good to have two types of activities running parallel to maintain income stability and progressively grow. Since she is such a hard worker, she also works packaging chicken for a company, doing so two to three times a week, as she also has to care for her animals and harvest. She has now traced concrete goals to continue growing and is certain she will achieve them. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the solidarity group \"Productoras Agr\u00edcolas Las Emprendedoras\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She is thankful for the financial support that has been brought to her in a constant manner. She now has the means to improve her business.

She lives with William, her husband of 10 years.  They have three children, Estefan\u00eda, Josu\u00e9 and Jean Carlos, who she cares for in her own house located in Usibamba.  Her motto is constant work.  She prepares the food she\u2019ll sell at her local school very early in the morning.  She opened a small business there two years ago selling snacks, soft-drinks and home-made food to students and teachers who visit Yanet during recess.  She says that it was difficult for her to get permission to sell inside the school but \u201cnothing\u2019s difficult is you stick with it,\u201d she affirms.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, being a woman from the countryside, she also grows oats and raises cows.  She plants on communal land every weekend and makes yoghurt and cheese with milk from her cows.  But the activity that is most profitable is selling ice-cream and frozen pops during her local market days; she earns good profits then.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to work with more dedication in all of her activities because that\u2019s how she feels fulfilled.  She belongs to the \u201cUsibamba\u201d communal bank and this is her 6th MFP loan.  She is grateful for the financial support she\u2019s constantly being granted because now she has the means to improve her business.  She promises to be punctual with her payments since she\u2019s been taught to be responsible.  Yanet will use the requested money to buy more frozen treats to sell during market day and if the money goes far enough she will also buy snacks for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1227532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

However, these days she is facing problems in completing orders on time due to a shortage of raw material.

Among these are: selling shoes, CDs, fish, and cell phones; making traditional skirts, and buying fish nets.\r\n\r\nThe loan they are requesting will benefit micro-enterprises, including the business of member Mrs. Carmen Rosa. She says this is the 1st time she has worked through Pro Mujer, having joined at the invitation of a promoter from that institution. Currently, Carmen's business makes traditional skirts to measure. She says she learned the business while working in a seamstress shop; then she decided to start her own shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is soliciting will increase her capital for purchasing cloth from wholesalers. After making the skirts, Carmen will distribute them to stores on request. This type of work allows her to generate resources to help, as much as possible, with household expenses, since she lives in a common law marriage and has a son.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Carmen Rosa responded that she especially likes the health program.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1227534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cloth for making traditional skirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":2950,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Limbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Mar\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia Maribel\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20304.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3263.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3408.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3408.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3408.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3408.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3408.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":474.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":474.1,"local_amount":3263.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3275.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095535},{"amount":495.17,"local_amount":3408.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235611},{"amount":495.17,"local_amount":3408.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617444},{"amount":495.17,"local_amount":3408.2,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172038},{"amount":495.16,"local_amount":3408.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914256},{"amount":495.23,"local_amount":3408.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625248}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T02:02:10Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:20:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":491749,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther has been selling a variety of used clothes in Olkalou Town for the last three years.

has raised two children. Her daughter is married and her son is studying. \r\n\r\nIn the search of a source of income for the family, Tamara started working with livestock breeding in 1976. After having started with 5,000 som (KGS), the farm today brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and from re-selling of livestock. Thanks to Tamara's hard work, the number of livestock today counts 3 dairy cows, 18 sheep and 1 horse. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Tamara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 55,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of livestock. The purpose of the loan is to purchase two bulls. Tamara plans to invest the income in further increasing the number of livestock. In the future, according to the plans that Tamara shared with us, she dreams of purchasing an apartment in the city of Karakol."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1230551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 2 bulls for fattening and reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sary-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T23:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T23:20:08Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459700},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458833},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495382},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6928.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776903},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":27712.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552806}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T02:51:19Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":492495,"name":"Ararati Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Masika est membre du groupement d\u2019affaire Ararati, elle est mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e d\u2019environ 46 ans et m\u00e8re de 7 enfants.

It meets every fifteen days in Montecristi known for its rich pre-colonial culture and for its crafts that are renown both nationally and internationally; it\u2019s where the famous straw hats are from.\r\n\r\nThis is a group of very humble, hardworking people who when they learned about the benefits available from the institution decided to join together and form this group to improve the businesses they have.  They carry out a variety of activities like crafts and general commerce, among others.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Ruth, 51.  She\u2019s separated and has four children, three who are already adults and a 17-year-old who is attending university.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a great mother, in order to get ahead she sells Yanbal products (beauty products and perfumery) and all types of clothes.  She sells door to door and works every afternoon.  She sells most of her products based on prior customer orders.  What she sells most is perfume and women\u2019s clothes.  She buys the clothes every two weeks in Guayaquil and in Quito as needed.  She\u2019s been in business three years and is able to support her family with profits earned.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy clothes and Yanbal brand cosmetics because she has several pending orders.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for two cycles and likes it because the loans help her in her business very much.  Her dream is that her son becomes a professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1227571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes and Yanbal brand cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-11-05T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-05T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prissila Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merida Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Washington Isidro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer Gissela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johanna Lissette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabian Ignacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Silvana Mariuxi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cliofe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5354.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":669.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":669.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":671.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1343.76,"local_amount":1338.52,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990953},{"amount":1343.76,"local_amount":1338.52,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127329},{"amount":1343.75,"local_amount":1338.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517793},{"amount":1343.73,"local_amount":1338.49,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069605}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T08:58:31Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:00:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":492511,"name":"Solidarite Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Lenge est pr\u00e9sidente du collectif d\u2019affaire \"Solidarit\u00e9\", elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 jeunes enfants.

Fortunately, based on effort and extra work hours they met all their obligations and this motivated them to continue with still more dedication.  One of the objectives they have in mind is to acquire a second vehicle and do longer routes because demand for transportation by local residents is increasing and this could lead to her reaching her future dream of owning a grocery store.\r\n\r\nLike all vehicles it sometimes has breakdowns which are why she wants to have additional money to counteract the inconveniences caused by them.

Like every independent mother, she has the desire to see her children complete a higher education and that would make her feel very proud. \r\n\r\nThey live together in a house of good material that she was able to build alone with effort and dedication.\r\n\r\nPreviously, she made a living doing agricultural activities, but she was presented with an opportunity in the commercial area which was the buying and selling of wood blocks extracted from forests which are constantly reforested. \r\n\r\nShe has performed this work for 10 years, and throughout this time she has been generating good earnings which have also allowed her to travel to different places in the country to personally deliver her merchandise.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the things that has made her normal business performance difficult was providing goods to local municipalities who had serious delays in their payments and caused her serious inconveniences.\r\n\r\nShe plans to continue doing this work, which is how she will acquire a truck for transport, since she currently hires private transporters, and as she says, the payment for freight is expensive.\r\n\r\nWhen the extraction season begins, she must target those areas where she can make the bulk purchase of the wood blocks and make payment in full before other vendors get to them ahead of her.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan, and she states that these loans have always been a great help and in response to receiving them she made her payments in a punctual manner. The 2,000 nuevos soles she requested will supplement her working capital which serves for the purchase of blocks of wood that will later be marketed across the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1228162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood blocks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T01:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T01:30:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macedonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":217.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":219.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":241.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":249.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":257.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":259.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":274.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":280.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.29,"local_amount":217.52,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":219.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053803},{"amount":84.97,"local_amount":219.29,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":221.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188735},{"amount":93.57,"local_amount":241.47,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":243.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572637},{"amount":96.65,"local_amount":249.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":251.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122303},{"amount":99.83,"local_amount":257.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868121},{"amount":100.46,"local_amount":259.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":261.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576946},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":274.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":276.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529280},{"amount":108.81,"local_amount":280.8,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":283.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974414}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T13:53:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":491825,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a Lebanese married man.

In order to improve their finances, she decided, with Juan, who until that time had been working as in an employee in an auto repair shop, to have their own business in order to ensure their family's livelihood. \r\n\r\nThis is how they have had a repair shop for various vehicles for three years, and alongside that, a well-stocked spare parts store that she runs. Forming a two-person team, they work with the aim of making the business grow in the future. She also says that working together with Juan to get ahead in life, makes their marital happiness grow. This makes her job one the best she has had. \r\n\r\nNoting the increased number of vehicles in her area, she needs to have a wide range of parts, as well as commercial lubricants. This is why she must have enough working capital available to allow her to place an order a week in advance.  \r\n\r\nOne of her shorter-term objectives is to open a branch in another nearby town, and this way expand as a small business owner. She also wants to raise enough money to make the dream of having her own house a reality.\r\n\r\nShe has the pleasant opportunity of belonging to MFP for the first time, so she feels very happy, and at the same time committed to making her installment payments. \r\n\r\nThe 500 soles will be used to complement her working capital, which is earmarked for the purchase of merchandise for her business, such as small spare parts, lubricants, and other items.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1228167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy spare parts and lubricants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T02:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.75,"local_amount":54.37,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":56.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053804},{"amount":21.92,"local_amount":54.81,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":57.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188736},{"amount":24.15,"local_amount":60.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":62.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572638},{"amount":24.94,"local_amount":62.35,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":64.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122304},{"amount":25.76,"local_amount":64.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868122},{"amount":25.92,"local_amount":64.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":67.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576947},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":68.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529281},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":70.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974415}],"funded_date":"2012-11-08T16:14:52Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":491251,"name":"Guillermo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Guillermo y su esposa tiene una hija que estudiando la secundaria, ellos son originario de la ciudad de Nuevo Laredo, tiene ya mas de 12  a\u00f1os que adquirieron su vivienda y a la cual poco a poco le ha realizado mejorar.

When he first started, business was good as there was not much competition, but with the arrival of bigger eating places, his business became slow. It is for this reason that, in 2009, he signed up to become a mobile money transfer agent. Offering the service of sending and receiving money in his restaurant gave him the foot traffic that he needed to keep his shop open.  \r\n\r\nHe says his major challenge is low working capital. He constantly has to go to the bank so that he can satisfy his customers. Furthermore, his restaurant has no electricity. This, he says, is a major disadvantage for him because he cannot serve his customers cold drinks.\r\n\r\nSausten needs the Kiva loan so that he can increase his working capital.

He lives in the company of his wife, with whom he has four children they care for in the house they acquired in their community 24 years ago.  Since he was very young he has made a living in agriculture; his family have been peasants for many generations.  He has farming land in Chuqui and Matar\u00e1, where he was born.  There he plants corn, beans, and potatoes of every variety.  When the planting season begins he spends the day immersed in the field and nature, preparing the earth for the seed, caring for the growth of the food, and providing a lot of love.\r\n\r\nHe has more than 20 years of experience in the food business.  Thanks to this he has a little house with his wife 25 minutes from the nearby city where he sells and makes his earnings, although he says that during times of plenty he sells his harvest in the city of Huancayo where he gets more profit.
