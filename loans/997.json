She states that she\u2019s very grateful for the financial support provided because she\u2019ll be able to improve her income this way that will make it possible for her business to grow and for her to continue supporting her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1229243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables and legumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Calpules, Cortes","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Waldina Beatris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1183.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1411.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1460.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1511.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1564.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1619.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1675.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1734.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1795.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1858.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1923.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2263}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":1183.01,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332035254},{"amount":72.32,"local_amount":1411.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339605921},{"amount":74.85,"local_amount":1460.47,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1474.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154887},{"amount":77.47,"local_amount":1511.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1526.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356559514},{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":1564.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364614323},{"amount":82.98,"local_amount":1619.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373194758},{"amount":576.57,"local_amount":11250.09,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11358.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382006771}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T15:34:20Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T09:05:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":492067,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia  lives together with the husband, who is a farmer, and 4 children at AdumBandu, near Takoradi.

is a 55-year-old, married woman. She and her husband have five children between the ages of 15 and 33 years.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, she sells food and fried fish, which is her specialty. She has already been working in this line of business for a number of years. She operates her business out of her home. Despite her advanced age, Mwanakombo explains that she is very responsible.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan from this institution. She would like to use the loan proceeds to buy a freezer.

They live in their own house, which he built himself in an agricultural district. Mateo is a man with perseverance. He has worked in agriculture for more than 20 years. Each season he leases land for his crops, but a year ago he acquired a plot of land of his own (one of his achievements and for which he feels pleased). There he also grows vegetables. One of the problems that he has always faced is the climatic change in the area, because of the intense cold and the rains. \"In spite of the cold, the rains are beneficial. In these months the big plantings begin, thanks to the rains,\" he mentions optimistically. With the help of his wife and two of their older children, he grows his products with happiness, because he likes his work. The satisfaction comes when he receives the money produced by his sales in the wholesale market of Tarma. His next goals are to finish this October and November planting season; for that he needs your support to acquire organic fertilizers and seeds. With this loan, it will be the ninth time that Mateo has worked with MFP. His communal bank is called \"Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n\" (New Jerusalem), and he feels at ease with his fellow bank members because he is punctual in his payments and savings. Mateo will invest the money in the purchase of organic fertilizer for his crops of potatoes, and he will also buy a bag of seeds for peas.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1228879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer and seeds for peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":272.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":288.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":281.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":310.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":321.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":324.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":345.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.1,"local_amount":272.06,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053809},{"amount":112.71,"local_amount":288.99,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":293.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188743},{"amount":108.83,"local_amount":279.04,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572645},{"amount":121.89,"local_amount":312.55,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":316.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122311},{"amount":125.51,"local_amount":321.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":326.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868129},{"amount":126.39,"local_amount":324.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":328.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576954},{"amount":273.57,"local_amount":701.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":711.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529287}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T23:38:10Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":492118,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 30-year-old Mariama from Torkpoi town, Bo Southern area, in Sierra Leone.

from Sierra Leone! This is 26-year-old Joyce, from Torkpoi town, Bo Southern area. She is married and has no child, for now.  She has two relatives that she takes care of at home. \r\n\r\nJoyce runs a clothing business within her environment. She sells traditional pattern and design cloth. She has been running this business for 7 years. She works at the business every day, 6 days per week. Her business is the only source of income she has. Joyce says that the main challenge to her business is that sometimes customers refuses to pay her, after she provides goods on credit. \r\n\r\nJoyce has requested a loan in order to prepare more tie dye fabric for her to sell. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and start a savings account. In the future, she plans to open a clothing store. She thanks you for your

Her new business is giving Lorena the opportunity she needs to better provide for her kids and create a better future for them.  \r\n\r\nThough Lorena\u2019s business is growing, she lacks the capital to purchase more quality inventory.  Lorena will use her $3,200 Kiva loan to purchase much needed inventory in time for the holiday season.  She dreams of someday growing her business to the point where she can move into a storefront boutique.

F\u00e9lix is a hard worker and a responsible man. Ever since he got married he has worked with dedication as a farmer. He has the farmland his community gave him and on that land he grows several varieties of potatoes, peas, fava beans, and vegetables like carrots, lettuce, cabbage, and others. However, he considers it more profitable to grow peas and potatoes because of the high demand there is for these products and the profit he obtains by selling them. \r\n\r\n\"I started out farming two plots of land, and now my production has increased to five,\" he says proudly. His older children are now independent, so he hires workers to harvest and farm the land. Now he wants to purchase bags of organic fertilizer to start planting potatoes, which is why he is requesting help. This will be his 10th loan with MFP. He says he will pay his monthly installments on time. He belongs to the communal bank Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n and feels comfortable working as a team. He will invest the requested 2,500 soles in the purchase of twenty bags of organic fertilizer for his future potato crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1228885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase twenty bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-06T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-06T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":272.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":288.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":281.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":310.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":321.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":324.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":345.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":355.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.1,"local_amount":272.06,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053810},{"amount":112.71,"local_amount":288.99,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":293.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188744},{"amount":108.83,"local_amount":279.04,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572646},{"amount":120.94,"local_amount":310.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":314.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122312},{"amount":126.46,"local_amount":324.29,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":328.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868130},{"amount":126.39,"local_amount":324.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":328.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576955},{"amount":273.57,"local_amount":701.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":711.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529288}],"funded_date":"2012-11-22T10:10:42Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":492126,"name":"Gregory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gregory is an established author of the acclaimed book, \u201cHelp!!!

They chose their name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they live and hold their meetings. The group is located in the village of Vicente, where the Las Margaritas sugar refinery provides employment to the inhabitants of Vicente and nearby communities.\r\nEduardo is one of the members of the group. He is 42 years old and married, and he only completed high school. He tells us that he's worked at the sugar refinery since he was young, but a little over a year ago he decided to open his own business selling groceries in his house to earn a little more money and be able to give his family a higher quality of life. His wife tends the shop, and he tells us it's quite successful because the neighborhood is a new one and only has two stores. He keeps his store well stocked with a variety of products so his customers will always find what they're looking for and become loyal to his store. He will use this loan to buy beans, rice, tuna, soup, oil, cookies and crackers, soap, bleach, soft drinks, canned goods, toilet paper, toothpaste, and sweets to restock his business. In the future he would like to be able to build a separate building for his shop.\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nTrinidad - clothing sales\r\nNorma - perfume sales\r\nMartha - clothing sales\r\nYanet - lingerie sales\r\nNancy - shoe sales"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1229015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beans, rice, tuna, soup, oil, cookies and crackers, soap, bleach, soft drinks, canned goods, toilet paper, toothpaste, and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Vicente, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet Monserrat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":891.67,"local_amount":11666.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11672.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068140},{"amount":445.83,"local_amount":5833.34,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5836.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284878},{"amount":222.92,"local_amount":2916.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2918.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199169},{"amount":668.75,"local_amount":8750.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8754.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595977},{"amount":445.83,"local_amount":5833.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5836.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663422}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T03:25:01Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:50:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":492253,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia works hard to support her family.

He lives in Khoni District with his 68-year-old mother (pensioner) and 29-year-old son. His son has chronic health problems and receives a pension from the local government. Koba requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but met no success. His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and poor family living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only current source of income for the family is from agricultural business. In particular, they have vineyard of 200 vine trees and produce vines to sell locally at good prices. Koba has 0.5 hectares of land where he sows different kinds of vegetables. In addition, the family has a calf. This is hardly enough food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKoba requested a loan from Credo to start-up another family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase a cow. After purchasing the cow, he will be able to produce dairy and milk products. This will significantly increase the family income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Davron is a young man with a kind character. He is married and has one child. He is a carpenter, and has been working in this field for more than 10 years. He makes various kinds of windows, doors, and floors. His wife is a homemaker.

Dentro del grupo participa Jessica quien tiene una tienda es hermana de Don Jes\u00fas. ","en":"The \"Accesorios Clemente\" [\"Clemente Accessories\"] group has been through three loan cycles with the institution, and they comment that they are very happy and grateful, since thanks to the loans they have grown a lot. Jes\u00fas is the group's representative. He is 28 years old and has lived in a common-law marriage with Josefina for 10 years. Together they have formed a family with three children, two of whom go to school. Jes\u00fas and Josefina have a family business selling auto accessories. They sell colored bulbs, decals, car deodorizers, steering wheels, floor mats, etc. This time they are requesting the loan to buy more products that they need, such as cables for the installation of their alarms. Jes\u00fas comments: \u201cPreviously I didn't know how to carry out the installation of the alarms, but I am taking classes to learn and to make progress with my business, since the difficulty that arose is not knowing how to manage my business, because I only started it recently, and I started it because my papa worked in this field.\" Jes\u00fas only has three years of experience with his business. Jes\u00fas' goal is to make his business grow, but he would also like it if in the future he could set up a new business near his home, because the space where he currently has his accessories business is only lent to him, and he has to pay the rent monthly, which is an expense for his family that he is obligated to pay. Within the group, Jessica also participates; she is Jes\u00fas' sister and operates a store.

Mezam division North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life -- including sickness of family members, and the deaths of her mother and her father, who were so supportive of her -- that she became frustrated with the ways of life. \r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 2010, and has successfully managed and repaid GHAPE loans twice before. Given a new loan, she will expand her pig farm by buying more piglets and pig feed, and also she will expand her restaurant business by buying cooking ingredients, like rice, oil, beans and maize, which will facilitate the proper functioning of her restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe believes that her businesses will succeed, because she has regular customers who frequently buy from her. She has a good business site for the restaurant, which together with the quality food she serves, attracts more customers. From this activity the community will benefit, having a regular food supply at moderate prices. The pig droppings will serve as fertilizer for the community's crop land, for which there is high demand, and it will greatly increase farm productivity.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will educate her children and provide basic necessities. She will also plough back profit into the businesses. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of low interest rates, the management and marketing techniques thought by GHAPE staff."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1230595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded

is married and the father of seven children who live in a three-bedroom house in the Mankon Bamenda in the North West Region of Cameroon. He has faced many challenges, including securing inadequate funds to educate his children, and many tragedies, including family disputes, a fire, armed robbery, the death of family members, and fighting to get his family property. He joined GHAPE in 2010 and has taken and repaid one loan. \r\n\r\nHe promises that if gets the new loan he is applying for, he will open a poultry farm after using the money to buy chicks and the supplies he needs to care for them. He says that his business will succeed because he lives in a community that is suffering from inadequate poultry farms and because he has a good business site. He also says that the community will benefit from having access to poultry at moderate prices, including for use in ceremonies. He will use the additional income he earns to provide his family with a better diet and adequate medications, as well as save money to invest in his future.

Since 2002, he has worked as an operator in a construction company. Since 1984 his wife has worked as a technologist in a bread and candy factory. Now, due its old age, his house is in incredibly poor condition. During the last year, he burned a large amount of coal to warm the house to overcome the winter cold. So, before the winter, he has planned to repair the roof, to change doors and windows and fix the outside of house by using energy-saving materials like foam, glass-wool, double-glazed windows and bricks. Tsogtsaikhan is requesting 5,000,000 MNT loan to buy energy-saving materials for his house in order to cut the usage of coal and contribute to efforts to save the

With that credit, she obtained better liquidity and increased her working capital as well as her sales and earnings. Now, Aura Sofia wants a new Kiva loan, her fourth, to purchase clothing, accessories and shoes wholesale. Taking advantage of the high sales holiday season of the end of the year, she is sure she will be successful with such an investment.

She believes strongly that her business will succeed because she has longevity in the business, she has a good business site and she has regular customers who buy from her shop. She says with this boost in business activity, the community will have a supply of good quality dresses, shoes and handbags and also benefit from moderate prices.\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will expand the business, educate her children, add to her savings in GHAPE and increase the standard of living in her house.

Her lack of inadequate funds to finance an education for her children and provide them with some basic necessities is a major challenge in her life. \r\n\r\nShe has invested and successfully repaid her loans eight times. She says that this new loan will help her engage in intensive agriculture by buying  farmland, improved farm seedlings like maize, beans, and yams, and fertilizer to enrich the soil. She is very positive that her business will succeed because she has a good knowledge of agriculture. She looks forward to planting improved seedlings and applying fertilizer to the farm to increase and improve yield. Through her agriculture, the community will consume good food at moderate prices, the products will be available at all times, and some of the yields will be sold to other farms so that they can cultivate, too.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she intends to educate her children in school, pay the necessary bills, provide three square meals to her family and invest in her business. GHAPE loans remain the most preferable to her because of the low interest rate, convenient repayment intervals, and education to the members on loan management before the loans are disbursed.

Forty years ago, he decided to venture into commercial farming.

The group members are Dona Adelina, Juana, Juliana, Benita and No\u00e9; all of the members are applying for this loan to invest it in buying lambs. The group name was chosen by Lety, who is also part of the group. She says that they decided to use this name because the day that the institution called at the house to invite them to apply for their loan, she was very surprised by it and she thought that this was a good choice for a name. Dona Lety says that she is 38 years old and she has been married to Jose for 19 years. In the family that they have created together they have 4 children who are all currently studying. Lety says that she raises lambs to sell: she buys them when they are young and raises them until they are large, strong and fattened, then she sells them on to people who grill them to sell. Dona Lety says, 'The bigger my lambs get, the more money I will earn although often my greatest difficulties come when the animals get sick and lose a lot of weight, or even when they die and that means I lose my whole investment and earnings. However, thanks to the support provided by the institution, which tell us how to care for our lambs, I have had a lot of help and I have learned things that I never knew before'. This time Dona Lety is applying for this loan to buy grazing lambs and food to nourish them. She tells us that she likes caring for her lambs because her mother taught her how to do it and now she has been able to support her family economically,  which proves that her earnings have helped her a lot. She has used her earnings to improve her house; next she would like to build an entrance hall on to her home. Dona Lety and the rest of the group are very grateful to the institution and to Kiva for the loans that they grant and all the services they provide, such as the training and the discounts which are great, Dona Lety says while smiling, 'To me, the discounts are a great help as with the money that I save, I will be able to be buy her children's graduation dress and an extra little gift.'"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1228748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is a very pretty and large community; above all it is very large. There are seven members in the bank and all are women. They themselves chose the name of their group and they say they chose this name because there is a \"pozito\" or small pool near where they meet, which has been there for several years. \r\n\r\nThe members of the bank are all very hardworking and enterprising people with productive businesses. Thus they are requesting a loan from FRAC. They include, for example, Sras. Maria de Lourdes, Maricuz, Maria Juana, and Icela, who will purchase cleaning products to sell, while Do\u00f1a Julia will buy ceramic hotplates to sell. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Natalia, who is also part of the group, has been a client of FRAC for several years and started by requesting a small loan to invest in her business selling hotplates and T-shirts. To date she has successfully had even larger loans.\r\n\r\nShe notes that she is 50 years old and has been married to her second husband, Sr. Remigio, for the past 25 years. They have four children, of whom only one is still dependent on them. Natalia has been selling hotplates and beachwear for 30 years and started the business because she wanted to help her husbands with household expenses. She says: \u201cI enjoy selling very much because formerly I was a street vendor selling both in my own and neighboring communities, etc.  Nowadays, we are selling in the city of Mexico. My only difficulty is during the rainy seasons because usually one cannot sell when it rains all day and I don\u2019t have an established stall with all of my merchandise.\u201d  Nevertheless, the best seasons are yet to come for Natalia. Consequently she is requesting a loan from FRAC and Kiva.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Natalia\u2019s goal is to see her children become professionals. \r\n\r\nAll of the members of the bank are very grateful for the support and confidence shown by World Vision International and Kiva with the loan granted to them because it will be a great help in their productive activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6850,"image":{"id":1228904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ceramic hotplates to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":6850,"lender_count":244,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Icela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":89000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11125},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":11125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2568.75,"local_amount":33375,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":33431.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120101},{"amount":1712.5,"local_amount":22250,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":22287.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068150},{"amount":2568.75,"local_amount":33375,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":33431.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284888}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T19:53:05Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":492144,"name":"Gs Luz Y Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Martha, se dedica al comercio su actividad principal es la venta de ropa de var\u00f3n, de mujer edredones, ropa interior, ma\u00edz y frijoles, ella cuenta con mas 5 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el manejo de su negocio.\nDo\u00f1a Martha es una persona muy trabajadora, cuenta con  la clientela de la zona y a trav\u00e9s de su negocio a salido adelante, ya que ha sido una de las principales fuentes de ingresos, ella se a sabido ganar la clientela porque su manera de atenderlos es muy especial.\nDo\u00f1a Martha con el pr\u00e9stamo que reciba comprara ropa de var\u00f3n, de mujer edredones, ropa interior, ma\u00edz y frijoles, esto le contribuir\u00e1 a tener un mejor negocio, para cubrir los gastos en el hogar y  una mejor calidad de vida para su familia.\nDo\u00f1a Martha sue\u00f1a con surtir su negocio y mejorar la fachada de su casa ya que donde ella vive faltan muchos servicios p\u00fablicos.\nGicela se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, granos b\u00e1sicos, refrescos, en la comunidad donde ella habita y ambulante, desde hace 5 a\u00f1os.\nDixie su negocio es la venta de abarroteria, en una caseta ubicada en la calle principal de la comunidad donde ella vive, negocio que opera  desde hace 3 a\u00f1os contando con la clientela de la zona.\n\nDanli El Para\u00edso, Honduras - Octubre 2012\n","en":"Martha\u2019s a merchant.

The group has 11 members who are very hardworking and responsible and always try to be very punctual on any occasion when the group needs to be addressed for anything.  The group name was chosen because that\u2019s the name of the community they belong to and apparently it\u2019s in the Mazahua tongue.  The group members have requested a new loan to invest in their activities.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bibiana will invest in stuffed toys, Andr\u00e9s in goats for barbeque, In\u00e9s, Rosa and Guadalupe in chickens and turkeys, Irineo and Adelina in their vegetable crops, Martha in her grocery store, Luis in his taxi and Mar\u00eda in her piglets.\r\n\r\nJuana who also forms part of this group relates that she has four children who are still minors; the oldest has just started secondary school.  She\u2019s been married 13 years and she\u2019s 32-years-old.  She lives in a borrowed house and her husband\u2019s employed.  The place they live in is the Las Pe\u00f1as neighborhood that belongs to El Oro, M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nJuana sells plastic containers in all sizes and shapes.  She usually sells to women.  It\u2019s good quality merchandise, not brand-name but durable nonetheless.  For example, she carries sauce containers, lunch boxes, screw containers, drinking glasses and plates, among others.  Juana says that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to sell all her plastic wares because not all housewives venture to buy.  She comments that the situation is very difficult and in order to sell and earn even a little profit she lowers her prices but does not like selling on credit because she runs the risk of some people not paying her.  It\u2019s also been hard to acquire customers because people might buy something from you at the moment and then after a month or two perhaps buy something else and this is why Juana wants to have a good stock of new merchandise on hand for her customers.  There are newer, prettier styles of plastic ware than previous ones and this means that she will be able to sell them all.  It\u2019s advantageous for Juana to invest in packages and she comments that profits are higher that way and better for her because she doesn\u2019t have to go restock so often.  Her husband helps her occasionally to sell more quickly because he\u2019ll sell to his friends at work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1228785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic ware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":4850,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irineo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1818.75,"local_amount":23625,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":23670.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120110},{"amount":1212.5,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":15780.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068158},{"amount":1818.75,"local_amount":23625,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":23670.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284896}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T23:48:42Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":492514,"name":"Beatrice Bih","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is married and blessed with six children, four of them under fifteen years of age.

Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana es una persona mayor de edad conoce muy bien de donde naci\u00f3 el bordado y el tejido de la comunidad, ella tiene 69 a\u00f1os de edad ya es viuda ahora vive sola pero muy cercas de sus hijos y casi pasa todo el d\u00eda con sus nietos. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana comenta que antes la lana era natural por lo que ahora ya no solo es sint\u00e9tica, antes ellos mismos elaboraban esta producto, primero lavaban la lana del borrego que sal\u00eda cuando les cortaban la lana, se hacia lino con la lana ya bien lavada y lo obten\u00edan con ayuda de un instrumento de madera, despu\u00e9s tej\u00edan todos estos hilos de lana hasta obtener una tela y finalmente pintaban la tela los colores mas comunes eran el negro, caf\u00e9 y gris. Las cosas han cambiado ahora ya nada de esto se hace porque las telas ya son de muy mala calidad. Ella bordando lleva ya 30 a\u00f1os desde que sus hijos eran peque\u00f1os comenta que esto le ayudo de mucho para darles estudios a sus hijos tambi\u00e9n ayudaba con los gastos del hogar cuando su esposo se quedaba sin empleo, vend\u00eda todos los d\u00edas lunes en Ixtlahuaca sus bordados, Ahora ya solo ofrece con sus conocidos de la comunidad esta sola y muchas veces pues no tiene para cubrir sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas como alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado y vestimenta por eso se dedica a esto, esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar estambres de colores, tela y aujas. Su desaf\u00edo es que muchas veces sus trabajo ya no lo valoran como antes y no le quieren pagar lo que realmente es el precio, comenta que es muy pasado ya que se tardan varios d\u00edas elaborando este trabajo porque todo es echo a mano, ella hace chalecos, morrales, colchas, su\u00e9teres con figuras representativas de la comunidad, como p\u00e1jaros, gretas, estrellas, flores, etc. Una de las metas de do\u00f1a Juana es llegar a vender muchos bordados para poder compra ma\u00edz, porque si no comprar no tendr\u00e1 para hacer sus tortillas durante todo el a\u00f1o ya que es uno de sus alimentos primordiales de todos los d\u00edas. Todas las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidas por el pr\u00e9stamo ya que podr\u00e1 compra todo el material que les hace falta y podr\u00e1n cumplir con sus pedidos ya atrasados. Angelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Maria, Gregoria, y Mar\u00eda Lucina invertir\u00e1n en los bordados, mientras que Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles y Juana Ir\u00edais invertir\u00e1n en cosm\u00e9ticos. ","en":"The Artesanas del Fresno group is made up of only women who are very hardworking and responsible.  They chose the name because almost all of them make a living in handicrafts (embroidery and textiles), so they're artisans, and \"Fresno\" is because of their community.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana is an older person.  She's very familiar with the origins of embroidery and weaving in the community.  She's 69 years old and a widow.  She lives alone now, but very close to her children, and she spends almost all day with her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana says that in the past yarn was natural, but that now it's only synthetic.  They used to make it themselves.  First they washed the wool that came from the sheep when they sheared it.  They made linen with the well-cleaned wool, with the help of a wooden implement.  Then they wove all this wool thread until they had fabric.  Finally they dyed the fabric; the most common colors were black, brown, and grey.\r\n\r\nThings have changed, and now none of this is done because the fabrics are of very poor quality.  She has been embroidering for 30 years, since her children were little.  She says this helped a lot, so she could give her children an education.  It also helped with the household expenses when her husband didn't have a job.  She sold her embroidery in Ixtlahuaca every Monday.  Now she only sells to acquaintances in the community.  She's alone and often doesn't have enough money to cover her basic necessities like food, shoes, and clothing.  This is why she does this.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan to buy colored yarn, fabric, and needles.\r\n\r\nHer challenge is that often her work isn't valued as it was before, and people don't want to pay the true price.  She says it's very old-fashioned; it takes several days to do this kind of work because everything is handmade.

With the new loan she has requested, she will buy hair products, like hair mesh, hair oil, hair treatments and hair caps, buy jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, bangles and watches, buy inner wear and chicks. She holds a strong view on her business succeeding because of longevity in the business and regular customers, and she also has a good site to maintain customers and attract new ones. With this business, the community will maintain beauty at moderate prices, the chick will serve in ceremonial activities and the droppings from the chick will serve as manure for agriculture which will improve yields.\r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will be used for her child\u2019s education, feeding her family, and also she will reinvest some of the profit back into her business to expand

They live in Bamenda, Mezam Division of the Northwest Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nThis widow has faced many challenges.  She has fought over her husband's properties with her in-laws who want to take everything away from her.  Her husband, who was so supportive of her at an early age, died, leaving her to raise her children alone and educate and feed them.  Her father died at a very tender age, and she did not have a good foundation In school.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in 2007, and has taken and successfully repaid three loans.  She says if given the new loan she has requested, she will buy salon items like a hair drier, hair mesh, hair oil, and men's caps, and buy cups, flour and other items which will facilitate the smooth functioning of her restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe is positive her business will succeed because she has a good business site, her restaurant is always very neat, attracting new customers and retaining old ones.  She does the heads of customers well and this attracts new customers to her salon.  With this salon, the community will not travel long distances in search of food or to do their hair.  Men will also buy caps from her at low prices and all of her products will be of good quality.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from the loan, she will plough back, invest in agriculture and also buy farm seedlings.  She says GHAPE loans are preferable because of the low interest rate and convenient repayment intervals.

After heavy rains this spring, Halima's roof began to leak.  But at that time she didn't have enough money for the repairs, so the roof went unmended.  Now the rains have started again and roof repairs are absolutely necessary.  On receiving her loan, Halima wants to buy building materials and finally fix her leaky roof.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their financial

He's single and lives in the town of Chincha with his parents and siblings. He's a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person with a great deal of drive to overcome. Unfortunately, due to the lack of financial resources and the need to work in order to help his parents pay for their household's expenses, he couldn't study for a professional career in welding. However, he hopes to be able to do that very soon. During his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his friends. Occasionaly, he eats a delicious \"arroz con pur\u00e9\" (rice with mashed potatoes), which is his favorite dish.\r\nWith a lot of hard work and dedication, Jonathan works in the grocery section of one of his town's supermarkets. Everyday he starts working from the early hours of the morning. He may work for about 8 hours, and he believes that he does well because he's very responsible and treats other people in a friendly way.\r\nJonathan is very thankful to Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he'll be able to do home improvements.

Mohamad was only 15 years old when he started his own business, as it was necessary for him to help his parents earn a living when he finished his intermediate studies.\r\n\r\nMohamad's cafe is in a van located on the side of a highway facing an auto showroom.  His location is very good but he needs support to improve his business. That is why he has applied for a youth loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua in order to buy a new espresso machine and an espresso coffee mill.  In addition, he wants to build a tent over his van to make his business easier during the coming winter season.  Most of his customers are passersby and tourists.\r\n\r\nThis is his third cycle with Al Mjamoua and he is a borrower in good standing with a history of repaying his previous loans.  Mohamad hopes to continue expanding his business as much as he can to please his customers and improve his standard of

She harvests the honey and sells it at the local open market. In addition, her mother trades with cereals. Their income is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLali has requested loan from Credo to start up a new family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country-residing rural poor, who do not have access to traditional credit products,--they are typically regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Lali requested credit for the start-up of a grocery store with a sharer. With the requested credit she will purchase grocery products for resale. According to her estimations, her store will work well, as there are no other similar stores. She will attract clients with quality service and a wide assortment of products.\r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living

Together they have seven children and they all live in a house made from adobe.  She loves the country and has spent 25 years cultivating coffee.  She plants her crops on land inherited from her parents and they have used this to help their family get ahead.  Mauricio, her right hand, is always consistent with his work and indicated that without teamwork they would not have been able to succeed.  One of the things that fascinates Roberta is that harvesting the grains pleases and relaxes her, so in consequence, she is faster than the hired day laborers.  Nevertheless, hard work like moving the sacks leaves her exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue producing, she needs to acquire coffee seeds as well as organic fertilizer to guarantee a quality crop.  She hopes to continue saving so that she can later open a grocery store.  This is her 17th loan and she remains committed to working with MFP, so she will make her payments on time.  She thanks her fellow community bank members ahead of time for their welcome and the motivation they provide.

He has four dependent children.

In addition to her store, she sells cosmetics and snacks on the weekends in the market in San Raymundo.. She tells us that she is applying for this loan to be able to stock her store by buying grocery products and some Christmas fruits, since the season is coming in which she sells this product year after year, and people already know about it, so she doesn't want this year to be an exception. Now she needs capital to invest. With her work and effort she has been able to raise her daughters, but she has had difficult moments because her husband has been very sick and so hasn't been able to work well, and what he earns at times they can only use for medicine, since he is in treatment for his illness. Now she hopes that FAPE can help her continue striving for her family and especially for her daughters, who are in school and need many things.\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1225647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo, Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Coralia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":581.97,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":587.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981691},{"amount":74.64,"local_amount":580.53,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":585.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331965396},{"amount":74.8,"local_amount":581.78,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":586.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339745104},{"amount":62.15,"local_amount":483.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":487.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347062170},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":581.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":586.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489256},{"amount":111.07,"local_amount":863.87,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":871.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515603},{"amount":110.6,"local_amount":860.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":867.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373129754},{"amount":76.05,"local_amount":591.48,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":596.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381935060},{"amount":76.48,"local_amount":594.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":600.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390798598},{"amount":153.59,"local_amount":1194.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410086279},{"amount":10.99,"local_amount":85.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":86.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419852702}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T23:42:23Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T14:48:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":492582,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 28 years old and a single parent.

Marleni is requesting this loan in order to purchase animals for her business, such as guinea pigs, pigs and chickens, and to buy feed for her animals as well.\r\n\r\nThe other group members work in various trades, including: vegetable sales, corn sales, operating grocery and general stores, and animal sales.\r\n\r\nMarleni is grateful for this opportunity and for the lenders who make her dream possible, and she promises to make prompt loan repayments\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":1230131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase guinea pigs, pigs, chickens, as well as animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1837.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1910.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1986.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2064.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":683.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":710.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":738.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":798.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":683.56,"local_amount":1767.44,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322935501},{"amount":710.67,"local_amount":1837.54,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1845.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331067949},{"amount":738.87,"local_amount":1910.43,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339456230},{"amount":768.18,"local_amount":1986.24,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1994.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347008955},{"amount":798.64,"local_amount":2064.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2074.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355751424},{"amount":825.08,"local_amount":2133.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2142.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364455805}],"funded_date":"2012-11-21T00:14:25Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:16:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":492584,"name":"Hashem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hashem is from Iraq.

She raised and educated her three children as a single mother. Now they are grown and independent, and they live together in the house she owns. Eldith's work is selling clothing and cosmetics from catalogs - colognes and perfumes are her best sellers. She works every day, looking for friends, neighbors and family members to sell products to or deliver those that have been ordered ahead of time. She has been doing this for around 10 years, working alone since she is the only one covering the costs for her household. In addition, she sells food on the weekends at the sports park, which allows her to have a flow of customers on those days. It's going well because she doesn't have a lot of expenses and she sells enough to pay for her basic needs. In the future she would like to start selling clothing to take advantage of the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nThis is her 6th loan with the institution MFP, and she thanks everyone who has given her the opportunity to access a loan so that she could make her plans a reality.

She is a single mother who has four children, and two of her children are in school. In addition, she cares for two other family members (her old parents). \r\n\r\nKasifa sells green bananas at the market on a retail basis. She works for six days a week. It has been ten years since she started this business. She has applied for a loan of 400,000 UGX, to buy more bunches of green bananas for sale. Her business challenges are seasonality and transportation. \r\n\r\nKasifa\u2019s goals and aspirations are to become a wholesaler, to buy a delivery van to make transportation of her fruit easier, and also to buy land and build rental houses. She decided to work with MCDT, because services are simple and therefore easy to access. She rents the house she stays in, and the family has access to electricity but not to piped water.

The challenges of her business are transportation and seasonality.  \r\n\r\nSome of her goals and aspirations are to buy land, to grow vegetables herself in a way that increases her sales, and to educate her children up to university.

She is married and has three small children with whom she gives all her love and all the care they need. They all live together in their own home, and Karen works very hard to improve their quality of life. Karen provides distinct copying services, monographs and didactic drawings. She has a photocopier that she purchased some years ago with the help of her husband and installed it in a space in her home where she tends to customers every day. Luckily, her home is located in front of a kindergarten and near an elementary school, which helps her have permanent customers. She has only been working for two years and it is going very well since her income is stable. What she likes about her job is that she has time to care for her children and do household chores, as well as feeling like she is contributing to children's education by giving them the opportunity to have photocopied texts to help them do their homework. She wants to set up her business with school supplies and increase her profits. This will be her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is grateful to those who have made this possible to help her achieve her objectives. With the loan, she plans to purchase paper, printer ink and some office supplies like pens, pencils and erasers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1230466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase paper, printer ink and some office supplies like pens, pencils and erasers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":127.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":136.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":142.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.65,"local_amount":119.76,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":126.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053820},{"amount":51.79,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":134.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188754},{"amount":51.59,"local_amount":126.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572656},{"amount":55.64,"local_amount":136.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":144.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122322},{"amount":57.72,"local_amount":142.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":149.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868140},{"amount":59.61,"local_amount":146.73,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576965}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T06:20:16Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":492633,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente (pictured from left to right with his daughter, father and wife) and his family are farmers who live in the foothills of the Malinche volcano in the state of Tlaxcala.

She is married and has two children who are grown up and independent. Kelita makes a living primarily in the cultivation of ornamental plants. She has a garden area at her home where she grows a wide variety of plants used for decorations at homes and botanical gardens. She grows roses, daises, gardenias and other flowers, which she sells in small pots when they bloom and reach an adequate vegetation period for the climate. She has had this business for more than five years and enjoys carrying out her work. She also works as a seamstress out of her home, since she has a sewing machine. She also teaches some classes. What she most likes about her work with plants is seeing the variety of flowers in bloom and the bright colors they have. She also enjoys making articles of clothing as a seamstress, but at the moment she can't do that job since her sewing machine doesn't work. She hopes to continue growing her plants, which will be even more vigorous. This will be her eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she has always been a very good member of her community bank, where she is much-loved for being very responsible and supportive.
