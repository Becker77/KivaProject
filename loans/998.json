Together, they strive to meet their goals for the future.  They now live in a wooden house on property that belonged to her mother.  Because of her age, she decided to get out of the agriculture business and start a unisex hair salon service.  She and Juan, who also has experience in the sector, have been in business for eight years.  So working together has been a great motivation for them both.  Many of their customers are friends and neighbors who know how well they work, and how they have been able to turn the business into a more profitable source of income, since their activity is carried out on their own property.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to make some improvements in the salon and replace some of her work tools in order to make work flow more easily.  One of her goals for the future is to expand her activity by opening a roast chicken business because she is predicting a high demand from neighbors and visitors to the area.  This is her 13th loan and she has always paid them back on time.  She believes the help from MFP has been favorable to her on more than one occasion.  She also believes that working through her communal bank is the way to grow alongside her neighbors and friends who are in the group.  She will use the 500 PEN to buy beauty supplies and renovate her salon somewhat.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1230819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty supplies and renovate her salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.75,"local_amount":54.37,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":56.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053825},{"amount":21.92,"local_amount":54.81,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":56.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188760},{"amount":24.15,"local_amount":60.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572663},{"amount":24.94,"local_amount":62.35,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":64.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122329},{"amount":25.76,"local_amount":64.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":66.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868147},{"amount":25.92,"local_amount":64.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":67.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576971},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":68.65,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529298},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":70.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":72.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974427}],"funded_date":"2012-11-08T17:20:05Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":492624,"name":"Jose Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9 vive en la ciudad de Quevedo Provincia de los R\u00edos tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 soltero.

She does this in an itinerant manner and by orders from her customers.\r\n\r\nThis loan that she has requested is her third loan, and it is for 7,500 lempiras.  She will use it to buy more clothes, creams, shampoo, lotions, deodorants, and other personal hygiene products in order to increase her inventory and fill the customer orders that are pending.  Her goal is to grow spiritually and to have a small clothing store in a fixed place.  She also wants to continue working in order to always have quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1229795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothes, creams, shampoo, lotions, deodorants, and other personal hygiene products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tela, Atlantida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":418.54},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":532.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":550.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":568.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":587.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":607.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":627.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":648.27},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":669.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":692.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":715.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":882.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.32,"local_amount":418.54,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":440.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323083493},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":532.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":560.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332035259},{"amount":29.35,"local_amount":550.24,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":578.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339605926},{"amount":61.66,"local_amount":1156.11,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356559518},{"amount":32.38,"local_amount":607.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":638.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364614326},{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":627.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":659.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382006772},{"amount":70.3,"local_amount":1318.15,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1386.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390869773},{"amount":36.92,"local_amount":692.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T17:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":728.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410186821},{"amount":38.15,"local_amount":715.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T19:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":752.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419950271},{"amount":47.06,"local_amount":882.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":928.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430129933}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T00:30:11Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:14:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":492759,"name":"Isidro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isidro, 48, is married with 3 children; he resides in Kaparalan, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines.

This will help him to meet customer demand and to bolster his sales and his profits. \r\n\r\nHe plans to use these profits to expand his activity and turn it into a large hardware store, and to provide for his family\u2019s needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1231762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to stock up on hardware items such as light bulbs, paint, sheet metal, thinners, buckets, etc. for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mokote","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20624},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21419},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22216},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23011},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23806},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24602},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25397},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26193},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26989},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27785},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":28580},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":29378}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.25,"local_amount":20624,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":21082.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339437058},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":21419,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":21895.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989473},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":22216,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356623084},{"amount":46.02,"local_amount":23011,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":23522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437230},{"amount":47.61,"local_amount":23806,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":24335.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842285},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":24602,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25149.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610300},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":25397,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25961.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390467856},{"amount":52.39,"local_amount":26193,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":26775.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399723858},{"amount":53.97,"local_amount":26989,"processed_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":27589.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409992862},{"amount":171.49,"local_amount":85743,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":87649.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419757462}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T00:50:19Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T09:51:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":492791,"name":"Marietta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marietta is a new recognized member of PMPC under the individual program.

One problem that I have is that the animals have nowhere to stay, so I have lost a few since they cannot be contained.  I also need to have them vaccinated so that they will not come down with bird flu.  The loan will be a benefit because I have a son who is in elementary school, so I will be able to pay for a few of his school supplies.  My goal is to build a house because my husband and I live at my mother\u2019s house.  I am not married, but we have a common-law relationship.  He works as a bricklayer.

This work enables her to generate income to support her family economically as she is married and has four children.\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes sharing the training and health information with her friends.\r\nOne of the members, Vicky, is not in the photo due to cultural reasons. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5225,"image":{"id":1230894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicky\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Martha\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36040.61,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2625.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3036.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1261.52,"local_amount":8701.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8716.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235622},{"amount":880.82,"local_amount":6075.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6086.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617455},{"amount":880.82,"local_amount":6075.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6086.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172049},{"amount":2201.84,"local_amount":15187.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15213.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914267}],"funded_date":"2012-12-07T18:39:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":490844,"name":"Santo Domingo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n  Este grupo se llama \"Santo Domingo\" y  se integra de tres se\u00f1oras quien cada una tiene su diferente actividad y vive un pueblo llamado Tecpatan que esta a una hora de Copa\u00ednala.\n\n  La se\u00f1ora Normaida, es quien se  le tomo la entrevista es ama de casa, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Luciano, y con quien procreo cinco hijos, 3 ta estan casadoos y 2 todav\u00eda est\u00e1n a su responsabilidad;

He has no other loans with state banks and Fudecosur has offered the best terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1228856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Altamira, Biolley","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T18:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T18:50:11Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Andrey ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.63,"local_amount":77062.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79718.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515872},{"amount":60.02,"local_amount":28972.98,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":29971.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067726},{"amount":61.22,"local_amount":29553.88,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":30572.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381937640},{"amount":57.03,"local_amount":27530.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":28479.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059252},{"amount":141.32,"local_amount":68224,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70575.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459101109},{"amount":41.54,"local_amount":20205.07,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20901.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":479136960},{"amount":95.05,"local_amount":45886.77,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":47468.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256831},{"amount":108.88,"local_amount":52564.32,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":54376.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540380}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T13:12:39Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:28:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":492680,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilson Lujan de 37 a\u00f1os un hombre de ardua dedicaci\u00f3n y trabajo tiene como compa\u00f1era de vida a Edy de 33 a\u00f1os con quien tiene 2 alegr\u00edas que son sus hijos Juan y Juliana de 6 y 3 a\u00f1os, actualmente viven en una casa de material noble que alquilan para comodidad de sus peque\u00f1os.

Division of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. \r\n\r\nThis woman has faced so many challenges in life including the death of her sister after lying in the hospital for several months, so that all her money was spent in the hospital.  After her sister's death, she could not provide three square meals to her family.  Thieves also stole her goods in the market,  leaving her with no capital to continue her business. She was sick for several months, and could not pay for her medication due to inadequate finances.\r\n\r\nDorothy Manka'a joined GHAPE in the year 2003, and has taken out and successfully repaid her loans five times. She promises that with the new loan requested, she will buy more food ingredients for her restaurant business like vegetable oil, flour, beans, koki beans, rice, tomatoes, onions and Maggi. She thinks this business will succeed because her business is situated near a school, where students buy from her during breaks.  She sells puff puff, which people buy and eat alongside tea for breakfast.  Her food is in high demand in that locality because of scarcity of restaurants. \r\n\r\nWith this business activity, the community members will not travel long distances in search food.  She also educates the community on how to prepare good food so that they can also engage in the business.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will pay her children's school fees and provide their basic educational needs like text books, pens, pencils and exercise books.  She will also take care of her family's health and plough back into the business.  A GHAPE loan is preferable to her because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and no collateral security before the loans are disbursed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1230637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded

He lives in Khoni District with his mother and brother. The family runs a small dairy business of a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. They sell their dairy products locally. Mamuka has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan programs extend business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor. These families do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

She has faced some problems in life, among which are the death of one of her family members, illness, and inadequate capital to start up a business. \r\n \r\nShe plans to use the loan she requested as follows: Buy coca yams in bags, buy palm oil in tins, buy fish in bulk. Also, part of the loan will be used to invest in all the spices that will be used in cooking the food. She believes that her restaurant business will succeed, because she has being cooking and selling food for a long time. Her existing, regular customers provide an available market for her food. Also, the increasing number of schools in the town of Bamenda greatly act as a market for prepared food, which is another reason to expect the business to succeed. From this restaurant business, the community will be able to consume good-quality, always-ready cooked food. They also will not need to go long distances to buy cooked food.\r\n \r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will educate her children, pay rent for their home, and provide all the basic needs for her children, like medical care.   She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rates on loans and the training that is given by

She is 36 years old. She is in a common law marriage with Carlos. Together they have formed a family with their four children who go to school.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Lourdes was in a large group. This time, she has asked for an individual loan to invest in her business selling live and butchered chickens, as they have an order too big and she believes she can\u2019t cover the expenses, so she says with the loan she will buy more chickens and also some sweets to sell in her chicken business.\r\n\r\nShe also has a grocery store but also makes food for the teachers who are giving classes in the community. She doesn\u2019t know the amount because she buys little by little.\r\n\r\nLourdes has been in the business seven years buying live chickens at a low price and later selling them from home at a higher price and almost always she has many orders from home or in the nearby communities.\r\n\r\nShe says that she began her business because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses in order to improve the quality of life for her and her family. However, the biggest difficulty that Lourdes faces is when there is no activity, and almost no sales, and even worse when she has many chickens not sold, but this does not discourage her as she knows that if not sold today, tomorrow will be better.\r\n\r\nOne of Lourdes goals is to improve the quality of life for her and her family and more than anything to improve the education of her children who she wants to finish school in order to have a better life. She is very happy and grateful for the loan as with her earnings she can buy shoes, food, and clothing for the children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1228769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and sweets for her business, selling from home and in the nearby communities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-09T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-09T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2048.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2096.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2145.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2195.63},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2246.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2299.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2352.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2407.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2464.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2521.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2640.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":322.01,"local_amount":4145.48,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4190.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120095},{"amount":337.3,"local_amount":4342.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4389.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068143},{"amount":535.92,"local_amount":6899.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6974.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284881},{"amount":378.35,"local_amount":4871.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4925.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199171},{"amount":601.42,"local_amount":7741.26,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7826.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595978}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T16:00:59Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":492720,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angelina es una mujer de 51 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, ella tiene 2 hijos ya mayores, a quienes ama y son su principal raz\u00f3n en la vida, por diversas razones Angelina se separ\u00f3 de su esposo desde hace muchos a\u00f1os, desde entonces ella ha sido padre y madres para sus hijos, ella es una persona muy amable, trabajadora, que tiene muchos deseos por salir adelante;

The challenges she is facing are bad debts and lack of enough capital to expand her business.  She feels this issue will be helped in part by this new application\/loan.\r\nMartha is applying for a loan of 41,900 Kenya shillings to buy vegetables in wholesale and retail stock of e.g. soap, sugar etc. The extra income from the loan will be added to her savings to expand the business and pay for her children's school fees.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMary Jane oversees the operation of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one jeepney with a capacity of 14 - 16 persons, which generates a boundary payment (a daily rental fee paid by the driver) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in her local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and to maintain the jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams of giving her family a good life and hopes to give her child a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is married and her husband is a driver. They have three children between the ages of 14 and 26, who live at home and are currently in school.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years she has been selling fashion clothes in the local market. She started this business by selling on a table in front of her house with 1,000 LRD that she received from her fiancee. Her profits are used on food and school fees.

husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\nJacklen is a 54-year-old woman. She is a housewife and a mother to one son. Her husband earns a pension which is low and not enough to cover the family's need.\r\nJacklen wants to offer better house living conditions to her family, so she is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a refrigerator which the family will use for preserving food at their house. Taking this loan will create healthy and suitable living conditions for Jacklen and her family. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband works as a singer and gets a monthly salary. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they sow onions on the family-owned land. In addition, Irma purchases nuts and produces Churchkhela (traditional Georgian sausage-shaped candies, produced with grape must, flour and nuts threaded onto a string) which is sold in the capital city. Irma is very hard-working young woman, with a great desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to cultivate the plot of land and purchase onion seeds.

She is a housewife and her husband is employed. However, he gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the costs.\r\n\r\nMaysa needs to change her old bedroom furniture, so she is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture. This will enable Maysa and her husband to enjoy healthy and comfortable sleep and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The group is made up of six members, all of whom have a business:  Artemio and Martha invest in sheep, Teresa in pigs, Jacinto in blender goblets and Abel in chickens.  It was these same members who chose the name of the group, because the representative in whose house they meet grew cempazuchitl flowers, which are used to decorate offerings on the Day of the Dead or are placed on tombs.  One of the group's members, Alfredo, is a 39-year-old man who is obviously very responsible and always cheerful, whatever the circumstances.  He is married to Mar\u00eda del Carmen, with whom he has had 7 children, only 3 of whom are currently still dependent on him.  Alfredo is applying for this loan as he is in the plastics trade; in fact, he has six years' experience of selling blender goblets.  Every 8 or 15 days, when he needs stock, he goes to a nearby village called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec when he stocks up with what he needs.  He goes from door to door trying to sell his goods and, occasionally, sells them at the street market.  He decided to set up his business as a means of supporting his family after his job in Mexico City finished and he was left unemployed.  \"The only problem is almost always lack of money\" says Alfredo, who says that he also grows vegetables, mainly coriander, radishes, cauliflowers and broccoli.  Alfredo is a very hardworking and responsible person who needs a financial boost.

This photo was taken inside his barber shop.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years Mohammad has had a barber shop, which is the only shop of this kind in the place where he is. He has a good reputation among customers, which has been profitable for his business. He has a lot of loyal customers, but the shop needs some support to cover the costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new barber kit, which has tools such as different types of hair scissors, a collection of hair brushes, and hair and face creams. This will improve his work and satisfy the desires of his customers, which will lead to increased demand from his customers and an increase in income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Anvar is 50 years old, married, and has one son. Unfortunately, he was unable to afford to pay for an education for his son, so his son currently works in the Russian Federation and tries to send money to his parents whenever possible. Anvar's wife works from home sewing traditional national pillows and mattresses. Anvar is a stomatologist and treats his clients at home where he has all the necessary equipment. However, all his earnings go towards supporting his family. Now that the rainy weather of autumn has arrived, Anvar wants to repair the roof of his house because it has been leaking for the past 2 years. He will use the loan money to buy construction materials to fix his roof before winter. Anvar thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

She began with 5 head of livestock. Her husband works in construction as an assistant foreman, and in his free time, he helps his wife. Madina is now trying to develop her business, as this is the main source of income for the family. She will use the loan money to buy more livestock to increase her herd. She is very grateful to Arvand for assisting low- and middle-income people to realize their plans and improve their standard of living.

woman. She is married and has 3 children. For over 12 years, Mahbuba and her husband have been keeping livestock, and presently have around 7 sheep and goats. Mahbuba keeps the animals at her home. She is an expert in the intricacies of her business and knows well when to purchase and when to sell livestock. In addition, the family has a garden where they grow fruit and vegetables. In spring and summer, Mahbuba's husband sells their harvest at the market. Their eldest son is presently working in Russia and, if possible, sends money to his parents every month.

Mendsuren supports her family by selling clothing at two retail stalls in the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She began her business in 2002, and it has grown so that today she has 2,100,000 Mongollian Tugriks (MNT) in working capital.

A native of a municipality in the department of Bolivar, she learned to make handicrafts, which are recognizable as part of the traditional culture of her native San Jacinto.

This is why she is applying for a Kiva loan, which will be her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and which she will use to buy brooches, hairpins, patches for backpacks, and thread, fabrics, and gems.

En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1 ropa, y jugueter\u00eda, que son los art\u00edculos que mas vende  en el mes de Diciembre, experiencia que ha consolidado en sus 4 a\u00f1os de tener el negocio, apoyado por su suegra, quien como habita en Los Estados Unidos, le env\u00eda todo lo que necesita y  que los almacenes ofrecen con  descuentos,  porque han pasado las temporadas en las cuales son compradas por los norteamericanos y estos dejan de adquirirlas. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y tambi\u00e9n de contado a sus principales clientes, que son los vecinos de su sector,  quienes  diariamente pasan por su miscel\u00e1nea de Vanessa para conocer que tiene de nuevo y comprarle.  ","en":"Vanessa, 25, lives in Cartagena de Indias, a beautiful, historic, coastal city on the shores of the Colombian Caribbean.  She has a variety store there where she sells a little bit of everything, especially clothes from the United States of America her mother-in-law sends her from there.  Vanessa lives with her spouse and little six-year-old son who she dreams with seeing become a very successful person.  This is why she works persistently to reach her goal.  Vanessa takes advantage of all seasons of the year to invest in her business and this final one of the year that\u2019s filled with family gatherings is no exception because there is cash circulating in the streets and everyone is ready to spend.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy clothes and toys which is what she sells most in December, something she\u2019s learned from her four years\u2019 experience in business.   She gets support from her mother-in-law who lives in the United States; she sends her everything she needs that's on sale in stores because it's off-season and North Americans aren\u2019t buying any longer.  She sells on credit and also for cash to her main customers who are her local neighbors who come by Vanessa\u2019s variety store daily to see what new things she has available for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1231463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
