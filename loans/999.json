and has three children. Her husband works as a construction worker. Looking for an additional source of income for her family, she began an animal raising business in 1991 from a starting capital of 5,000 soms (KGS). She successfully ran her business and was able to start growing various grain crops that she sells for profit and uses as fodder for her cattle. She also grows potatoes. Ainur also earns money by working as a cook in a local school. Thus, her family has a monthly budget of up to 25,000 soms (KGS). \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business further, Ainur approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan of 135,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase some cows with calves and several heads of small-horned cattle. She wants to increase her business using profits from the loan. In the future, she plans to marry off her daughter and to improve the living conditions of her cattle by building a new barn.

","en":"Elenora is 38 years old, married and has two children. She's a very interesting, good willing and responsible person. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Elenora received some land and build a farm, which become her main source of income. Elenora's husband has a lot of experience in running farms and helps out in maintaining and developing their business.\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work and determination, her farm is in very good condition. She began her business 20 years ago with a starting capital of 5,000 soms; today, she owns 6 cows and 10 bulls. She's able to sell milk on a daily basis. Her monthly income is around 8,000 soms (KGS). \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business even further, Elenora approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan of 70,000 soms (KGS) in order to purchase 3 bulls for fattening and resale. Elenora plans to invest the profits from the loan into her business and increase her herd head count, then repair her home and improve her living conditions. In the future, she dreams of buying an apartment in the city of Karakol.

Her family is her only concern in life, and she always aims to provide them with a better living, especially since they are Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and don't have the same minimum decent living standard as others do. For this reason, Zeinat helps her husband by operating her small clothing shop, which she opened in 2009, after seven years of prior experience in this field.

He learned his trade while working in a handbag factory and gradually began adapting his technical equipment; first of all, he bought a table top sewing machine and then a trimmer, and gradually started to build up his clientele.  This led him to go it alone in his own business venture.  He currently forms part of an outsourcing chain which supplies different stores, who, in turn, supply basic materials, such as leather and handicrafts purchased from the Wayuu tribe, in Guajira department, in the North of Colombia.  At the same time, he also works freelance, designing, cutting, sewing and finishing items.  He sells his goods on credit, while he pays in cash in the specialized stores where he goes to buy leather and other supplies necessary for the production of his goods.\n\nHis aim is to expand his business and add to it by employing more technology in his processes.  But his greatest challenge is to build up sufficient working capital to carry out his expansion plans.  He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first funding, from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to enable him to buy a butt-seaming machine and materials such as thread and buckles.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Fanik is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nFanik has two years of experience with her small home-based sewing and tailoring activity, making custom order dresses and household items made of fabric, such as curtains and drapes, sheets and towels. She would like to improve her work and take more orders. As the city has frequent and random power outages, Fanik finds it difficult to plan her work time. To be able to plan better and work more hours on the sewing machine, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine to work with, as well as a table and a chair to make her work area a little more comfortable.

She has a business selling a variety of underwear and lingerie.  She has a stall located in one of the busiest areas in the city of Santa Cruz.  This will be her 8th loan with the institution.  Ilsen will use this loan to buy merchandise at wholesale for her business. The reason she is requesting a loan is that she lacks the capital to buy merchandise for her business.  \r\n\r\nIlsen really likes the attention that we give her, and the way that Kiva works.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Katan is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has five years experience with the small home-based business activity. To be able to offer better quality products and a variety of services to her customers, she would like to replace her sewing machine for a newer one and buy some quality fabrics and raw materials. To pay for these purchases she took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She is a single mother and has adult children who are independent. When her ex-husband abandoned her, she had to find a way to meet the household expenses, and it was then, already 15 years ago, that she decided to set up a store selling groceries in general, since there was no grocery store in her neighborhood. She presently works from Monday to Sunday from 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening. With the loan, Alba will buy rice, oil, sugar, etc. Her goal is to be able to have a mini market so that she can thus increase her

This Accion Texas Inc. loan is Jorge\u2019s third with the non-profit microlender. He is using the funds for working capital, gas expenses and supplies.\r\n\r\nJorge\u2019s business doesn\u2019t have a website, social media page or even a mention in the city\u2019s phone book, but successfully operates on word of mouth from people like probation officers and pediatricians. He says, without the loan, he would still be in business but without the financial security to fully and securely operate.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1231421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to

Bayarsaikhan has been working as a freestyle wrestling coach since he graduated from the professional university in 1992. From 2006-2012 he worked as the state coach for the Olympic participants of Mongolia. Once his mission was completed, he returned to his hometown. He rented out his apartment while he was working in Ulaanbaatar. Now his apartment is in disrepair due to several other people who had rented his apartment. Therefore, Bayarsaikhan is planning to make some improvements to his apartment, such as changing all electricity cables to prevent fires, installing double-glazed windows and an electric radiant floor heating system, and thickening the house walls to stop heat loss. Bayarsaikhan said that the government gave him this apartment in 2002 in gratitude for his contribution to the development of freestyle wrestling in Mongolia. Therefore, he loves this house very much. The loan Bayarsaikhan is taking out will be used to maintain his house in order to stop the heat loss through the windows and walls. Also, he mentioned that his dream is to bring the Olympic gold medal in freestyle wrestling to Mongolia .

Her husband has owned the barber shop for eight years, and it has been the only one of its type in the village.  Salam and her husband consider the shop a profitable project. It has many loyal customers, but also it needs more support from time to time, to cover the costs. \r\n\r\nSalam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the cost of purchasing a new barber kit, installing mirrors, and obtaining some necessary cosmetics, such as hair and face creams. These purchases will improve the shop's work and satisfy customers, which in turn will increase the family's income. They will then have better living conditions.

Now it needs more support to cover the costs. Suliman wants to meet the increasing demand from customers in less time, so he is requesting a 1,500 USD loan from FATEN. He will use the loan to cover the cost of purchasing another sewing machine. This will improve his work and satisfy his customers. It will also increase the amount of work he can do each day, which will improve his income. As a result, he will be able to create better living conditions for the family.

This is 49-year-old Isata from Kulanda town, Bo,  in a southern area of Sierra Leone. She is married with 5 children between the ages of 10 years and 29 years. Three of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nIsata runs a palm oil business; she sells palm oil at her house. She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day, 11 hours per day. Her husband is a businessman,  and she also receives income from him.  Isata says that the main challenge to her business is that the road network to the place she usually purchases her goods is very poor \r\n\r\nIsata has requested a loan in order to  buy more local foodstuff such as gari (cassava flakes), pepper and palm oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her installment quickly and to increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a nice house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1231982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 40-year-old Sallu from Kulanda town, in  Bo, a southern area of Sierra Leone. He is married with 4 children between the ages of 2 years and 18 years. His children attend school. He is seeking this loan because he wants to develop himself and his family. \r\n\r\nSallu runs a clothing business.  He sells shirts, jeans, blouses, bags, and shoes.  He has been running this business for 10 years. He works at the business 8 hours a day and 6 days per week, and has two relatives that working for him. He also has a bike that he uses for transportation and to bring another income into the home. Sallu says that the major problems for his business are the high cost of transportation and, sometimes, low purchasing power of customers.  \r\n\r\nSallu has requested a loan to purchase more clothing such as shirts, jeans, blouses, bags and shoes. The extra income from this loan will allow him to educate his children and increase his business. In the future, he hopes to open a clothing factory. He thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1231971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more clothing such as shirts, jeans, blouses, bags and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kulanda town Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":183,"posted_date":"2012-11-10T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-10T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sallu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":408285},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":423032},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":438311},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":454143},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":470546},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":487542},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":505151},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":523397},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":542301},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":561889},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":582184},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":603219}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.8},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Nethery","image":268367}},{"id":493253,"name":"Donsu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2009, these tribal women created a platform for themselves and formed a group of 10 members called Donsu where they can help one another to generate income for a better future. \r\n\r\nThey live in a village in the hills of Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India bordering Myanmar. Agriculture is still the main occupation in this part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe woman with raised hand is called Mathiuboniu. She is 25 years old and is a mother to a son, 6, and a daughter, 4. Both her children go to a private school which is 3 km from her village. In her new home she lives with her husband and one brother-in-law (21 years old). Her husband is a lorry truck driver by profession and the brother in-law is a trained carpenter.\r\n \r\nIn 2009, with her first loan of INR 5,000, she invested in ginger farming, employing her brother-in-law. With the good harvest she profited INR 15,000. Without spending a penny and with her husband's help, she invested in buying equipment and tools to open a carpentry workshop for her brother-in-law. Eventually, the carpentry workshop became a good investment for her. Today she can employ two more carpenters to assist her brother in-law. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan of INR 10,000, she continued her ginger farming on a bigger scale. Unfortunately she was unable to reap a good harvest due to rodents and she suffered a great loss. However she was able to repay her loan from the carpentry investment.\r\n \r\nShe needs another loan and this time she wishes to venture into selling of ready-made garments. She plans to go to a border town of Myanmar and Manipur, a trading centre with all kinds of foreign goods. With the winter season approaching, she plans to invest and use her loan for warm clothes and blankets to sell in her shop.\r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the rest of the group members have made steady improvement with their respective businesses and will use their loans to expand. The business of the members, apart from the agricultural sector, includes weaving, paan shop, laundry service, clothes, merchandise and selling of consumption commodities door to door.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1231677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy garments, especially warm clothes and blankets to sell in her village.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-10T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-10T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wisemliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathiuboniu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aningtu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilamsiliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aliuhongliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aliuboniu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pouchun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T18:33:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":493455,"name":"Jaime Benigno","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaime es un hombre de 37 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Nazca, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n; gracias a su esfuerzo y al apoyo de su familia, Jaime pudo estudiar la carrera profesional de Educaci\u00f3n, en sus ratos libre e gusta ver programas educativos en televisi\u00f3n y en algunas ocasiones cocina un riqu\u00edsimo Arroz con Mariscos para compartir con su familia.\nPor iniciativa propia, con mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, d\u00eda a d\u00eda Jaime trabaja como profesor de historia y geograf\u00eda en un centro educativo de su ciudad, todos los d\u00edas desde tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana inicia su labor, \u00e9l puede trabajar un aproximado de 10 horas y cree que le va bien porque es muy responsable y le gusta ayudar a los dem\u00e1s.\nJaime se encuentra muy agradecido con los prestatarios Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada podr\u00e1 realizar la compra de una laptop, la cual le servir\u00e1 de mucho para poder realizar sus trabajos educativos, as\u00ed pues Jaime espera poder brindar una mejor calidad de educaci\u00f3n a sus alumnos y poco a poco desea poder alcanzar sus metas y su gran sue\u00f1o de formar su propia familia.\n","en":"Jaime, 37, is a single man.

With his loan, he intends to manually prepare the land. This is how he conserves the best soil - he buys fertilizer, corn seeds, and other products which he needs for cultivation. Furthermore, it is to pay for the labor of growing and caring for the crops by manually eliminating weeds to avoid use of chemicals, as well as some cultivation work like making layers to avoid soil erosion due to the rain. This helps him assure good work. With the possibility of this loan, he hopes to have everything prepared on time and to take advantage of the rainy season, as well as to put many years of experience into practice as he handles basic crops. Additionally, he will be able to buy the best, top quality products so that his plantation will be well-designed and healthy, and to have adequate production in the short-term. He will use the income from the harvest that he hopes to obtain to complete some family goals and continue investing in more crops. This is his first loan received from FUDECOSUR.

She lives with her husband and their three children, whom she raises in the house they own. Sixteen years ago, she opened a grocery shop in her house and has been tending to it since, with the help of her children, who attend customers when she needs to buy supplies or has business in town. Carola's shop is open every day, including Sundays. In the morning, she sells mostly bread or breakfast fare, which is very good for business. This encourages her to think brightly of the future, and her wish is to keep improving her business. It is the only shop she owns, but she has taken to selling food and all manner of beverages in the cemetery for All Saints', when people visit the graves of their loved ones. This is why she asks for this loan, so as not to lose such a good opportunity for business.

","en":"Daler is a young, single man who lives with his parents. For the past 5 years, he has been working in the field of building renovations. His father is a security guard and his mother is a homemaker. The salaries of both Daler and his father go to support the family.

She lives with her 3 children: Madeli, Dayana, and Darlin, who she cares for in the house that she inherited 2 years ago. She is a fighting woman; since she was a young woman, she learned to care for her children all by herself. She doesn\u2019t get intimidated, as she has a lot of knowledge of life in the fields. Her main economic income centers on the production of milk; she has 2 cows, a calf and a bull. She hopes to be able to get ahead by acquiring more cows. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe business of selling milk is very good; a processing company buys the liters that my cows produce every day,\u201d she states. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s for this reason that a short time ago, she stopped sowing her fields in abundance; now, she only has small plots of land like beans and potatoes, which she continues selling but in smaller amounts. She hopes that the sale of a new milk cow will materialize so she can plant alfalfa on her farmland and in this way be able to feed her animals, as she wants to have more than 10 cows in production. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the collective group \u201cMujeres Yanamarquinas\u201d (Yanamarquina Women) and this is her 3rd loan with MFP, where she feels developed, since she receives economic help to progress in her business. Because of this, she promises to be punctual in paying off her quotas.

They have 5 children, but only 3 live with them: Clisver, Yuditza, and Roni.\r\n\r\nEvery morning with her husband she goes to their land where they grow beans, barley, potatoes, and other agricultural products. She has 25 years of experience in agriculture. What she enjoys most is to spend the majority of her days in the field and eating the natural products. She says that thanks to the support of her family, she was able to get her own agricultural land. Because she no longer has to pay rent, she will earn more revenue.\r\n\r\nShe is also dedicated to raising animals like pigs, sheep, and cows which provide many daily benefits. Wednesdays and Sundays the animals are taken to market in the city. She says, \"Thanks to the sale of the animals I get a permanent income for my family.\"\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the solidarity group \"mujeres yanamarquinas.\" This is her second loan with MPF. She feels it is well developed since you get economic aid to progress your business. Therefore she promises to be punctual with her payments. Yolanda will invest the money in the purchase of animals, an average of 10 sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1232103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 10 sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-11T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-11T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":152.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":172.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":187.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":201.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":218.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.52,"local_amount":152.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":152.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188772},{"amount":63.88,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":166.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572675},{"amount":66.16,"local_amount":172.59,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122341},{"amount":145.45,"local_amount":379.44,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":379.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576983},{"amount":157.36,"local_amount":410.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":411.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974437},{"amount":83.63,"local_amount":218.16,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":218.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995871}],"funded_date":"2012-11-11T11:40:02Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"SUZANNE FORD","image":915708}},{"id":493586,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9 tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene dos hijos, vive con su familia actualmente, el solicito un pr\u00e9stamo con el prop\u00f3sito de dar asistencia a su plantaci\u00f3n de chile.

She has been in this business for 15 years and sells to all categories of people both in retail and wholesale. Her major business challenges include transportation, thieves and seasonality.  She aspires to one day own a delivery van for transportation, to sell only wholesale, and to earn enough profit to buy a plot of land and build her own house.

He hopes to increase his profit and to pay for the school fees of his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1232493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy piglets, feed, and vaccines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Aurora, Quezon, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-11-11T04:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-11T04:30:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":34000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":27000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-22T09:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":27741.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357124008},{"amount":175,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7192.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400177521}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T19:53:27Z","paid_date":"2013-09-20T08:30:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Vacha","image":1668411}},{"id":493893,"name":"Binta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e vers 1982 \u00e0 Bougouni, Bitta est une c\u00e9libataire et m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant qui vit chez son p\u00e8re dans le quartier Heremakono Nord de Bougouni.   \nBinta m\u00e8ne cette activit\u00e9 d\u2019achat et de vente de tissus Burkinab\u00e9 et des v\u00eatements \u201cfriperie\u201d il y a environ cinq ans.

She has one child, who lives with the father in the district of Heremakono Nord, in Bougouni.\r\n\r\nBinta has been in the business of buying and selling clothing from Burkina Faso and second-hand clothing for about five years. She enjoys a great reputation in the business and gets many orders, especially before the holidays and in the cold season. She thus decided to join Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s program. She is on her second individual loan with the organization, after having duly repaid the previous loan. With this second loan, she is planning on purchasing two lots of Burkinabe clothing from itinerant sellers. She will then resell them door-to-door, to a clientele mostly composed of the town\u2019s household heads.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly benefit of 50,000 FCFA. It will mostly be reinvested to contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and to repay her loan and its interests, with the remainder to be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1232529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She knows that through this loan she could ensure the proper growth of her hogs. In addition, she could help her parents in preparing the farm plot and buying some farm supplies. Rosalina assures that she can obtain greater profit due to her hard labor and adaptation of new techniques in raising healthy hogs and producing corn crops.

She lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband and children in the house she inherited from her parents many years ago. Her life has always been in constant contact with field work, as her parents and her grandmother taught her since she was a small child. \r\n\r\nFarming and animal husbandry have always been a part of her life, even more so as her work and effort are for the benefit of her children who are dependent on her. She supports each one's education.\r\n\r\nAna dedicates every day to raising cows and bulls. She buys them when they are young and then fattens them up to sell. She also feeds her cows well so that she can later breed them, and during the lactation period, milk them and sell them. For this she has built a stable at her house for her cows and bulls; she raises them with such dedication and love that she gives each one a name. \r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to build a small dairy for which she is preparing and training herself.
